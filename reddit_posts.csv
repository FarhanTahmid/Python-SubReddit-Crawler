28,000 signatures so far! 

16 years ago, I was robbed of clitoral sensation permanently due to OB/GYN ignorance of clitoral anatomy. The nerves in the clitoris still aren‚Äôt getting taught, putting other women at risk. Please help me change this so that other women are not harmed like I was.¬†

The nerves in the clitoris are 2-3 mm in diameter and travel superficially under the clitoral hood skin.

As such, they are vulnerable to injury and put at risk in a number of procedures OB/GYNs perform: biopsies, clitoral hood reductions, and repairs after childbirth, sexual assault, and straddle injuries. Understanding this anatomy is also important in diagnosing and managing female sexual dysfunction.¬†

Unfortunately, though the nerves in the clitoris were published in 1844 and many times since, they were omitted from OB/GYN literature until 2019. Though I‚Äôve gotten studies published and multiple textbooks updated with this anatomy, it‚Äôs still not getting taught to most OB/GYNs.¬†

The American College of OB/GYNs has the power to help dictate what gets taught. But they recently said, in an email, that the nerves in the clitoris ‚Äúdo not fit‚Äù in their recommended CREOG curriculum for OB/GYNs.¬†

If they would include it, this would help ensure OB/GYNs are being taught this anatomy, which is critical for female sexual function.¬†  


Personally, the nerves in my clitoris were injured in a clitoral hood reduction done without my consent during a labiaplasty. I lost clitoral sensation permanently. After my surgery, I was told by every OB/GYN I went to for help that my loss couldn‚Äôt have been caused by my surgery and was all in my head.¬†

16 years later, not one top 20 OB/GYN program will agree to teach this anatomy, despite being entreated to do so by me and my plastic surgeon father.¬†

There are many other women with stories like mine, who have lost clitoral function after biopsies, cosmetic surgeries, and repairs (including one after a rape). Preventable damage done during repairs likely goes unrecognized because women assume the original injury caused the damage, rather than their doctor.¬†  


My loss was so traumatic it felt sometimes worse than death. It is made more painful knowing my injury isn‚Äôt considered worth preventing. But it is worth preventing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/kf0d1g/please_sign_petition_to_get_nerves_in_the/,Please sign petition to get nerves in the clitoris included in ACOG‚Äôs curriculum.

1. Vaginal discharge is normal.

2. Wearing panty liners 24/7 is not necessary.

3. Vaginas are acidic enough to BLEACH fabric, hence the discoloration of underwear.

4. Longer labias are more normal than smaller ones (but both are fine).

5. A mans sperm CAN throw off your ph balance and also change the smell of your vagina

6. It is not safe for vaginas to smell like sunshine and flowers so quit expecting it to.

7. STOP douching and washing your vagina with bath&body works, and Victoria secret. Shits not healthy for the vagina.

8. The vagina cleans itself.

9. Having sex has no correlation of how ""tight"" your vagina is.

10. Yeast infections are COMMON!!!

11. The best thing you can do for your vagina is to leave it alone.üò¥

12. If your vagina stinks or your discharge stink and has a color than go see a gynecologist and stop trying to blame cause you stink.

13. Let it breathe.

14. The VAGINA is the narrow canal that runs INSIDE the body. NOT the whole genital area.  
\*Do not use soap in your vagina.\*

15. Always urinate after sex to rinse the urinary tract of fluids that could be caught there and can cause UTIs.

16. Drink water.

17. COTTON panties ladies. Wearing silk, satin and lace seven days a week will abso-fucking-lutely throw your Ph off.

Don't argue with me about this. I don't give a fuck if you say your mama put you in satin diapers and all you've ever worn is satin panties. If that's true, YOUR SHIT IS OFF.  I GUARANTEE it.

18. Stop sprinkling powder on your lady bits, stop IMMEDIATELY! Talcum causes cancer. This isn't a hoax or a joke and I don't care if your 97 year old great Aunt Myrtle has been using it twice a day, everyday. STOP IT! TODAY!

19. Also the Vagina is a natural sperm killer, except when you‚Äôre ovulating with the exception of a very high ph level.

20. This is all correct and true. Stop letting men who think washing their ass and moisturizing is gay try and tell you how to care for your ladybits. Ladies, stop letting boys who got sex ed from Pornhub tell you about YOUR vagina.

16mput6,WomensHealth,1695127073.0,"So I am 40 I decided I was done having kids and wanted to go back on BC. 

I went to the gynaecologist here in Greece where I live now. I was dreading it because all my experiences with the GYNO in America have been shoving fingers uncomfortably into you and pressing just uncomfortable. 

My exam in Greece was done w a very slender ultrasound wand. No pain. No Rando up in my business. 

We then discussed Birth control. Here you get blood work first and then they prescribe a Birth control pill that pairs with your blood work results. - literally never in America 

Then he told me that after 40 they are hesitant to prescribe the pill because that can increase breast cancer and before 40 the pill can cause blood clots which is why they make all women regardless of age do blood work before they prescribe BC pills (which is free here BTW) - did NOT know any of this. 

He then suggested an IUD. The Mirena which I heard was super painful to insert. 

Here in Greece they insert it at a hospital with General anesthesia because it hurts so bad. It takes an HR and is an in and out patient procedure simple stream lined no pain. 

He then told me that they are NOT ever supposed to insert it in the office unless the women has had a vaginal birth and even then it would probably hurt. They can however remove it in the office. 

In America they make women suffer regardless of how the Mierna IUD guidelines because they are too cheap to care about us.

 The US health care is complete and utter garbage. 

I actually have health care here because I‚Äôm working so I pay into the Greek tax payers system. Which just mean prescriptions are free and any public hospital is free. 

A dr visit here is about 40-50 euros which is the same as my coepay was in America 5 years ago when I left.

i48i58,Periods,1596644888.0,"Last year I was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 38. I underwent months of treatment, including a radical hysterectomy, chemotherapy, and targeted radiation. Thankfully I'm currently NED (no evidence of disease) and I'm hopeful that it won't return. This is the story of how I found out I had cancer, my hope is that by sharing it maybe it will encourage others to go to the doctor and get screened before it's too late. ***Fair warning some of this is a little graphic.***

It started about six to eight months before my diagnosis. It happened gradually. My periods started getting heavier and longer. At first I blamed it on stress and weight fluctuations. I was under a ton of stress at work and actually ended up quitting my job (after being there almost a decade). I had also recently lost 70 pounds and regained 30 of it. Surely this must be the reason for my crazy periods, right? (Edit to add: my periods were often irregular so that's another reason I didn't take it seriously at first.)  

Eventually it got to the point where my periods just didn't stop. Yet I put off going to the doctor and continued to make rationalizations. It's important to note that the heavy, out-of-the-ordinary bleeding was the *only* symptom I had. I was not in pain, had no cramps, nothing else odd or worrying. I learned later that this is not unusual. Heavier/longer periods is often the only warning sign most uterine/ovarian cancer patients get, it also happens in about 90% of endometrial cancer cases. I wish I had known that.  

Then it happened. The day came when I couldn't ignore it anymore. I was at my new job going about my day when I suddenly had what can only be described as a contraction. (I've never been pregnant or given birth, so it was like nothing I've ever felt before.) Instinctively I knew what was about to happen and ran to the bathroom. I spent the next hour hemorrhaging blood and endometrial tissue. It was traumatic and disgusting.   

I had a friend drive me to the emergency room. I had lost so much blood that I ultimately ended up needing five blood transfusions. At first the doctor thought I might be having a miscarriage, but I definitely wasn't pregnant. So they did a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. Immediately I was rushed into surgery to stop the bleeding and scrape out my uterus (common procedure called a D&C). I don't remember a lot of the details of that night, but I certainly remember my surgeon coming to speak to me afterward. She said she didn't have to wait for the pathology results to know I had cancer and that she was referring me to an oncologist for further treatment and a hysterectomy. Up until that point it had never occurred to me that it could be cancer. Somehow I'd completely blocked out that possibility - considered every other option but that. Denial is a powerful thing.   

So, if you have increasingly heavier or longer than normal periods (or bleeding after menopause) does that mean you have cancer? No, not necessarily. Other things can cause it. But it does mean you NEED to get *thoroughly* checked out by a doctor. Ask for a CA-125 blood test, ultrasound, and/or biopsy to screen for cancer (and if they refuse say you want their refusal documented in your chart and that you want a copy). Some doctors might just try to give you birth control pills and send you on your way, don't let them. Be your own advocate. If they say you're ""too young"" to have cancer that's a red flag, my cancer support group is full of 20 and 30 year olds who were told this. Sadly some were not taken seriously until it was too late. It is also important to note that a pap smear only checks for cervical cancer, not uterine or ovarian cancer. So listen to your body and if something is out of the ordinary get checked out.  

TL;DR increasingly heavy/irregular/longer than normal periods are often the *only* warning sign of uterine or ovarian cancer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/i48i58/how_i_found_out_i_had_uterine_cancer_and_what/,How I found out I had uterine cancer and what every woman should know about her period...,Health,775,62,1.0,digitalvagrant

We were talking about how irritating it is society deems vaginal tightness as a goal, and how we'd give anything to be looser. After we said this, a friend got emotional and told us how she thought she was the only one with Vaginismus because its not openly spoken about. This friend is in her 30s guys.
 Imagine carrying that around with you for all those years, the shame, the guilt, the anger. 

And then it got us all thinking, why is none of this ever spoken about? Sex Ed at school? If you're lucky to get any in the first place, all you're taught is how pregnancy happens, a bit about STIs and birth control. That's all. Why aren't we talking about COMMON issues? No ones being taught about:
 Painful Sex,
Vaginal Dryness,
Discharge,
 Thrush, 
Bacterial Vaginosis,
Menstruation and what the different shades of blood are, or clots. 
The Vagina is self cleaning, so only clean the vulva.

Can you imagine how many young vagina- owners there are going round thinking they're not normal, when in reality, they're pretty normal. 

How many are carrying this with them into adulthood and not speaking to anyone about it because its seen as taboo?

15ak0u8,Healthyhooha,1690410755.0,"For just about as long as I‚Äôve been sexually active (about 10 years) I‚Äôve experienced this painful papercut-like tear everytime I‚Äôve had penetrative sex of any kind.

It would happen right at the base of the vaginal opening (perineal area) leading to a stinging burning sensation that would bleed just a litttttlleeeeee bit. Obviously super uncomfortable and distracting. 

It didn‚Äôt really occur to me that this shouldn‚Äôt really be happening, I just figured it was normal for the longest time. 

When I told my current partner of 7 years she felt so bad because she had no idea that it was happening and felt horrible. That was probably like 2-3 years ago. So we‚Äôd try different positions, lubes, toys, fingers, take even longer for foreplay, etc. nothing helped. To be clear too, it‚Äôs not the actual deep penetration that hurts, it‚Äôs just at the entrance.

After about a year of trying different things I finally canned up and talked to a doctor. I explicitly mentioned to her that arousal and lubrication was not an issue. I told her that I did not need any information on these but needed information on anything else that could be causing that. She sounded like she was listening, but after my appointment she wrote me a prescription for birth control and sent me lists of lubes to use and podcasts on arousal. 

I was so upset y‚Äôall, I cried. And then I had to pay the $80 copay. It was so frustrating.

I ended up taking a few more months to reach out to another doctor and put my foot down. I asked the nurse to order me a full STI, BV, UTI, and yeast panel. I went in last week and had all the tests done. This doctor was a lot more patient and took a solid 30 minutes with me instead of the last doctor. 

She mentioned it possibly being HPV a first guess, but otherwise ‚Äúchronic inflammation and irritation.‚Äù She asked if I wear tight clothes/thongs often. I don‚Äôt really wear tight clothes but I do wear thongs daily unless I‚Äôm on my period. She suggested I switch to something more comfortable and go commando when possible. 

A few days later all tests came back negative but I kept up with her other suggestions.

Y‚Äôall. I waited like 4 days and my partner and I had sex after making these changes and almost all the pain was gone. It was so nice to have sex without the pain again. I used to tense up so much, worried, and I could never relax.

I‚Äôm so happy I found a solution, but frustrated it took me this long. I was browsing other subreddits with other people posting this issue with no resolution, so I wanted to also post in case anyone else had this issue.

1745f0w,Healthyhooha,1696891580.0,"Why do so many shows and comedians make jokes about smelly vaginas? Who are these jokes for, just men, or do women also think they're funny? I feel like they're punching down, and they're unfair since only about 50% of the world is affected. And no woman can actually stand up against the jokes because people will just say, why are you offended, does your vagina smell?

I keep starting new tv shows thinking the topic won't come up but it so often does! Unless I watch a kid friendly comedy series, it's always just a matter of time before someone makes a joke about vaginas. Is it because we think women with them are unhygienic, or too sexual, and therefore merit the joke as punishment? The jokes just feel really shitty because it's very out of your control. So many women get recurring bv and it's not necessarily even due to sexual reasons - they can be caused by antibiotics taken for other reasons. Mine started in childhood, I'm guessing it was due to antibiotics or something else out of my control! But even if it's caused by sex, it's not a women's fault if they try treatment but end up with recurring BV. Recurring BV is not well understand by science and that's no one's fault.

I'm just so sick of being the butt of jokes that cause a lot of shame. And watching TV shows that are fun for everyone else unaffected.

14bfkre,Healthyhooha,1686970742.0,"First Reddit post in a while and like my third ever. Seeking help as it‚Äôs late at night during a weekend and can‚Äôt see a doctor til Monday most likely. Sorry if this is TMI. PICS ATTACHED. 

I was using the bathroom and when I wiped, I saw a black dot on the paper. Found it weird, wiped again and there‚Äôs was another. I then reach down there and touch with my hand and find even more! I quickly wash myself with water from the sink til there‚Äôs no more. 

But something told me ‚Äúcheck inside‚Äù. So I digged inside (after washing my hands) and THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE. It was mixed with white, odorless discharge (as pictured in comments). This is where I really start freaking out because WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! And when I squished them with my fingers, there was like a black powder or paste that came out of them (as pictured in comments). 

Like I said, I definitely plan to go to the OBGYN on Monday but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced or even heard of this before because no one I know has and I‚Äôm freaking out !!!

Thanks in advance.


UPDATE: Hello everyone. I‚Äôm super late (sorry!) but here‚Äôs my update.

1) I definitely wasn‚Äôt trolling!! Didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing on here, especially on the type of communities I posted on (women‚Äôs health). I really was just freaking out on a random night where I couldn‚Äôt see my Obgyn for a few days and ran to the internet for advice. 

2) Since I‚Äôm not an avid Reddit user, seeing all the comments I got (some negative, some positive) gave me SO much anxiety and I just deleted the app lol. I just signed back into my account recently and remembered this so thought I‚Äôd update!

3) Here‚Äôs the story: I did go to the emergency room even though I was hesitant just because I wanted whatever was in there to still have some trace that it was in there and waiting til Monday wasn‚Äôt going to guarantee that. 

IT ENDED UP BEING BORIC ACID. A couple days prior to this, I had sex and afterwards smelled a light smell so I decided to pop in a boric acid suppository overnight. For those that don‚Äôt know, the suppository just dissolves on its own and you don‚Äôt think about it again. Turns out that this suppository just .. didn‚Äôt dissolve completely? It just stayed there for a couple days and since the vagina is self-cleaning, it started pushing out the contents and that‚Äôs when I first saw it when wiping. No one in the ER could tell me why they turned black but they reassured me I wasn‚Äôt dying and that I was going to be okay so I was good with that!! Scary and embarrassing experience but I am glad I went and got it checked out sooner rather than later. 

Also just wanna say thanks to everyone who was nice, caring, and helpful. For the one who doubted that it was real: I get it.

I am a 23 year old female who has been suffering from an itchy vulva/butt for five and a half months. I‚Äôve seen many suffer with that on this reddit so I wanna share my story and hopefully help in some way. 
I‚Äôve always suffered with intermittent vulva itching but if I‚Äôm being honest, I kinda ignored it but last October it got really bad. I went to planned parenthood and they said I had a yeast infection, did an STD test and sent me on my way with antibiotics. The itching didnt go away. I returned to planned parenthood two more times, they gave me a steroid cream that did not help and continuously treated me for a yeast infection I did not have and did repetive STD tests. Eventually, they pretty much said they couldnt do anything. I then went to a gynochologist who gave me ANOTHER steroid, also tested me for STD‚Äôs and gave me more yeast pills. After two months of suffering I was over it and decided to go to a dermatologist. The first dermatologist was horribly rude, looked at me for literally 10 seconds and said it looked fine but gave me a steroid cream anyways. This cream gave me a terrible rash. I went to a second dermatologist who was male and clearly uncomfortable looking at my genitals. He looked at me for about 2 seconds and gave me an antifungal cream and more yeast pills lol. I was at my wits end. I could barely do anything, I couldnt work out so I was gaining weight, I couldnt have sex, and showering made things horribly worse. I finally decided to go to a third dermatologist who honestly saved me. She was the first dermatologist to use a dermascope on my vulva (the microscope that derms use), and also checked my butt, elbows, head and fingers with it. She looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou so clearly have psoriosis on multiple parts of your body including your genitals. I am shocked nobody noticed this, I wish you had seen me 5 months ago‚Äù. I honestly burst into tears because it was so nice having someone actually take me seriously and not automatically assume I have a yeast infection or an STD. I explained psorious and autoimmune diseases run in my family and she figured out that one of my psychiatric medications can trigger psoriosis. She gave me a topical psoriosis cream and has told me to supplement with Vitamin D. I have already started to feel better and its only been a week. While ‚Äúcured‚Äù isnt the right word for my issues because psoriosis is a long term condition, it can get better with certain medications and lifestyle changes. All I have to say is, please please please advocate for yourself. I let the doctors walk all over me for 5 months even though I knew there was something off. I hope this can help in anyway or at least give you hope that it is possible to get better.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/mo47qq/found_a_cure_for_my_itchy_vulva/,Found a cure for my itchy vulva!!, Community Updates,587,58,1.0,ps3226
rxdnqm,Healthyhooha,1641472777.0,"Why the fuck do people become gynecologists if they're gonna judge you for seeking treatment? Some of these doctors are borderline incompetent too, it's infuriating. (Context: I live in a very conservative country.)

So I (21F) have had issues with my thyroid for  almost three years now and I was unmedicated for a good chunk of that time which took a huge toll on my body. 

I guess because my hormones are all out of whack, I've been chronically dry down there with low libido and diminished physical sensation, and my bartholin's glands have been partially blocked for over a year because the fluid is too viscous.

Not exactly A-OK. So I visit a gynecologist. Did she prescribe medication or order further blood tests? Nope. 

She asked me ""why do you care so much about being dry if you're unmarried?"" Apparently it's not a problem worth treating if I'm not actively in pain, because I'm an unmarried woman. My body is not functioning as it should and I want it fixed, is that not a good enough reason? 

Awkward moment aside she decides to do a physical examination anyway. Apparently there's ""absolutely nothing wrong with me"" and ""how would you (21F, unmarried) even *know* you're too dry?"" Because only married people get wet and experience sexual arousal, apparently. Unmarried women are just oblivious to their vagina's existence until marriage, don't you know? 

I'm not having any of this, so I explain that I've previously had a blocked (painless) bartholin's gland which I developed after my thyroid issues started, hoping that might elicit some helpful advice. She told me it's because I have pubic hair which must mean I'm unhygienic. That's about when I gave up.

I'm not even surprised. This isn't even uncommon behavior among gynecologists here. I'm sick of begging doctors to do their job.

Last night I peed and noticed a long hair (from my head) hanging down and went to pull it thinking nothing of it. It wouldn‚Äôt budge. Panicked slightly because I have an IUD and thought it was the strings but nope, a long hair. I put a finger in my vagina and felt a weird lump on the side of my wall with the hair attached to it and had the horrible realization that it was somehow tangled up in there. Boyfriend felt around and agreed it felt concerning. I called the on call number for my gyn and they said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be seen until Tuesday, otherwise I‚Äôd have to go to the ED. 

I went this morning and after a 5 hr wait, had a young male resident have a look and said it was wrapped around a piece of my vaginal tissue and cutting off the circulation. I should also mention that I work at this hospital so it‚Äôs especially mortifying that I had to go in for this. He looked at his attending and said there was no way he could get it but that the tissue was dark from circulation being cut off so they called OB. At this point I‚Äôm crying and freaking out.

A young girl cries on a cold stone floor. She shivers and seizes as the blood pools around her skirts. Her mother will find her next to a cup of pennyroyal. She is buried in the village churchyard under a shroud of shame. A young boy attends the funeral and sheds a single tear, then turns to find comfort in the arms of another girl.

A woman in her forties walks down dark stairs to a darker basement. She hopes this won‚Äôt take long; she has three children at home, waiting for their dinner. She learned of this place from a friend of a friend. Whispered under the roar of machines meant to break their backs and their will. Waiting for her is a cold metal table and a cold hearted man telling her to lie down. She will not make it home for dinner.

A new woman, nineteen, and on her own for the first time. There‚Äôs a party tonight, and she wants to look her best. The music is loud and the house is crowded. She doesn‚Äôt care that it smells like stale beer and sweat. There is a cute boy in the corner who offers her a drink. She thinks he‚Äôs nice and takes it from him. The next morning she doesn‚Äôt remember the boy, doesn‚Äôt know why she is waking up on a strange floor, why she smells of stale beer and sweat. Three weeks later she takes a test. It is not the kind you can study for but still she gets a positive result. She tries to tell someone. They ask her: What were you wearing? Were you drunk? She can‚Äôt remember. Is this her fault, she asks herself. She asks the doctor. He says yes. You must live with the consequences. Consequences. The word echoes through her body as she drags the knife across her flesh.

A woman, newly married, full of promise, lays in a hospital bed. She caresses the swell of her stomach, whispers loving words. The doctors enter, frowns on their faces, and she feels the dread begin to rise. They use big words that she has read in books, in the sections she tries to avoid. Her husband‚Äôs knuckles whiten against the bed rail. Options, they ask together. One doctor shakes his head. Her daughter will grow up without her mother.

Twelve faces judge a woman wearing orange. It doesn‚Äôt matter her age. They call her a murderer. They call her a whore. They say she had no right. The judge and the law agree. Her tears mean nothing. She should have thought of this before. When, she asks herself, was she supposed to think about the rest of her life? At the doctor‚Äôs office? On the drive out of state? When her lover said he didn‚Äôt care? Or when they laid down together as they had so many times before? When she chose a pill over a copper device? When she first met him, or the other hims before, from the very first? When? She has her whole life to find the answer.

Dear Seemingly Uneducated School Board,

Unfortunately the problem that female anatomy is an inconvenience to you and is not important enough to miss school has been brought to attention, so here are some scenarios that may help you understand why some girls don‚Äôt want to go to school during ‚Äúthat time of the month‚Äù. Imagine that for one week straight every month of the year blood *oozes* out of one of the most sensitive parts in your body, it sounds annoying right? Now on top of that imagine that as the blood *oozes* out you have uncontrollable emotional outbursts. Then, add on the pain of a neverending muscle cramp. Now for that entire week of blood, unexplainable emotions, and the never ending cramp inside your stomach whose pain is equal to a heart attack, not going to school is not an option because letting a child stay home for more than ten unexcused absences is illegal. 

A girl usually has her period once a month for seven days making that sixty-three days a school year that a girl is on her period and only **ten** of those she can stay home. So for sixty-three days you go to school miserable and in pain because you would rather the school didn‚Äôt call social services on your parents *just* because you were experiencing menstruation. Not all girls will even need more than one day at home, but those ‚Äúone days‚Äù add up.

Every woman's period is different. Some have a blood flow so heavy that they resort to wearing all black along with having a tampon up, a pad down, and wearing their ugliest pair of underwear just in case they get ruined. Others may just be fine wearing a panty liner. Some have pain, some have none, and some have serious medical conditions that make cramps so bad they can barely walk. So whoever it was (male or female) that came out and said, ‚Äúhey, it really doesn‚Äôt hurt that bad, girls don‚Äôt need to stay home for this‚Äù can shove it right up their ass unless they have experienced every girl's pain. 

I am writing this letter because, believe it or not, **I am a female**. I remember having my first period. It was in the middle of a volleyball game when I squatted down and all of the sudden a gush of hot, sticky blood soaked right into my spandex. I spent the night crying of embarrassment and in pain, but I would still have to show up to school the next day. 

Lucky for me, I got to spend my day in the ER because I experienced a very common side effect of menstruation: An **ovarian cyst**. 

A cyst is a little pouch sitting on your ovary that fills with liquid causing pain or discomfort. A ruptured cyst is explained to be more painful than appendicitis and child labor. According to Sergio Vignali, who is an OB/Gyn physician, ‚Äúmost women develop at least one cyst every month‚Äù. Some females don‚Äôt even realize they have them and their cysts go away with their period. It depends on the female if the cyst will burst or not, but unfortunately I developed four cysts that burst all in the same day. So, go back to where you're pretending that you're oozing blood, crying, and cramping, and now add on a ticking time bomb sitting on your ovary that may or may not go off any given moment.

  Do *you* still want to go to school?

Now that you have a very *small* understanding of females go through during ‚Äúthat time of the month,‚Äù hopefully you will reconsider your attendance protocols because no, parents aren't committing truancy by letting their daughter stay home. They are taking care of their child's physical and emotional needs. So, until you put a woman's anatomy inside you and feel what they feel, **don‚Äôt** minimize their pain, just let them have the damn day off.

g36lad,WomensHealth,1587144979.0,"Today I found out what the real role of a hymen is. I was listening to [this podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszj31) on BBC sounds where two gynecologists were discussing issues related to women's reproductive systems, common myths, and harmful practices. Dr. Jen Gunter was asked about the hymen, and this is an excerpt from her response: 

*""The hymen exists to protect the infant vagina from urine and feces and dirt. Because right when you‚Äôre born, the vagina doesn‚Äôt have any estrogen and is incredibly vulnerable to irritants. As we start to walk and become continent of urine and feces, the hymen becomes pliable and takes on different shapes because we don‚Äôt need it anymore. So the hymen is the exact equivalent of baby teeth. It‚Äôs something that we needed developmentally for a small period of time, and then it‚Äôs discarded when we don‚Äôt need it anymore. It‚Äôs got different kinds of shapes and pliability, it‚Äôs in no way a reflection of virginity. That‚Äôs a social construct which is very harmful to women.""* 

I'm sharing this because it was the first time I had ever seen the explanation of the role of a hymen. Until now, I did not know what the role of a hymen was, I just thought it's just the tissue that exists. I knew it was unrelated to virginity, but I didn't know what it did, which I think is quite telling of the education we receive about the female reproductive system. I just wanted to share this information because I believe that it is very empowering to know your body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/g36lad/psa_the_actual_role_of_a_hymen/,PSA: The actual role of a hymen,,539,44,1.0,Zanbakh

This happened two weeks ago.

It was a Thursday afternoon at work and my coworkers and I started to get a whiff of something... unsavory. This is not unusual because I work in the cancer center of a large hospital. As with any patient care role, you encounter a lot of smells that you didn't know even existed. And they can be bad.

This one was bad.

We wondered at first if it was a dead mouse, checking under desks and counters, or maybe the red biohazard bag hadn't been changed. We emptied all the trash cans and still the smell remained. It would come in wafts and seemed to follow us wherever we went.

That's when the usual ""oh God is it me?!"" fear kicked in. We smelled each other and checked our shoes but couldn't pinpoint the stench.

Around lunchtime I went to the employee lounge on the other side of the department, sat down, and had the sinking realization that that smell was definitely coming from me. Something was seriously wrong with my pussy and other people could *fucking smell it oh my god.*

I ran to the bathroom, dropped trou, and bent over to inspect my underwear. I had just finished my period a few days prior, so there was some brownish discharge, but that wasn't unusual. It did smell a little but it wasn't overpowering in that moment. I googled it (obviously) and found some info online about how sometimes discharge can be smelly at the end of your period. And mine have changed somewhat over the last year since I got an IUD so maybe that was it?

I anxiously completed the work day, my legs squeezed together whenever possible, and continued to help my coworkers search for a dead rat.

The worst moment was that at one point I moved my leg or something and a wave of the stink rose up like the Dark Mark. My coworker who was sitting by me actually stood up and moved. I wanted to die.

Friday went similarly except the smell was even worse. I was hoping it would magically disappear but no dice. Embarrassingly enough I actually threw away my underwear around 1pm (I had brought an extra) because the dried discharge smelled like actual death. I began to wonder if there was something going on here.

I made an appointment with planned parenthood for Monday evening and hoped it wasn't anything worse than a standard case of BV or something.

Over the weekend I warned my boyfriend of the chemical hazard brewing but we had sex anyways because we are trash. It was a horrible horrible decision ladies and gents. Afterwards his penis smelled god awful and my vagina felt like it was on fire. He gently assured me it was fine and didn't smell that bad but honestly the whole room reeked.

Monday I came equipped to work with a pack of pantyliners that I changed out every 45 minutes or so. The vagina goddesses were smiling upon me that day because this method worked and there was no noticeable smell that day.

Finally at long last I made it to my appointment and was anxiously waiting bare-bottomed under a paper sheet. The nurse had agreed that it seemed like a case of BV and some antibiotics would clear it right up.

The doctor came in and had me assume the position as we chatted about my symptoms. She was still talking as she inserted the speculum and stated to examine me but then stopped mid-sentence.

Slowly she closed her eyes, leaned back, and said ""Joyce, get the bag.""

I was thinking get the bag, GET THE BAG? FOR?!

And in that moment, she extracted the most disgusting tampon in the world from its horrible chamber. It's smell was instant and overpowering. I swear I heard it scream out as she tossed it in the biohazard bag.

I. Was. Mortified.

It must've been in there a week!! How could I forget a tampon?! How did my boyfriend not notice it?!

The doctor insisted it was actually pretty common and not to be embarrassed but holy shit.

I got a call today from the gynecologist that my first swab was a false positive & that my second swab came back clear.

o1dz3x,Healthyhooha,1623873675.0,"Hello from Vegas! I wanted to make a little update post because we finally have an answer and there's a lot that's happened since I made the original post.

If you recall, I had a very painful weeping ulcer on my vulva, along with some pelvic pain. I later noticed some yellow discharge. Everyone thought it was a Bartholin's Cyst until the gyno got a look at it and said he didn't know what it was but he wanted to test for herpes, the lab fucked up and tested it for covid, I was freaking out because the spot was healing and I didn't think I could get it retested.

So where are we now?

Well, about a day after I made the post, I requested a full panel of STI tests (including an HSV blood test, but my doctor said no to that one because of how unreliable they are). I spent a day out and about, and then woke up the next day in incredible pain. The spot was back and it was PISSED. I immediately requested to be seen again, somewhat hopeful that they could give the swab test another go. I saw a different (and, honestly nicer) gyno who swabbed me but also ordered the HSV blood test to corroborate the results. I got the blood drawn for some STI tests, and tried to get myself to pee in a cup for the rest of them. I am very bad at peeing on command so I ended up having to give up and go back TWICE to get anything to come out.

So, it's Monday morning, and my family and I are leaving for a little Vegas Father's Day trip in the afternoon. I am FINALLY able to pee in the cup to finish off all of the tests and as we head to Vegas, test results start coming in.

HIV? Negative
HepB? Negative
Syphilis? Negative
HSV-1 and HSV-2? Both negative from the swab (thank God)

Then, while sitting poolside I get a final notification, this one from the pee test, and announce probably too excitedly

""I HAVE CHLAMYDIA!""

So, here I am now, waiting to get my azithromycin prescription sent over to the CVS and getting another set up for my girlfriend, and through a few sitz baths the spot has healed up for real this time.
