28,000 signatures so far! 

16 years ago, I was robbed of clitoral sensation permanently due to OB/GYN ignorance of clitoral anatomy. The nerves in the clitoris still aren‚Äôt getting taught, putting other women at risk. Please help me change this so that other women are not harmed like I was.¬†

The nerves in the clitoris are 2-3 mm in diameter and travel superficially under the clitoral hood skin.

As such, they are vulnerable to injury and put at risk in a number of procedures OB/GYNs perform: biopsies, clitoral hood reductions, and repairs after childbirth, sexual assault, and straddle injuries. Understanding this anatomy is also important in diagnosing and managing female sexual dysfunction.¬†

Unfortunately, though the nerves in the clitoris were published in 1844 and many times since, they were omitted from OB/GYN literature until 2019. Though I‚Äôve gotten studies published and multiple textbooks updated with this anatomy, it‚Äôs still not getting taught to most OB/GYNs.¬†

The American College of OB/GYNs has the power to help dictate what gets taught. But they recently said, in an email, that the nerves in the clitoris ‚Äúdo not fit‚Äù in their recommended CREOG curriculum for OB/GYNs.¬†

If they would include it, this would help ensure OB/GYNs are being taught this anatomy, which is critical for female sexual function.¬†  


Personally, the nerves in my clitoris were injured in a clitoral hood reduction done without my consent during a labiaplasty. I lost clitoral sensation permanently. After my surgery, I was told by every OB/GYN I went to for help that my loss couldn‚Äôt have been caused by my surgery and was all in my head.¬†

16 years later, not one top 20 OB/GYN program will agree to teach this anatomy, despite being entreated to do so by me and my plastic surgeon father.¬†

There are many other women with stories like mine, who have lost clitoral function after biopsies, cosmetic surgeries, and repairs (including one after a rape). Preventable damage done during repairs likely goes unrecognized because women assume the original injury caused the damage, rather than their doctor.¬†  


My loss was so traumatic it felt sometimes worse than death. It is made more painful knowing my injury isn‚Äôt considered worth preventing. But it is worth preventing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/kf0d1g/please_sign_petition_to_get_nerves_in_the/,Please sign petition to get nerves in the clitoris included in ACOG‚Äôs curriculum.

1. Vaginal discharge is normal.

2. Wearing panty liners 24/7 is not necessary.

3. Vaginas are acidic enough to BLEACH fabric, hence the discoloration of underwear.

4. Longer labias are more normal than smaller ones (but both are fine).

5. A mans sperm CAN throw off your ph balance and also change the smell of your vagina

6. It is not safe for vaginas to smell like sunshine and flowers so quit expecting it to.

7. STOP douching and washing your vagina with bath&body works, and Victoria secret. Shits not healthy for the vagina.

8. The vagina cleans itself.

9. Having sex has no correlation of how ""tight"" your vagina is.

10. Yeast infections are COMMON!!!

11. The best thing you can do for your vagina is to leave it alone.üò¥

12. If your vagina stinks or your discharge stink and has a color than go see a gynecologist and stop trying to blame cause you stink.

13. Let it breathe.

14. The VAGINA is the narrow canal that runs INSIDE the body. NOT the whole genital area.  
\*Do not use soap in your vagina.\*

15. Always urinate after sex to rinse the urinary tract of fluids that could be caught there and can cause UTIs.

16. Drink water.

17. COTTON panties ladies. Wearing silk, satin and lace seven days a week will abso-fucking-lutely throw your Ph off.

Don't argue with me about this. I don't give a fuck if you say your mama put you in satin diapers and all you've ever worn is satin panties. If that's true, YOUR SHIT IS OFF.  I GUARANTEE it.

18. Stop sprinkling powder on your lady bits, stop IMMEDIATELY! Talcum causes cancer. This isn't a hoax or a joke and I don't care if your 97 year old great Aunt Myrtle has been using it twice a day, everyday. STOP IT! TODAY!

19. Also the Vagina is a natural sperm killer, except when you‚Äôre ovulating with the exception of a very high ph level.

20. This is all correct and true. Stop letting men who think washing their ass and moisturizing is gay try and tell you how to care for your ladybits. Ladies, stop letting boys who got sex ed from Pornhub tell you about YOUR vagina.

16mput6,WomensHealth,1695127073.0,"So I am 40 I decided I was done having kids and wanted to go back on BC. 

I went to the gynaecologist here in Greece where I live now. I was dreading it because all my experiences with the GYNO in America have been shoving fingers uncomfortably into you and pressing just uncomfortable. 

My exam in Greece was done w a very slender ultrasound wand. No pain. No Rando up in my business. 

We then discussed Birth control. Here you get blood work first and then they prescribe a Birth control pill that pairs with your blood work results. - literally never in America 

Then he told me that after 40 they are hesitant to prescribe the pill because that can increase breast cancer and before 40 the pill can cause blood clots which is why they make all women regardless of age do blood work before they prescribe BC pills (which is free here BTW) - did NOT know any of this. 

He then suggested an IUD. The Mirena which I heard was super painful to insert. 

Here in Greece they insert it at a hospital with General anesthesia because it hurts so bad. It takes an HR and is an in and out patient procedure simple stream lined no pain. 

He then told me that they are NOT ever supposed to insert it in the office unless the women has had a vaginal birth and even then it would probably hurt. They can however remove it in the office. 

In America they make women suffer regardless of how the Mierna IUD guidelines because they are too cheap to care about us.

 The US health care is complete and utter garbage. 

I actually have health care here because I‚Äôm working so I pay into the Greek tax payers system. Which just mean prescriptions are free and any public hospital is free. 

A dr visit here is about 40-50 euros which is the same as my coepay was in America 5 years ago when I left.

i48i58,Periods,1596644888.0,"Last year I was diagnosed with uterine cancer at the age of 38. I underwent months of treatment, including a radical hysterectomy, chemotherapy, and targeted radiation. Thankfully I'm currently NED (no evidence of disease) and I'm hopeful that it won't return. This is the story of how I found out I had cancer, my hope is that by sharing it maybe it will encourage others to go to the doctor and get screened before it's too late. ***Fair warning some of this is a little graphic.***

It started about six to eight months before my diagnosis. It happened gradually. My periods started getting heavier and longer. At first I blamed it on stress and weight fluctuations. I was under a ton of stress at work and actually ended up quitting my job (after being there almost a decade). I had also recently lost 70 pounds and regained 30 of it. Surely this must be the reason for my crazy periods, right? (Edit to add: my periods were often irregular so that's another reason I didn't take it seriously at first.)  

Eventually it got to the point where my periods just didn't stop. Yet I put off going to the doctor and continued to make rationalizations. It's important to note that the heavy, out-of-the-ordinary bleeding was the *only* symptom I had. I was not in pain, had no cramps, nothing else odd or worrying. I learned later that this is not unusual. Heavier/longer periods is often the only warning sign most uterine/ovarian cancer patients get, it also happens in about 90% of endometrial cancer cases. I wish I had known that.  

Then it happened. The day came when I couldn't ignore it anymore. I was at my new job going about my day when I suddenly had what can only be described as a contraction. (I've never been pregnant or given birth, so it was like nothing I've ever felt before.) Instinctively I knew what was about to happen and ran to the bathroom. I spent the next hour hemorrhaging blood and endometrial tissue. It was traumatic and disgusting.   

I had a friend drive me to the emergency room. I had lost so much blood that I ultimately ended up needing five blood transfusions. At first the doctor thought I might be having a miscarriage, but I definitely wasn't pregnant. So they did a pelvic exam and an ultrasound. Immediately I was rushed into surgery to stop the bleeding and scrape out my uterus (common procedure called a D&C). I don't remember a lot of the details of that night, but I certainly remember my surgeon coming to speak to me afterward. She said she didn't have to wait for the pathology results to know I had cancer and that she was referring me to an oncologist for further treatment and a hysterectomy. Up until that point it had never occurred to me that it could be cancer. Somehow I'd completely blocked out that possibility - considered every other option but that. Denial is a powerful thing.   

So, if you have increasingly heavier or longer than normal periods (or bleeding after menopause) does that mean you have cancer? No, not necessarily. Other things can cause it. But it does mean you NEED to get *thoroughly* checked out by a doctor. Ask for a CA-125 blood test, ultrasound, and/or biopsy to screen for cancer (and if they refuse say you want their refusal documented in your chart and that you want a copy). Some doctors might just try to give you birth control pills and send you on your way, don't let them. Be your own advocate. If they say you're ""too young"" to have cancer that's a red flag, my cancer support group is full of 20 and 30 year olds who were told this. Sadly some were not taken seriously until it was too late. It is also important to note that a pap smear only checks for cervical cancer, not uterine or ovarian cancer. So listen to your body and if something is out of the ordinary get checked out.  

TL;DR increasingly heavy/irregular/longer than normal periods are often the *only* warning sign of uterine or ovarian cancer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/i48i58/how_i_found_out_i_had_uterine_cancer_and_what/,How I found out I had uterine cancer and what every woman should know about her period...,Health,777,62,1.0,digitalvagrant

After we said this, a friend got emotional and told us how she thought she was the only one with Vaginismus because its not openly spoken about. This friend is in her 30s guys.
 Imagine carrying that around with you for all those years, the shame, the guilt, the anger. 

And then it got us all thinking, why is none of this ever spoken about? Sex Ed at school? If you're lucky to get any in the first place, all you're taught is how pregnancy happens, a bit about STIs and birth control. That's all. Why aren't we talking about COMMON issues? No ones being taught about:
 Painful Sex,
Vaginal Dryness,
Discharge,
 Thrush, 
Bacterial Vaginosis,
Menstruation and what the different shades of blood are, or clots. 
The Vagina is self cleaning, so only clean the vulva.

Can you imagine how many young vagina- owners there are going round thinking they're not normal, when in reality, they're pretty normal.

15ak0u8,Healthyhooha,1690410755.0,"For just about as long as I‚Äôve been sexually active (about 10 years) I‚Äôve experienced this painful papercut-like tear everytime I‚Äôve had penetrative sex of any kind.

It would happen right at the base of the vaginal opening (perineal area) leading to a stinging burning sensation that would bleed just a litttttlleeeeee bit. Obviously super uncomfortable and distracting. 

It didn‚Äôt really occur to me that this shouldn‚Äôt really be happening, I just figured it was normal for the longest time. 

When I told my current partner of 7 years she felt so bad because she had no idea that it was happening and felt horrible. That was probably like 2-3 years ago. So we‚Äôd try different positions, lubes, toys, fingers, take even longer for foreplay, etc. nothing helped. To be clear too, it‚Äôs not the actual deep penetration that hurts, it‚Äôs just at the entrance.

After about a year of trying different things I finally canned up and talked to a doctor. I explicitly mentioned to her that arousal and lubrication was not an issue. I told her that I did not need any information on these but needed information on anything else that could be causing that. She sounded like she was listening, but after my appointment she wrote me a prescription for birth control and sent me lists of lubes to use and podcasts on arousal. 

I was so upset y‚Äôall, I cried. And then I had to pay the $80 copay. It was so frustrating.

I ended up taking a few more months to reach out to another doctor and put my foot down. I asked the nurse to order me a full STI, BV, UTI, and yeast panel. I went in last week and had all the tests done. This doctor was a lot more patient and took a solid 30 minutes with me instead of the last doctor. 

She mentioned it possibly being HPV a first guess, but otherwise ‚Äúchronic inflammation and irritation.‚Äù She asked if I wear tight clothes/thongs often. I don‚Äôt really wear tight clothes but I do wear thongs daily unless I‚Äôm on my period. She suggested I switch to something more comfortable and go commando when possible. 

A few days later all tests came back negative but I kept up with her other suggestions.

Y‚Äôall. I waited like 4 days and my partner and I had sex after making these changes and almost all the pain was gone. It was so nice to have sex without the pain again. I used to tense up so much, worried, and I could never relax.

I‚Äôm so happy I found a solution, but frustrated it took me this long. I was browsing other subreddits with other people posting this issue with no resolution, so I wanted to also post in case anyone else had this issue.

1745f0w,Healthyhooha,1696891580.0,"Why do so many shows and comedians make jokes about smelly vaginas? Who are these jokes for, just men, or do women also think they're funny? I feel like they're punching down, and they're unfair since only about 50% of the world is affected. And no woman can actually stand up against the jokes because people will just say, why are you offended, does your vagina smell?

I keep starting new tv shows thinking the topic won't come up but it so often does! Unless I watch a kid friendly comedy series, it's always just a matter of time before someone makes a joke about vaginas. Is it because we think women with them are unhygienic, or too sexual, and therefore merit the joke as punishment? The jokes just feel really shitty because it's very out of your control. So many women get recurring bv and it's not necessarily even due to sexual reasons - they can be caused by antibiotics taken for other reasons. Mine started in childhood, I'm guessing it was due to antibiotics or something else out of my control! But even if it's caused by sex, it's not a women's fault if they try treatment but end up with recurring BV. Recurring BV is not well understand by science and that's no one's fault.

I'm just so sick of being the butt of jokes that cause a lot of shame. And watching TV shows that are fun for everyone else unaffected.

14bfkre,Healthyhooha,1686970742.0,"First Reddit post in a while and like my third ever. Seeking help as it‚Äôs late at night during a weekend and can‚Äôt see a doctor til Monday most likely. Sorry if this is TMI. PICS ATTACHED. 

I was using the bathroom and when I wiped, I saw a black dot on the paper. Found it weird, wiped again and there‚Äôs was another. I then reach down there and touch with my hand and find even more! I quickly wash myself with water from the sink til there‚Äôs no more. 

But something told me ‚Äúcheck inside‚Äù. So I digged inside (after washing my hands) and THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE. It was mixed with white, odorless discharge (as pictured in comments). This is where I really start freaking out because WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?! And when I squished them with my fingers, there was like a black powder or paste that came out of them (as pictured in comments). 

Like I said, I definitely plan to go to the OBGYN on Monday but I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced or even heard of this before because no one I know has and I‚Äôm freaking out !!!

Thanks in advance.


UPDATE: Hello everyone. I‚Äôm super late (sorry!) but here‚Äôs my update.

1) I definitely wasn‚Äôt trolling!! Didn‚Äôt even know that was a thing on here, especially on the type of communities I posted on (women‚Äôs health). I really was just freaking out on a random night where I couldn‚Äôt see my Obgyn for a few days and ran to the internet for advice. 

2) Since I‚Äôm not an avid Reddit user, seeing all the comments I got (some negative, some positive) gave me SO much anxiety and I just deleted the app lol. I just signed back into my account recently and remembered this so thought I‚Äôd update!

3) Here‚Äôs the story: I did go to the emergency room even though I was hesitant just because I wanted whatever was in there to still have some trace that it was in there and waiting til Monday wasn‚Äôt going to guarantee that. 

IT ENDED UP BEING BORIC ACID. A couple days prior to this, I had sex and afterwards smelled a light smell so I decided to pop in a boric acid suppository overnight. For those that don‚Äôt know, the suppository just dissolves on its own and you don‚Äôt think about it again. Turns out that this suppository just .. didn‚Äôt dissolve completely? It just stayed there for a couple days and since the vagina is self-cleaning, it started pushing out the contents and that‚Äôs when I first saw it when wiping. No one in the ER could tell me why they turned black but they reassured me I wasn‚Äôt dying and that I was going to be okay so I was good with that!! Scary and embarrassing experience but I am glad I went and got it checked out sooner rather than later. 

Also just wanna say thanks to everyone who was nice, caring, and helpful. For the one who doubted that it was real: I get it.

I am a 23 year old female who has been suffering from an itchy vulva/butt for five and a half months. I‚Äôve seen many suffer with that on this reddit so I wanna share my story and hopefully help in some way. 
I‚Äôve always suffered with intermittent vulva itching but if I‚Äôm being honest, I kinda ignored it but last October it got really bad. I went to planned parenthood and they said I had a yeast infection, did an STD test and sent me on my way with antibiotics. The itching didnt go away. I returned to planned parenthood two more times, they gave me a steroid cream that did not help and continuously treated me for a yeast infection I did not have and did repetive STD tests. Eventually, they pretty much said they couldnt do anything. I then went to a gynochologist who gave me ANOTHER steroid, also tested me for STD‚Äôs and gave me more yeast pills. After two months of suffering I was over it and decided to go to a dermatologist. The first dermatologist was horribly rude, looked at me for literally 10 seconds and said it looked fine but gave me a steroid cream anyways. This cream gave me a terrible rash. I went to a second dermatologist who was male and clearly uncomfortable looking at my genitals. He looked at me for about 2 seconds and gave me an antifungal cream and more yeast pills lol. I was at my wits end. I could barely do anything, I couldnt work out so I was gaining weight, I couldnt have sex, and showering made things horribly worse. I finally decided to go to a third dermatologist who honestly saved me. She was the first dermatologist to use a dermascope on my vulva (the microscope that derms use), and also checked my butt, elbows, head and fingers with it. She looked at me and said ‚ÄúYou so clearly have psoriosis on multiple parts of your body including your genitals. I am shocked nobody noticed this, I wish you had seen me 5 months ago‚Äù. I honestly burst into tears because it was so nice having someone actually take me seriously and not automatically assume I have a yeast infection or an STD. I explained psorious and autoimmune diseases run in my family and she figured out that one of my psychiatric medications can trigger psoriosis. She gave me a topical psoriosis cream and has told me to supplement with Vitamin D. I have already started to feel better and its only been a week. While ‚Äúcured‚Äù isnt the right word for my issues because psoriosis is a long term condition, it can get better with certain medications and lifestyle changes. All I have to say is, please please please advocate for yourself. I let the doctors walk all over me for 5 months even though I knew there was something off.

rxdnqm,Healthyhooha,1641472777.0,"Why the fuck do people become gynecologists if they're gonna judge you for seeking treatment? Some of these doctors are borderline incompetent too, it's infuriating. (Context: I live in a very conservative country.)

So I (21F) have had issues with my thyroid for  almost three years now and I was unmedicated for a good chunk of that time which took a huge toll on my body. 

I guess because my hormones are all out of whack, I've been chronically dry down there with low libido and diminished physical sensation, and my bartholin's glands have been partially blocked for over a year because the fluid is too viscous.

Not exactly A-OK. So I visit a gynecologist. Did she prescribe medication or order further blood tests? Nope. 

She asked me ""why do you care so much about being dry if you're unmarried?"" Apparently it's not a problem worth treating if I'm not actively in pain, because I'm an unmarried woman. My body is not functioning as it should and I want it fixed, is that not a good enough reason? 

Awkward moment aside she decides to do a physical examination anyway. Apparently there's ""absolutely nothing wrong with me"" and ""how would you (21F, unmarried) even *know* you're too dry?"" Because only married people get wet and experience sexual arousal, apparently. Unmarried women are just oblivious to their vagina's existence until marriage, don't you know? 

I'm not having any of this, so I explain that I've previously had a blocked (painless) bartholin's gland which I developed after my thyroid issues started, hoping that might elicit some helpful advice. She told me it's because I have pubic hair which must mean I'm unhygienic. That's about when I gave up.

I'm not even surprised. This isn't even uncommon behavior among gynecologists here. I'm sick of begging doctors to do their job.

I put a finger in my vagina and felt a weird lump on the side of my wall with the hair attached to it and had the horrible realization that it was somehow tangled up in there. Boyfriend felt around and agreed it felt concerning. I called the on call number for my gyn and they said I wouldn‚Äôt be able to be seen until Tuesday, otherwise I‚Äôd have to go to the ED. 

I went this morning and after a 5 hr wait, had a young male resident have a look and said it was wrapped around a piece of my vaginal tissue and cutting off the circulation. I should also mention that I work at this hospital so it‚Äôs especially mortifying that I had to go in for this. He looked at his attending and said there was no way he could get it but that the tissue was dark from circulation being cut off so they called OB. At this point I‚Äôm crying and freaking out.
OB came and they were super nice and felt confident they would get it out. After laying there with scissors and forceps in my vagina while hyperventilating and crying, the hair was unwound and removed. My guess is that the hair got in there when my boyfriend and I were having sex over the weekend and the in-out somehow wound it up in there. 

Truly crazy. The OB attending was an old guy who ‚Äúthinks‚Äù he‚Äôs seen this before but otherwise it was a new one for everyone. Just adding this to my list of all the possible things to worry about when having sex now.

A young girl cries on a cold stone floor. She shivers and seizes as the blood pools around her skirts. Her mother will find her next to a cup of pennyroyal. She is buried in the village churchyard under a shroud of shame. A young boy attends the funeral and sheds a single tear, then turns to find comfort in the arms of another girl.

A woman in her forties walks down dark stairs to a darker basement. She hopes this won‚Äôt take long; she has three children at home, waiting for their dinner. She learned of this place from a friend of a friend. Whispered under the roar of machines meant to break their backs and their will. Waiting for her is a cold metal table and a cold hearted man telling her to lie down. She will not make it home for dinner.

A new woman, nineteen, and on her own for the first time. There‚Äôs a party tonight, and she wants to look her best. The music is loud and the house is crowded. She doesn‚Äôt care that it smells like stale beer and sweat. There is a cute boy in the corner who offers her a drink. She thinks he‚Äôs nice and takes it from him. The next morning she doesn‚Äôt remember the boy, doesn‚Äôt know why she is waking up on a strange floor, why she smells of stale beer and sweat. Three weeks later she takes a test. It is not the kind you can study for but still she gets a positive result. She tries to tell someone. They ask her: What were you wearing? Were you drunk? She can‚Äôt remember. Is this her fault, she asks herself. She asks the doctor. He says yes. You must live with the consequences. Consequences. The word echoes through her body as she drags the knife across her flesh.

A woman, newly married, full of promise, lays in a hospital bed. She caresses the swell of her stomach, whispers loving words. The doctors enter, frowns on their faces, and she feels the dread begin to rise. They use big words that she has read in books, in the sections she tries to avoid. Her husband‚Äôs knuckles whiten against the bed rail. Options, they ask together. One doctor shakes his head. Her daughter will grow up without her mother.

Twelve faces judge a woman wearing orange. It doesn‚Äôt matter her age. They call her a murderer. They call her a whore. They say she had no right. The judge and the law agree. Her tears mean nothing. She should have thought of this before. When, she asks herself, was she supposed to think about the rest of her life? At the doctor‚Äôs office? On the drive out of state? When her lover said he didn‚Äôt care? Or when they laid down together as they had so many times before? When she chose a pill over a copper device?

Dear Seemingly Uneducated School Board,

Unfortunately the problem that female anatomy is an inconvenience to you and is not important enough to miss school has been brought to attention, so here are some scenarios that may help you understand why some girls don‚Äôt want to go to school during ‚Äúthat time of the month‚Äù. Imagine that for one week straight every month of the year blood *oozes* out of one of the most sensitive parts in your body, it sounds annoying right? Now on top of that imagine that as the blood *oozes* out you have uncontrollable emotional outbursts. Then, add on the pain of a neverending muscle cramp. Now for that entire week of blood, unexplainable emotions, and the never ending cramp inside your stomach whose pain is equal to a heart attack, not going to school is not an option because letting a child stay home for more than ten unexcused absences is illegal. 

A girl usually has her period once a month for seven days making that sixty-three days a school year that a girl is on her period and only **ten** of those she can stay home. So for sixty-three days you go to school miserable and in pain because you would rather the school didn‚Äôt call social services on your parents *just* because you were experiencing menstruation. Not all girls will even need more than one day at home, but those ‚Äúone days‚Äù add up.

Every woman's period is different. Some have a blood flow so heavy that they resort to wearing all black along with having a tampon up, a pad down, and wearing their ugliest pair of underwear just in case they get ruined. Others may just be fine wearing a panty liner. Some have pain, some have none, and some have serious medical conditions that make cramps so bad they can barely walk. So whoever it was (male or female) that came out and said, ‚Äúhey, it really doesn‚Äôt hurt that bad, girls don‚Äôt need to stay home for this‚Äù can shove it right up their ass unless they have experienced every girl's pain. 

I am writing this letter because, believe it or not, **I am a female**. I remember having my first period. It was in the middle of a volleyball game when I squatted down and all of the sudden a gush of hot, sticky blood soaked right into my spandex. I spent the night crying of embarrassment and in pain, but I would still have to show up to school the next day. 

Lucky for me, I got to spend my day in the ER because I experienced a very common side effect of menstruation: An **ovarian cyst**. 

A cyst is a little pouch sitting on your ovary that fills with liquid causing pain or discomfort. A ruptured cyst is explained to be more painful than appendicitis and child labor. According to Sergio Vignali, who is an OB/Gyn physician, ‚Äúmost women develop at least one cyst every month‚Äù. Some females don‚Äôt even realize they have them and their cysts go away with their period. It depends on the female if the cyst will burst or not, but unfortunately I developed four cysts that burst all in the same day. So, go back to where you're pretending that you're oozing blood, crying, and cramping, and now add on a ticking time bomb sitting on your ovary that may or may not go off any given moment.

  Do *you* still want to go to school?

Now that you have a very *small* understanding of females go through during ‚Äúthat time of the month,‚Äù hopefully you will reconsider your attendance protocols because no, parents aren't committing truancy by letting their daughter stay home. They are taking care of their child's physical and emotional needs. So, until you put a woman's anatomy inside you and feel what they feel, **don‚Äôt** minimize their pain, just let them have the damn day off.

g36lad,WomensHealth,1587144979.0,"Today I found out what the real role of a hymen is. I was listening to [this podcast](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/w3cszj31) on BBC sounds where two gynecologists were discussing issues related to women's reproductive systems, common myths, and harmful practices. Dr. Jen Gunter was asked about the hymen, and this is an excerpt from her response: 

*""The hymen exists to protect the infant vagina from urine and feces and dirt. Because right when you‚Äôre born, the vagina doesn‚Äôt have any estrogen and is incredibly vulnerable to irritants. As we start to walk and become continent of urine and feces, the hymen becomes pliable and takes on different shapes because we don‚Äôt need it anymore. So the hymen is the exact equivalent of baby teeth. It‚Äôs something that we needed developmentally for a small period of time, and then it‚Äôs discarded when we don‚Äôt need it anymore. It‚Äôs got different kinds of shapes and pliability, it‚Äôs in no way a reflection of virginity. That‚Äôs a social construct which is very harmful to women.""* 

I'm sharing this because it was the first time I had ever seen the explanation of the role of a hymen. Until now, I did not know what the role of a hymen was, I just thought it's just the tissue that exists. I knew it was unrelated to virginity, but I didn't know what it did, which I think is quite telling of the education we receive about the female reproductive system. I just wanted to share this information because I believe that it is very empowering to know your body.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/g36lad/psa_the_actual_role_of_a_hymen/,PSA: The actual role of a hymen,,544,44,1.0,Zanbakh

This happened two weeks ago.

It was a Thursday afternoon at work and my coworkers and I started to get a whiff of something... unsavory. This is not unusual because I work in the cancer center of a large hospital. As with any patient care role, you encounter a lot of smells that you didn't know even existed. And they can be bad.

This one was bad.

We wondered at first if it was a dead mouse, checking under desks and counters, or maybe the red biohazard bag hadn't been changed. We emptied all the trash cans and still the smell remained. It would come in wafts and seemed to follow us wherever we went.

That's when the usual ""oh God is it me?!"" fear kicked in. We smelled each other and checked our shoes but couldn't pinpoint the stench.

Around lunchtime I went to the employee lounge on the other side of the department, sat down, and had the sinking realization that that smell was definitely coming from me. Something was seriously wrong with my pussy and other people could *fucking smell it oh my god.*

I ran to the bathroom, dropped trou, and bent over to inspect my underwear. I had just finished my period a few days prior, so there was some brownish discharge, but that wasn't unusual. It did smell a little but it wasn't overpowering in that moment. I googled it (obviously) and found some info online about how sometimes discharge can be smelly at the end of your period. And mine have changed somewhat over the last year since I got an IUD so maybe that was it?

I anxiously completed the work day, my legs squeezed together whenever possible, and continued to help my coworkers search for a dead rat.

The worst moment was that at one point I moved my leg or something and a wave of the stink rose up like the Dark Mark. My coworker who was sitting by me actually stood up and moved. I wanted to die.

Friday went similarly except the smell was even worse. I was hoping it would magically disappear but no dice. Embarrassingly enough I actually threw away my underwear around 1pm (I had brought an extra) because the dried discharge smelled like actual death. I began to wonder if there was something going on here.

I made an appointment with planned parenthood for Monday evening and hoped it wasn't anything worse than a standard case of BV or something.

Over the weekend I warned my boyfriend of the chemical hazard brewing but we had sex anyways because we are trash. It was a horrible horrible decision ladies and gents. Afterwards his penis smelled god awful and my vagina felt like it was on fire. He gently assured me it was fine and didn't smell that bad but honestly the whole room reeked.

Monday I came equipped to work with a pack of pantyliners that I changed out every 45 minutes or so. The vagina goddesses were smiling upon me that day because this method worked and there was no noticeable smell that day.

Finally at long last I made it to my appointment and was anxiously waiting bare-bottomed under a paper sheet. The nurse had agreed that it seemed like a case of BV and some antibiotics would clear it right up.

The doctor came in and had me assume the position as we chatted about my symptoms. She was still talking as she inserted the speculum and stated to examine me but then stopped mid-sentence.

Slowly she closed her eyes, leaned back, and said ""Joyce, get the bag.""

I was thinking get the bag, GET THE BAG? FOR?!

And in that moment, she extracted the most disgusting tampon in the world from its horrible chamber. It's smell was instant and overpowering. I swear I heard it scream out as she tossed it in the biohazard bag.

I. Was. Mortified.

It must've been in there a week!! How could I forget a tampon?! How did my boyfriend not notice it?!

The doctor insisted it was actually pretty common and not to be embarrassed but holy shit.

o1dz3x,Healthyhooha,1623873675.0,"Hello from Vegas! I wanted to make a little update post because we finally have an answer and there's a lot that's happened since I made the original post.

If you recall, I had a very painful weeping ulcer on my vulva, along with some pelvic pain. I later noticed some yellow discharge. Everyone thought it was a Bartholin's Cyst until the gyno got a look at it and said he didn't know what it was but he wanted to test for herpes, the lab fucked up and tested it for covid, I was freaking out because the spot was healing and I didn't think I could get it retested.

So where are we now?

Well, about a day after I made the post, I requested a full panel of STI tests (including an HSV blood test, but my doctor said no to that one because of how unreliable they are). I spent a day out and about, and then woke up the next day in incredible pain. The spot was back and it was PISSED. I immediately requested to be seen again, somewhat hopeful that they could give the swab test another go. I saw a different (and, honestly nicer) gyno who swabbed me but also ordered the HSV blood test to corroborate the results. I got the blood drawn for some STI tests, and tried to get myself to pee in a cup for the rest of them. I am very bad at peeing on command so I ended up having to give up and go back TWICE to get anything to come out.

So, it's Monday morning, and my family and I are leaving for a little Vegas Father's Day trip in the afternoon. I am FINALLY able to pee in the cup to finish off all of the tests and as we head to Vegas, test results start coming in.

HIV? Negative
HepB? Negative
Syphilis? Negative
HSV-1 and HSV-2? Both negative from the swab (thank God)

Then, while sitting poolside I get a final notification, this one from the pee test, and announce probably too excitedly

""I HAVE CHLAMYDIA!""

So, here I am now, waiting to get my azithromycin prescription sent over to the CVS and getting another set up for my girlfriend, and through a few sitz baths the spot has healed up for real this time.

13g54iv,WomensHealth,1683946172.0,"Hi made a new account so I could do this anonymously. I know it's a dumb question but it bothers me a lot. Sorry for format, I'm on mobile.

When I was maybe 12 or younger I would do a regular yearly check up and during those exams my vagina would be examined. I never wanted to do that part of the exam but I had too. During the exams he would rub my clitoris until I was wet to ""see if it worked"" This was something that happened a few times and every time he did it I was extremely uncomfortable and felt dirty afterwards. After a few times I told my mom I would refuse to go to any future appointment until I could get a woman doctor. 

When I did get a doctor who was also a girl; I was never examined like that which made me confused.

It has bothered me a lot over the years especially when I was in college and my friends were getting pap smears and general wellness exams and I never heard of them going through that. 

Every time I would remember the experience I would just cry because it felt wrong. But maybe I'm overreacting . Please let me know your thoughts.

Edit 1: Sorry for a late response but thank you to everyone  for replying and being kind. I've been at work all day trying to make sure I don't look at my phone because I know I'll cry. Also to make sure there isn't any confusion I am very much an adult now, I got back pain and college loans!

1. I genuinely don't remember his name I know he has retired well over a decade now and I'm not even sure if he is alive. 

2. This also took place at a tribal clinic on my reservation that I am a member of so to be completely honest I genuinely believe nothing would ever happen to him. Other native/non native women I know/am related to that have been victims of sexual assault (not in a medical setting) never got justice. Also from my understanding it would be a state/federal issue as many tribes don't have the resources to prosecute and the cases are ever growing so many do get forgetton I'm sure.


3. I'm also scared to say something because I know IHS knew about Stanley Patrick Weber and they did nothing except move that doctor around to different tribal clinics.  I honestly don't think anything would happen. As much as I do want to say something. But you guys are right he probably has done this to others as well. I know my brothers got their physicals done by him as well and they had to do the whole turn your head and cough. My brothers never said anything to me about being uncomfortable by him. But I will try to look into reporting this and see if my brothers were hurt by him as well.

Therapy is something I definitely need. I struggle a lot with depression and anxiety; but I have gotten better control of my anxiety over the years which I'm proud of. I haven't had a panic attack in years. I did fear men when I was in middle/high school but I've gotten past it mostly. I also do avoid hospitals/clinics when possible and try to only interact with women when I have to go for an emergency.
I have a boyfriend who has been the only one I've opened to about this and he has been great at being supportive.

I can't think of anything else to say but thank you everyone for being kind and validating my gut feelings that this was actually wrong and not normal. This was always something I tried to brush aside but this always made me feel sick and made me cry when I would remember.

I told him I have really bad depression and anxiety and its been a rough couples years to where ive gone from 140 to 94 pounds. Everything was going fine until he walks in after ive undressed and on the table. He does not wash his hands he has a big cut on his hands and keeps fixing his face mask and proceds to pat the bottom of the table asking me to keep moving foward to his hands with no gloves on he is inches from my vagina. I ask him to please wash your hands and put gloves on.

He gets upset saying he washed his hands before coming in the room but if i need him to he can wash again. He washes them and comes back at me still no gloves on until i repeat over and over you need gloves. I feel like the procedure went on for longer than it should have and it hurt really bad. After wards he washes his hands and the nurse books it out of there to where its just us and im still undressed. he then sits maybe two feet away from me and starts going off about how I should trust my doctor and trust that he washed his hands in another room.

And asks how long ive been afraid of germs and been like this. I explain my germaphobia and my agoraphobias and this guy then says that's no way to live not really a point to livng. And then asks if I couldnt shake his hand then how is it I have a boyfriend and let him touch me? I'm like ughhh your a stranger. He then says i need therapy that most therapists use exposure theraphy and proceeds to rub his hand all over the lamp they use to see in the vagina better and says i bet you couldn't do this.

I know that most women on this app would know it was fake and probably a creepy man but I know there is young girls on this subreddit and I don‚Äôt want any poor girl falling for this. I assume because I included that I was 19 in my post that they thought I would fall for it. It makes me sick that their are people out there who do this, please stay safe! 

The account was grouchy_quiet_1934 but they will most likely have changed the account name by now I‚Äôm guessing :(

EDIT: IT HAPPENED AGAIN I just checked my dm‚Äôs and it happened again omg. I saw an account had sent me a dm and accepted because I thought it might be a women who had seen this post wanting to talk about it. They had sent multiple messages which were this:

hi
i have the same issue
my vaginal area is too much itchy and rashes over  labia burning like hell
antifungals not working in this case
hello

The accounts reddit username cuckoo1991. I looked at the account because these messages were clearly fake and they literally have made posts about infertility because of their sperm count, and have multiple posts where they mention they‚Äôre a male. What‚Äôs even worse is in the infertility post I saw him mention he‚Äôs 31 which is so gross, I don‚Äôt know if he was trying to solicit pictures or anything because I immediately reported and blocked him but it‚Äôs gross enough that he pretended to have the same problem. 

I‚Äôm just in disbelief that it happened again especially after I‚Äôve made this post which anyone can see on my profile, and the fact it was so obvious when you clicked his profile that it was a man, he literally had a question about sperm count. Anyways I reported the messages this time! And blocked him so hopefully reddit will take action. 

Thank you all for the advice and comments! I hope nobody gets manipulated by either of these sick men :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/po7pkn/be_careful_on_this_subreddit/,Be careful on this subreddit!,Support/Personal Experience ,441,27,0.99,charlieee000

ejjjc4,Healthyhooha,1578076462.0,"hi! my name is Rebecca and i am currently in the midst of my first UTI. i have no clue how i got it, think it might‚Äôve been from using the same preparation h wipe in the front that i had already wiped in the back.

anyway, i had the uti for a whole ass month before i realized something was wrong. i had sorta been forcing myself to pee, it didn‚Äôt just come out. that was a month ago.

i started getting light pains in my sides when i was using the bathroom. didn‚Äôt think much of it. i was busy, under a lot of stress with finals and the health of my sick cat, and just thought it would go away.

i started a new job, with easy restroom access. my coworker, who is a family friend, asked me if everything was okay when i went to the rest room multiple times in one hour. blew it off like everything was fine, because i didn‚Äôt know.

around three weeks ago, whenever i urinated, it was blurry. meh, maybe i should incorporate more water in my diet. maybe i ate something weird. not insanely alarming to me.

about a week and a half ago, i would urinate, and instantly cringe from the stench. it was putrid, disgusting, yuck! thought it was something i ate.

on monday night, at 2am, i decided to take a UTI test strip. maybe this was my issue! i drank some water, had to go 25 minutes later. took the test, and boom! both sides of the strip were dark purple in less than a minute. oops.

good thing i took it when i did, i woke up tuesday morning, worst pain i have felt in a while. my kidneys were killing me. i set up a doctors appointment for thursday, since they couldn‚Äôt get me in that day. a few hours later, i decided i couldn‚Äôt wait. 

‚Äúwould you be mad at me if i asked to go to urgent care?‚Äù is what i asked my mom, she said no, then off i went.

the time passes, they checked my urine sample, the doctor walks in, ‚Äúyou have an extremely severe infection.‚Äù she also told me that i would‚Äôve been in the hospital by thursday if i didn‚Äôt go to urgent care. i would‚Äôve lost kidney function or even died from sepsis by next week. 

got a nice shot in the bum, got some antibiotics.

what i‚Äôm trying to say is, please know the signs of a uti and don‚Äôt blow them off because you‚Äôre busy. i could‚Äôve been in the hospital for new years if i didn‚Äôt go to urgent care that day. i‚Äôll keep everyone updated about how i‚Äôm doing!! i got stronger antibiotics yesterday and my cultures aren‚Äôt back yet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/ejjjc4/it_took_me_18_years_to_get_my_first_uti_and_i_was/,"it took me 18 years to get my first uti and i was dumb and didn‚Äôt recognize the symptoms, and now my kidneys might be permanently damaged or dead.",,416,41,0.99,rebbiestef

I had very large labia minora, particularly on one side, that would chafe no matter what underwear I wore. I also had to pull them aside during penetrative sex because they would get ""pulled in"", tug, and hurt.

It has been 1 year since my labiaplasty and my life has improved immensely. The surgeon did nothing to my clitoral hood; it was all just reduction of the labia minora. All-in cost was $4400 (surgeon fee, anesthesia, hospital fee, medications). I took 5 days off work and had sex 3 weeks post-surgery with no pain or issues.

The surgeon didn't berate me at all for my age even tho other women I've told say it wasn't worth it since my labia will change when (if) I have kids. I live in the DC area and the surgeon said most of his patients are cyclists who get a labiaplasty because of the chafing. Not sure what else to say now other than it worked for me, I have not regretted my labiaplasty, and I am extremely pleased with the results.

Ladies- vaginas have a natural scent. It doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad or that something is wrong. 

I worry because I see so many posts talking about the way things smell and I‚Äôm not convinced that it‚Äôs always bad. Everything gets labeled BV. And that‚Äôs a legitimately common thing. 

But. BV and yeast have distinct smells. Just because you smell ‚Äúsomething‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre having an issue. 

BV is fishy. If you smell fishy (and it‚Äôs distinct) then it‚Äôs cause for concern. Yeast (not always but sometimes) actually can smell like baking bread. Yeast is often more discernible by the consistency of your discharge and by itching and burning. BV and feel that way too, but the discharge is different. It‚Äôs often more watery. 

I‚Äôm just saying it because it‚Äôs a good reminder that vaginas don‚Äôt smell like nothing, nor should they smell like roses. Everyone has a different scent. So please take this into account before you post worried about things and get ‚Äúdiagnosed‚Äù with something you may or may not have. 

I‚Äôm a healthcare worker and I‚Äôve seen vaginas. Smelled vaginas, though not intentionally. When something is actually wrong, it‚Äôs noticeably wrong. 

Just a PSA to remind us all that vaginas can have a scent and it‚Äôs not always indicative of something being wrong.

ujdet1,WomensHealth,1651804184.0,"The title pretty much sums up this post. This is just a jumbled rant because I just need to vent to other women. I‚Äôm sorry in advance if it‚Äôs not cohesive! So many emotions!! 

I (26f) am pregnant - confirmed by 4 home pregnancy tests and a recent doctor‚Äôs visit. I am married to my wonderful husband, we both are college educated, and financially capable. I know this is a hot topic.. I feel like opinions are thrown in my face whether I‚Äôm on Twitter, FB, instagram, etc. I am not only reminded of my reality when I‚Äôm wasting time on social media, but also when my body randomly decides to become nauseated or so tired that I can‚Äôt hold my eyes open. 

I am unable to share the difficulty and heartache of this circumstance with either of our families (pro-lifers) - our support system is sh*t when it comes to this topic. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here, rambling incoherently. It was never our goal to have kids (mind you we have been sexually active going on 5 years with ZERO pregnancy scares). Now, here we are! There were reasons to believe my husband was infertile; however, I assure you precautions were taken nonetheless to prevent this, but again, here we are! 

As crazy as this sounds, part of me wishes I had a reason to not carry this baby other than not wanting one for my own. I feel immense guilt, and honestly, I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I do! I cry as I type this. I‚Äôm scared of what‚Äôs to come tomorrow, I‚Äôm scared this guilt is going to be carried with me for life, but I know (and have felt this my whole life) that I don‚Äôt want to be a mom. 

If you‚Äôve read this far, I sincerely thank you for listening to me. I love my husband dearly and he supports me 110% in everything, but I feel like I just need to get this off my chest to other women. Why? I have no idea! I‚Äôm a freakin emotional mess!! I just need to hear words of encouragement, support, or anything from other women who have gone through this or who know someone who has faced this. It‚Äôs not a decision made lightly. Truly, this is the most gut wrenching thing I‚Äôve ever endured. 

Thank you for listening ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT: Finally, I have figured out how to edit a post on Reddit!!!

I wanted to take a week or so before I edited this post to share how I am doing for those who have reached out and asked. 

Like I said, it has now been a week since I took the first pill and it has been six days since I inserted the remaining 4 pills vaginally. I am thinking about sharing my experience in a separate (more detailed post) in the hopes of possibly helping other women who might be going through the emotions of pregnancy and abortion. I don‚Äôt know how much help I would be, but maybe it would also be some help in my healing journey as well? Just some random thoughts! 

Anyways, I want to THANK each of you who have supported me in one of the most vulnerable times in my life. I never knew how kind strangers of the internet could be, but I am so grateful that I had you all to uplift me, listen to me, and make me feel supported when I TRULY felt like I was a monster in my own skin. 

I am happy to say that I am doing better. After taking the first pill, I did feel relief. I won‚Äôt lie, I cried a lot both Friday and Saturday (and still do cry now - it‚Äôs way less often) but at the end of the day, I am happy of my choice and would choose abortion if I had to do this over again. I have learned that crying and sadness does not have a correlation to regret in my instance. I have no regrets. In fact, my emotions and feelings are just all over the fucking place because *insert hormone overload*! Also, my husband is the best (I know I‚Äôm biased), but he was with me every step of the way, and I can‚Äôt thank him enough for just being supportive in any way possible. He also told off the protestors outside of the clinic, but that‚Äôs a whole other story lol. 

I‚Äôll end with this thought:
I am so damn happy that there are individuals (like you all) out here supporting women and their CHOICE and truly coming to me in a place of love and empathy - not judgment or hatred. I walk away from this rollercoaster event in my life both empowered and proud that I got to make this choice for myself!

n7nuxp,WomensHealth,1620475621.0,"I hope anyone considering medical 
abortion or who has experienced an abortion complication finds this article and it helps you in some way...

I was 30, sober, happy, healthy. I was told by doctors at 19 I'd never naturally have children so had not taken or used any form of birth control in that 11 year period. During my divorce, I got pregnant the very first time I had sex with a new partner. So I was legally married but separated from husband and now dealing with a lifelong decision that I had never prepared for or wanted to prepare for. I had fully planned on never having children as natural pregnancy wasnt possible right? Wrong.

At 7 weeks pregnant I was miserable. I suddenly hated all tastes foods smells drinks perfumes sounds lights noises. I hated everything. I hated myself.  I wanted to die. I was suicidal. I developed oral and vaginal thrush and it still hasnt gone away 8 months later even after 3 treatments and trust me when I say I have tried every vitamin supplement herb spice natural remedy medication etc you can name.

I finally decided not to proceed with the pregnancy and the moment I made the Planned Parenthood (PP) appointment I felt relief. It took 10 minutes on the website and 5 days later I drove myself there terrified and alone. 

The office was unfriendly, quiet, awkward, uncomfortable, unprofessional. The nurses and doctors were cold and distant. I saw my ultrasound one more time, cried softly and said to my belly ""I am so sorry I couldn't be stronger for you.""

A nurse asked me some questions. Tried to prescribe me pain meds I just told her I was allergic to. Luckily I caught it and refused the prescription. A ""doctor"" walked in wearing a polo shirt and said ""take this pill now and another tonight at 12am. Follow these directions if you have questions."" I asked if there were ANY RISKS OF COMPLICATIONS I SHOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT. The doctor said I was more likely to die from birth and walked out.

I took the first pill and drove 2 hours home. Took the second at 12am as instructed and by 4am ....it was like a demonic presence had entered the room. The pain was so intense I was hallucinating, sweating, moaning, shaking, gagging. It was the worst pain I had ever experienced and it did not stop for hours. I finally got in a hot bath for an hour (as suggested by PP website) and finally passed out at 6am. Slept til 4pm. Woke up with an appetite and a little sore but no biggie. Felt better already.

Until 5 days later. Excessive clotting and bleeding. Bled through my pants 3x in one day when I had never done that once before. My blood starting to smell rotten like fish and metal. Long thick strings were coming out with the blood which I later learned was just coagulated infection. I called the PP triage line and they said it was pretty normal.  

By day 7 I could barely walk, sit or stand and eventually developed a fever of 103. I was shaking uncontrollablly but managed to drive myself to ER.

The nurses immediately start insisting that ""you MUST have an STD."" Because the only known causes for PID and Septic Shock after a medical abortion is 4 forms of bacteria in the vagina or an incomplete abortion. All my blood tests and urine and ultrasounds came back completely normal and negative. I am literally a 2% statistic and cannot find any further research as to why this happened. Neither can doctors. 

So they pump me full of life saving antibiotics which did in fact save my life. They had given me 3 day life expectancy if the antibiotics didnt work but they did. Great right? Well...

The antibiotics were so strong it caused a series of other infections and complications they cannot diagnose or treat. I was back in the hospital again 6 months later with ulcerative colitis. I still have thrush growing in my body. I have lost 15lbs (down to 95lbs today) and am literally skin and bones. Malnourished. Weak. Doctors do not know wtf caused this and clearly how tf to help me. 

So every day now I wake up and advocate for my own health. I read, research, diet, exercise. I question my prescription medications. I question doctors knowledge and abilities. I question everything. Because if we dont question them who will? The FDA doesnt. The CDC doesnt. I am the only reliable advocate for my mind body and health. 

I wanna hear how you advocated for your health before during or after abortion or pregnancy. What did you learn? What would you change? How did this affect your beliefs and views.

jkdzwh,Healthyhooha,1603991147.0,"This happened a few months ago while I was trying to get a diagnosis for an obscure issue, but every time I think about it I get pissed off all over again. 

I was experiencing recurring fissuring of the perineum despite going months without sex with my boyfriend (he was studying abroad), and she was the first provider I saw for the issue. At the time of this appointment, I didn't know I was actually fissuring, I just thought I was chafed because I was experiencing intense burning upon penetration. After doing an exam, she said everything looked completely normal (later, another provider showed me the exact source of my pain), so I asked her why I could be experiencing such intense pain. She mentioned the possibility that I might have vulvodynia, but I explicitly told her that I have bled a little bit after sex, so vulvodynia seems unlikely since there was a clear cause of the pain (the blood isn't just coming from nowhere). She insisted I wasn't torn (again, she was proven wrong later), so I began suggesting possible causes for the burning since my initial thought was shot down.

I mentioned the possibility of dryness; I explained that I never felt that I am dry during sex, but I don't know what being dry feels like. Her response? 

""*Even if you are, then so what?""* 

Strike number 1.

I explained that I was simply trying to identify a cause, to then hopefully try to self-treat and prevent the pain from happening again. I then asked if hormonal fluctuations cause dryness and/or pain, and she gave me a definitive ""no,"" that my specific pill would actually cause me to be wetter (she never explained why). I find it personally unnerving when doctors refuse to admit that a drug can cause side effects, even rare ones, because weird stuff happens to random people. It's unfair to categorically declare that something cannot possibly cause a side effect, unless there is very conclusive science behind the claim. She rounded it off with the insensitive, sexist comment in the title of this post, with a scoff and a dismissive shake of the head. 

""Women love to blame everything on their hormones."" 

I'm sure you see why I was pissed and refuse to see this provider in the future. Firstly, I was just trying to suggest causes to figure out how to help myself, but she seemed to be threatened by this. I am not an abrasive person, and people often regard me as kind and friendly, so I know I wasn't coming off as rude. Secondly, the obvious sexism in the comment, coming from ANOTHER WOMAN. As if men and society at large don't blame testosterone for men's behavior?! Up to and including violent crimes?! She acted as if hormones are a uniquely female narrative. Also, maybe we consider hormones to be the culprit for a lot of things because THEY JUST ARE. Our moodiness before our periods, bleeding gums at random times of the month, and other seemingly unrelated physical symptoms can all be ATTRIBUTED TO HORMONES. Overall, she was dismissive of my issue (and turned out to be wrong!), dismissive of the female gender, and dismissive of science. 

I've warned all my friends to avoid this provider at all costs (I'm a student at a university, this provider works at our health center).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/jkdzwh/a_female_practitioner_said_to_me_women_love_to/,"A (female) practitioner said to me, ""women love to blame everything on their hormones.""",Rant ü§¨,362,30,0.99,meem_queen

She performed an ultrasound to see what was wrong and discovered a 10.5 cm cyst in my left ovary. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. We scheduled surgery for the following week and meanwhile she prescribed meds to control the pain I went in for originally. 

A few days go by and I notice some spotting in my underwear. I check and it was an ingrown hair that had popped, soon after that, the pain went away completely! Of course I still went ahead with the surgery and now I am recovering and grateful I went for a check up ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π.

I‚Äôm 24, Asian and a virgin. I have never had any sexual encounters with anyone - not even a kiss. No one has ever seen me naked apart from when I had my nappy changed as a kid. I‚Äôve had interest from men before but my vagina is holding me back. As soon as I was 11 (hit puberty), I started to get clusters of bumps, which have a white head. I thought I had a STD from sitting on a toilet seat (lol) but after research as a kid I later realised they are fordyce spots.

The thing is, I‚Äôve never ever seen a case as severe as mine. I‚Äôve seen every photo on the internet and read every post on Reddit about this but I have huge clusters of white spots( like over 100+) over my labia, clitoris hood, Anus, everywhere down there / it‚Äôs all covered!!! (which is very dark, so it‚Äôs VERY visible). Just imagine acne everywhere down there. It‚Äôs also VERY wrinkly. I can‚Äôt even look at my own vagina because it looks so bad. I‚Äôve literally contemplated ending my life over this.

I really want to go to the doctors but the thought of it drives me into a panic attack. I‚Äôve never spoken about this to my mum as talking about vaginal health is a very awkward and taboo topic in the Asian culture. I‚Äôve only mentioned it to my friends who said it‚Äôs ‚Äòrazor bumps‚Äô (which is literally impossible as hair cannot grow where my spots are) which made me even more embarsssed. I just nodded and agreed. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm looking for by posting this.. I want to go see someone about it, I‚Äôm just feeling so helpless and embarrassed. I‚Äôm very insecure that my hooha looks like this and is wrinkly üò≠

1agckf8,Healthyhooha,1706798558.0,"I've struggled with chronic UTIs for a decade, and do you know what it took to finally overcome it? Leaving Canada.

Let me begin by acknowledging the shortage of healthcare workers and their Hardwork, even if they are stretched thin and burning out. Hopefully, conditions will improve for them to receive the recognition they truly deserve.

My journey began in Kazakhstan when I experienced the usual burning sensation. Initially, I thought I'd resort to my usual routine of getting antibiotics to save my ruined vacation. However, my in-laws insisted on taking me directly to a urologist, something that felt impossible back in Canada. My family doctor, when I had one, never really warmed up to the idea of referring me.

In Kazakhstan, the urologist started with a cystoscopy (uncomfortable but not painful), blood tests, and swabs. To my surprise, testing for Ureaplasma and Mycoplasma was routine here.

The results revealed chronic UTIs and a positive diagnosis for Ureaplasma. The prescribed solution included 10 days of bladder irrigation (not as awful as it sounds, surprisingly, with iodine in the mixture), 5 days of doxycycline, and a bunch of probiotics to restore my flora.

I can‚Äôt believe it took me a year to get diagnosed with this. My quality of life was being severely affected with constant pain. It felt like I had gotten a tattoo on my clitoris, and every time I peed it burned like hell. Sex had been incredibly painful too, and I kept getting yeast infections, so bad to the point where my urethra was so irritated I was occasionally peeing blood. 

My gynecologists ran so many tests, and I still had intense pain after everything came back clear, except for an abnormal pap smear, which they told me to come back in a YEAR. They prescribed me a steroid ointment and a numbing gel, which didn‚Äôt help. It got to the point where I almost went to the ER because the pain was so bad it just hurt to be alive. 

I knew something was still wrong with my body, so I ordered an STD test from LetsGetChecked.com, which also tests for Ureaplasma & Mycoplasma, which is what I was starting to suspect. A few days later, they call me, tell me I have Gardnerella, and I was able to get prescribed medication and have it in my hands that same day. 

I was prescribed the antibiotic Metronidazole for 7 days, and the medication started to work so quickly. My pain was cut down in half 2 days later. It‚Äôs now day 7 and I am feeling amazing down there. I forgot what it was like to not have chronic pain, or pee without it burning. 

Doctors don‚Äôt usually test for Gardnerella because it is a bacteria found in healthy women, but an overgrowth of this bacteria can cause severe pain. I was worried that it was an STI from a partner, but only people with vaginas can be affected by this bacteria.

Every year about 30% of us will have bacterial vaginosis (BV), a condition in which the vaginal microbiome is out of whack. BV isn't just embarrassing, it's actually also implicated in increased risk of HIV acquisition, tubal infertility and even preterm birth. But the science about vaginal microbiomes, and how to fix them when they're no longer carrying out their protective role, is super out of date - and sometimes just plain wrong. This is ridiculous. It's the 21st century and there's still no good characterisation of the most common women's health issue. It's why I set up The Juno Study, the world's largest IRB approved study for decoding the vaginal microbiome. We launched the study on September 13th 2019. For every one of the 1000 women that joins us on our mission, by submitting a vaginal swab - think q-tip - using our prepaid kit in the mail, we send back a free vaginal microbiome report as a thank you.

So for almost a year now, I‚Äôve struggled with excessive discharge. Like really excessive. I would soak up a pair of panties in just an hour some days. I went to like 5 gynecologist.

I did ultrasounds and everything. I was so confused.

But one day, I went to another gynecologist. I was so tired and I was expecting the same answer ‚Äúnothing wrong you are good‚Äù. But he took me seriously. He listened to me. He was not stressed and I told him how hard this was for me. That I don‚Äôt understand, that I‚Äôve been to so many doctors.

Nothing has worked. Multiple rounds of antibiotics. Azo. Cranberry extract. D mannose. Chugging water till I literally feel like I‚Äôm going to throw up.  Even prophylactic nitrofurantoin. the last uti I got almost got me sent to the ER. And after this he put his foot down and said he‚Äôs not having sex with me until I get better. 

but what if I don‚Äôt get better? It‚Äôs been a year of this. And no doctor, gynaecologist, urologist, nurse or any healthcare professional has taken it seriously. 

Last night, I came out of the bathroom after being hunched over in pain for two hours, before caving and taking two Advil liquid gels (the amount I take for the UTIs is probably way too much and bad for my liver). I laid with him and started crying. Then he started crying. I think we both realized that there‚Äôs a looming expiration date to an otherwise perfect relationship. 

He admitted he didn‚Äôt think he could be in a sexless relationship and then we just cried for hours because neither of us knows how to fix it. I feel like he is going to give up on me and I‚Äôll be all alonstill dealing with this :(

I can‚Äôt keep antibiotics forever. I feel like doctors don‚Äôt have a solution for me. I have another appointment with the urologist in august and I feel like he‚Äôs just going to be like ‚Äúthere‚Äôs nothing I can do for you‚Äù and that‚Äôll be it

Edit: first I want to thank all the helpful suggestions. I really appreciate it. I‚Äôm going to ask for a different urologist (preferably female) at my appointment today, in addition to all the tests that were suggested. 

Secondly, I urge the people who are commenting on my relationship to please keep their thoughts to themselves. He has been there for me every step of the way. He‚Äôs left work to pick me up and bring me home/doctor when I have symptoms, he‚Äôs come to doctors appointments, taken all the tests I‚Äôve asked him to, we‚Äôve developed a really strict routine pre and post sex. He gets my meds for me, feeds me when I feel ill, and will sit with me in the bathroom until 2-3 in the morning to make sure I‚Äôm ok. 
The people saying that he is ‚Äúusing me‚Äù are completely out of line. Anyone with a chronic illness that affects their sex life will tell you how much of a toll it takes on your relationship. he does not want to hurt me anymore, so he has said that we should stop having sex for a while. The problem is, no doctor has been able to help me long term, so we don‚Äôt know how long a ‚Äúwhile‚Äù is. This has been happening for 8 months. Is it fair to ask him lol to be celibate for almost a year when there is no solution in sight? No I don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking that of him.

Thinkx is under scrutiny for having per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances aka PFA‚Äôs in their products, even though they advertise their products as ‚Äúnon-toxic, organic, and environmentally safe.‚Äù These PFA‚Äôs are toxic chemicals that are apparently quite commonly found in non-stick cookware as well as water repellent goods. Thinkx products contained very very high amounts of these chemicals, which are known to cause cancer and reproductive harm. 

I figured this group would be a good place to share some links and information for others who are users of period underwear, so you can choose the safest, non toxic products for yourself.

orr4cx,Healthyhooha,1627272577.0,"I wanted to share my story of having a vaginal tumor. I searched so many different subs for anyone who had an experience like mine, but I couldn't find anything that was similar to my experience. I read a lot of experiences with cancers, and those made me feel even worse while I waited for biopsy results. The beginning of my diagnosis was extremely lonely because I couldn't find any stories from others online who had symptoms like mine. 

I was misdiagnosed with vaginismus last year (October 2020). My symptoms started as pain with sex (only on the left side) and progressed to unprovoked electric shock shooting pain from left side of clitoris down to left side of vagina. I eventually developed pain with bending over, running, doing stairs, and unprovoked stinging at the site of my tumor.

I did pelvic floor PT for seven months with minimal success. I stopped progressing in PT after a few months. Eventually, a provider sent me for a pelvic MRI in June. The MRI showed that I had a lesion in my vagina exactly where all my pain was occurring. I had actually palpated this mass back in April, but I was told it was a trigger point in the muscle. I'm really not sure how this was missed during the TWELVE pelvic exams I had had since seeking treatment for my pain with sex. The impression on the radiology report suggested aggressive angiomyxoma. I was referred to see a gyn oncologist and saw her the day after my MRI. They told me they didn't know what this was and mentioned possible malignancy. I underwent a biopsy about a week later. Waiting for results was absolutely agonizing. I read awful stories about people having vaginal cancers and undergoing radiation and vaginectomies while I waited for results. There was a lot of crying throughout this whole process. I finally heard back that my tumor was benign and thankfully not an aggressive angiomyxoma! There are zero reported cases in the literature of my tumor occurring in the vagina, so they're writing a case study about it.

I had surgery last week and am post-op day 3 now. My tumor was extremely low in my vagina that it could actually be palpated through the skin externally (wasn't visible externally tho). I was put under general anesthesia for surgery. Since my tumor was right up next to my urethra, I had to go home with a catheter. Which I'm going to have until Tuesday. My pain has been well controlled with Tylenol and ibuprofen for the most part. My pain post-op is so much better than my pain was before surgery. The catheter is honestly the worst part. My vulva is extremely swollen, and she is not pretty to look at. My clitoris is so bruised that it's black and blue. But I'm doing well and will hopefully be able to have pain free sex again in the future once I'm healed from surgery and given the all clear. 

I hope this helps someone else in the future going through gyn surgery or some sort of gyn issue benign or malignant.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/orr4cx/i_had_a_tumor_removed_from_my_vagina/,I had a tumor removed from my vagina!,,333,20,1.0,ellenthymelon

I was raised in a very frugal household. My routine is I would wake up, use a wet flannel to wipe my neck, chest and armpits, and then use some ¬£1 roll on deodorant. I would shower twice a week, shampoo my hair. That‚Äôs it. We never owned soap or body lotion, moisturisers or anything like that. I know nothing about these things, what I need or how to use them.

It has come to my attention that this is not the correct way of doing things ? And I would be really interested to learn how to do things properly / what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing, but I have no idea where to start ! I would love my skin and hair to be healthier (which falls under skincare and haircare I suppose, which are things I never thought about because I always considered them a luxury way out of my reach) and I would also love to not smell. My armpits (and by extension my shirts) smell and I‚Äôve always just been quietly embarrassed about that, thinking there was nothing I could do. 

Any guidance would be massively appreciated.

1) If you sleep with a pad, in order to not soil the bed by period blood running down the buttcrack when you sleep on your back, WEDGIE the pad between your buttcheeks. I do this before I go to bed, and it has become an automatic thing to check it quickly every time I change sleeping positions.


2) Use Ibuprofen or naproxen for cramps! Not paracetamol, it simply doesn't work as well and it has been proven. Also, the earlier you take it the less of a bad time you will have. Don't wait until the cramps are really bad, take it just when you feel the cramps starting (if you know you can get bad cramps). Overnight I take it proactively bc I know I will wake up in severe pain otherwise..you don't wake up from the pain until it's quite bad (This is for ""normal"" cramps. If you think you could have endometriosis, please try to get professional advice)

3) Pee after sex! Yes, as soon as possible after. All types of sex. Don't wait too long.

After an exceptionally vigorous sexy time, I passed out and forgot to go pee. I honestly was exhausted and figured, meh one time, no big deal. ( hindsight 20/20 ... this was not a good idea). I woke up later, cleaned up and carried on with life. 


A few days later I felt itchy. I thought at first I had a yeast infection but quickly realized ( after my 8th trip to pee in 2 hours) that it appeared I had a UTI. Shit. This was around 10/1. I called my doctor and we did a televisit. I described symptoms, how long I‚Äôd had them and he agreed , Yep, sounds like UTI. He was going to call in an antibiotic and some diflucan. Awesome- also this is a new antibiotic. I‚Äôm allergic to penicillin and erythromycin so I‚Äôm leery about any antibiotics but this, this was a 1 dose deal! Monurol. 

So I wait. Check my app as it always notifies me when any rx‚Äôs are ready. Nothing. It‚Äôs now after 6 and the dr office is closed. My bladder is spasming like crazy and no damn prescription. I‚Äôm miserable. I try a couple of OTC things and just suffer until the next morning.

That‚Äôd be great- thanks 

By the way- that one shot antibiotic? WITH INSURANCE was $70.... ffs 
But I got, I took it and waited.
Kinda felt better. This was Friday. Sunday and I was like great this over!!! 

Then Tuesday happened. From the time I woke up at 6 to noon, my UTI came back with a vengeance. I ended up in the ER and had a Ct scan because my back was hurting so bad. Multiple IV pain meds, antibiotics and confirmation that my UTI was not cleared up ( duh) I was sent home on new meds and told to feel better. 

Fast forward one week. I‚Äôd been having some low back pain which I attributed to my shitty work chair. Until Thursday afternoon. I felt bad. Achy, hot and nauseous. I left work early and told my boyfriend I was going to his house to crash. I barely made it there - on my way I started shivering so hard I could hardly hold the wheel. Got in his house and just crawled in bed. I was burning up. I knew it but couldn‚Äôt do anything or care. I was having a hard time breathing but figured it was because I was hot. I used my inhaler and laid down again. My boyfriend came home and took my temp- 102 ( normal for me is 97.3) I managed to get a call in to my dr again and had an appointment to see them first thing in the morning with the instructions if I got worse to go to the ER. 

I took various pain relievers and some Benadryl and tried to sleep. My fever would drop for a little while and then spike again. My back pain was worse and it was getting even more difficult to breathe. All I wanted to do was make it to 7. My kid needed a ride to work and then I was going to the dr. Dammit that‚Äôs all I was focused on. 

6 :30 I woke up and sat up. When the light hit my legs I realized something was wrong. I angled it better and scanned my whole leg starting at my ankle and sweeping up to my thigh. 

Hives. I was covered in hives. I lifted my shirt. My belly was covered in hives. My chest and arms. The inside of my mouth had them. I was allergic to this stupid antibiotic. 

I got myself dressed. Called and Told my child to find a way to work and drove myself to the ER. It was probably the shortest desk to triage to bed time I‚Äôve ever had. My reaction and subsequent infection was bad enough to get me admitted to the hospital for 3 days for IV antibiotics.

k46g5r,Healthyhooha,1606773830.0,"Hello everyone,

I would like to submit this post as a bit of warning to any women here who have begun taking wellbutrin/bupropion.

After taking Lexapro for about 3-4 months early this year and experiencing a crazy drop in libido and weight gain, my doctor switched my to wellbutrin about 6 months ago.

At first everything was fine (I thought). My libido returned and was able to lose weight which was awesome. About a month or so in, I started experiencing what I believed at the time to be an insane  yeast infection: My symptoms were crazy itchiness, redness, swollen labia, painful sex, fissures (tiny cuts around vagina from dryness), and pain/irritation near the opening of my vagina. These symptoms seemed to be recurring, I'd have a few days of relief and then the issue would come back. Sex was IMPOSSIBLE. After rounds of medication for this ""yeast infection"" and no relief, I went to the doctor and had myself tested for all STDs and came back negative. Feeling defeated, I kept trying to mitigate the symptoms with other treatments (sitz baths, etc). I went to the doctor again months later after STILL no relief, and was diagnosed with cytolytic vaginosis, which has no real cure. I was also told that I couldn't have unprotected sex with my boyfriend (lol...excuse me?) because the issue was his semen was irritating me ....completely out of nowhere! Looking back, the doctors really were as baffled as I was.

It was about 6 months of hell. Severe pain, not knowing why, and not knowing how to stop it. Whatever improvements I got by switching from lexapro and getting my libido back were ruined again by this new set of vaginal problems that also made sex impossible and began to impact my mental health and relationship as well.

About 2 months ago, my partner and I were doing process of elimination to try to think about what has changed this year for me to find a root cause. The only thing we could think of was switching to wellbutrin. I did a LOT of research and vaginal irritation and swelling were rarely listed as side effects, and if it was listed, it was wayyyyy at the bottom of the ""rare"" list. So I wasn't fully convinced, but we had no other leads, plus the timeline did kind of line up with when the issues started. So I took a few days break from the wellbutrin just to see what would happen.

Within 4 days, all of my symptoms were gone. I could not believe it.

I scheduled a meeting with my psych and told him about what had been going on and he immediately said ""let's take another 2 week break and see if the issue stays away"". So I did. Symptoms never returned. Since then I have stopped wellbutrin completely (I was on 300 mg I believe), and I am happy to report that I am better than ever. No more pain or irritation, I can have a normal, spontaneous sex life with my partner without the anxiety of the whole thing hurting! I can pee without it burning! It has had a stronger mental health improvement than the medication ever did. About a month ago I went to have a new doctor re-test me for cytolytic vaginosis as I was diagnosed before, and the doctor found nothing and that I was/am perfectly healthy. I feel that way too now.

I'm writing this here because when I was 65 chrome tabs deep into my research and in the throws of pain, I could barely find anyone sharing a similar experience or drawing this connection. If any woman reading this is on this wellbutrin/bupropion and experiencing severe vaginal issues, seemingly out of nowhere, it could very well be this medication!

EDIT: I wrote this post a year ago and still get DOZENS of messages about this. I am so glad it‚Äôs been helpful and I hope women continue to find it and get the relief they need (if this applies to them). Always discuss with your psych before discontinuing your medication.

So I went to see a gynecologist as soon as I could, and though he thought it was a Bartholin's Gland Cyst when I described it, once he got down there he said he actually wasn't sure what was going on. So he swabbed it to be tested for herpes. This scared the shit out of me, but I stayed strong and vowed to not panic until I saw the results. He sent me home with a course of acyclovir just in case and some topical lidocaine to relieve the pain. 

I got an email later that night saying I had test results available, and when I went to check, all I had was a negative COVID test. I did not take a COVID test.

So the past few days I had been calling the office and talking to a whole assortment of people trying to figure out what happened, and the whole time the bump is healing nicely and I'm in way less pain because of the lidocaine.

This morning I got a call saying that apparently the lab had mislabeled my swab and tested my vagina for covid instead of herpes! And, now that the spot was healed over, they couldn't retest it!

So now I don't know if the spot healed because of the acyclovir or just went away on its own, I still don't have a definitive reason why it happened in the first place, and I have no idea what to tell my girlfriend.

I guess I just want to know where to go from here? I also have some photos of the spot at its worst vs how it looks now, if anyone is interested in getting a look at it themselves.

Edit: I'm currently in talks with my doctor about getting the HSV blood test as well as blood and urine tests for other STIs. I'll try to keep yall updated. Also, it should be worth mentioning that the last direct sexual contact I had was in January (with a man). I've had a girlfriend since mid-March but we haven't had any oral-genital or genital-genital contact.

ju5bi3,Healthyhooha,1605373869.0,"I've been having symptoms for two days and it was really bad this morning. Did the AZO stick test and it came up with very positive (we're taking magenta/purple) for leukocytes and negative/trace for nitrites. Meaning there was inflammation but no signs of a classic E. coli caused UTI.

I asked a couple friends for opinions bc this is my first time feeling this way. They laughed when I said I was going to my doctor. They said it would go away on it's own with drinking a lot of water and cranberry juice.

I went to the dr. today and my urine sample I gave showed moderate levels of leukocytes, no nitrites, some blood, and some bacteria present. So I'm now taking antibiotics because even though *some* bacteria were present, the UTI could start up again from the same infection and could be even more severe.

Sure, many people can have UTIs go away on their own. But there is always a chance it could spread to infect the kidneys and/or cause septicemia. There is also a chance it could be an STI (all negatives for me). The point is, go see a doctor.

**tl;dr: take calcium and vitamin d for menstrual symptoms**

I was never one to really get PMS symptoms. Maybe a little breast tenderness and soft stools on the first day, cramping on the first day but nothing Advil couldnt fix. Consistent, predictable periods

Last year my body went completely haywire. I don't even know how to begin explaining to you how sick I felt, like clockwork at ovulation, my body and my mind completely fell apart. It felt like no system was left untouched. I felt so bad I truly genuinely thought I was dying for months

All of the symptoms I experienced (many were just related to a vitamin deficiency and not my menstrual cycle specifically)

* gallbladder problems
* kidney problems
* heartburn, stomach acid washing back into my lungs
* chronic, random hives
* allergic reactions to things I had never reacted to before
* fevers
* diarrhea, sometimes 15x a day during ovulation
* constipation
* extreme loss of appetite. nausea/vomiting/gagging upon putting anything in my mouth
* muscle weakness and this really gross general body sensation I can only describe as 'puke colored and gooey'
* insane, out-of-control, burning up jet fuel kind of anxiety. beyond anything ive experienced before and ive lived with anxiety and anxiety attacks for years
* jet fueled insomnia
* extreme fatigue
* hallucinations
* vision problems, worse visual snow and sometimes feeling like I was processing my visual field like it was a simulation or something
* feeling like my eyes were bugging out of my head
* rapid accelerations or deceleration in BPM
* postural hypotension
* a burning sensation all over my body/neuropathy
* all kinds of different rashes
* blood pooling in my extremities when standing
* fainting
* headaches
* sudden, severe mood swings. feeling ok one minute and within minutes sinking into the deepest, most suicidal, hopeless depression I've ever experienced
* irregular periods
* periods that were lighter/thinner than normal but stretched over a longer period of time
* PAINFUL AWFUL cramps. like sweating, fetal position, cant get off the bathroom floor all week cramps
* chronic pelvic and low back pain
* a sensation of growing pains in my bones that I've actually had since I was 17 but no doctor knew anything about. but during this whole thing I realized they also happen around ovulation

It took a few months but I started to realize certain, and the most severe, symptoms occurred at ovulation, and a bit into the luteal phase but they seemed to level out some before my period. During ovulation I felt like my body was burning up jet fuel and then after I crashed and just felt really tired, weak and sluggish for a few days.

I saw a family doctor, 2 gastroenterologists, countless urgent care docs, a cardiologist, and finally, when I realized my symptoms were cyclical, 2 endocrinologists.

The first endocrinologists ran a bunch of tests and basically just found I was really low in vitamin D. 'Whatever' I thought ""Everyone's deficient in vitamin D'. So she gave me some mega doses of vitamin D for 2 weeks and then a maintenance dose. I felt better so, so quickly. Even symptoms I had for years but didn't think were necessarily linked, like the pelvic pain and bone pain and hives/new allergies, went away. My mental health, which I've struggled with since I was 12 when I saw my first therapist, has improved dramatically.

I could not believe that the most sick I've felt in my life was due to a single nutritional deficiency. At my follow up I tried to ask for an explanation; about the connections between vitamin D and the menstrual cycle, and my doctor didn't really know, she just knew a lack of vitamin D could make you feel really bad.

That wasn't good enough for me. I hated that no doctor could really tell me *why* I was going to hell and back every month so I wasn't feeling confident it couldn't happen again. I started doing my own research (which, tbh, I'm very good at. I'm a recovering hypochondriac and my doctors who know me well often encourage me to consider med school. It's hard for me to praise myself, but I am good at this stuff.) Basically I found some, but not a ton, of research basically linking vitamin D, calcium, the parathyroid glands and the menstrual cycle. I didn't know if the relative lack of research was just because the science was still in its infancy, if the medical community just doesn't care about women's issues enough, or if it was bad science.

But in all of these papers I check the authors and if they're still working. One of them luckily, is working and coincidentally, was also in a hospital system I was previously a part of (Mount Sinai). I scheduled an appointment with her and I'm so glad I did. She was the first doctor who could finally, *finally* tell me what was going on with my body because PMS is what she's spent her career studying.

We all know calcium and estrogen are linked right? We know post menopausal women are at increased risk for osteoporosis. We also know women who experienced PMS/PMDD are more likely to have osteoporosis. Why? Estrogen helps the body absorb calcium. We also know vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption. Without enough vitamin D, your body can't get enough calcium. After a long time without vitamin D, your body will start leeching calcium from your bones in an effort to maintain homeostasis. Calcium isn't just an essential nutrient for bones, it's also an electrolyte. Electrolytes regulate nerve and muscle function as well as balance water and acid.

During ovulation when estrogen peaks, the parathyroid glands along with estrogen leech calcium from the bones because they body isn't able to get it anywhere else, causing bone weakening and a sudden surge in calcium in the blood stream in a condition called hypercaleceima. Though hypercalecemia caused by vitamin d deficiency are usually less severe than hypercalecemia caused by parathyroid tumors. When estrogen drops, so too does calcium in the bloodstream, leading to hypocalecemia

Electrolyte imbalances are serious; my mom almost died from one. At a low level they're not critical, but they're going to make you feel sick -- possibly monthly. If the nerves in all of your organs aren't being regulated properly by proper electrolyte balance, of course that's going to cause some issues. Further, dysregulated muscles and nerves are going to cause PAIN, including more painful cramps then necessary

Again, it's amazing to me that the most sick I've felt could be so easily cured with some supplements. But calcium isn't just a mineral, its an electrolyte. And vitamin d isn't really a vitamin (since we can make it ourselves), it's a pre-hormone and acts more like a steroid in the body. Neither me or my doctor know why my symptoms got so severe all of a sudden, but we think COVID probably had a hand in that. I also was taking omeprazole, a strong antacid, for a few months when I was first having my GI symptoms. With less stomach acid, my body was less able to break down food and get the necessary nutrients out of it, so I was exasperating my problem further.

Again, I know this is long but I hope the few of you that read the whole thing feel empowered to take control of your menstrual cycle; that you don't have to suffer this way every month. I can confidently say, at least for me, I am no longer experiencing any of the symptoms above. And they were resolved so so quickly. I've also been taking vitamin B12 and a B complex vitamin. Which brings me to my other point; **this probably isn't going to be a solution for you if you're not deficient in these vitamins.** But if you live in an industrialized country, if you have darker skin, if you wear sunscreen religiously, or if you don't go outside much, there's a good chance youre deficient in D. And if you don't really eat meat, and aren't diligent about replacing meat-specific nutrients, you're probably low in B12.

Ok, I'm getting off my soap box. I just really, really don't want anyone to have to suffer like I did especially when the solution is so easy, but also easily missed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/ln5slr/those_who_suffer_from_pms_pmdd_and_dysmenorrhea/,"those who suffer from PMS, PMDD and dysmenorrhea: READ THIS",,327,85,0.99,throwra05059

He was so amazing. He made sure we could get to clean bathrooms every few hours (I use a menstrual cup and it needs frequent changing on day one and two). I made us late a couple of times because of how long I needed in there, and he was patient and so chill about it. He also filled up my hot water bottle, and made me my raspberry leaf tea in the morning. Lots more, but those are the highlights.

The first day we met (March 2020), we talked about periods and birth control and natural birth delivery. Not sure how we got on those topics. Partially because I'm a health coach, but mostly because we were so comfortable talking to each other. I fell halfway in love with him the first day.

I am so open with him about my periods. Sometimes I ask that we put an important conversation on hold because I know I'm PMSing and emotional. Other times, he's changed plans for us because of the timing with my cycle.

It is even more special to me because I never had this growing up. I was raised in a family and culture where periods should be kept secret. I had such difficulty because I never understood what was happening to me and I couldn't discuss things openly. Even my mother was embarassed to talk about it, and got really upset at me when I started using tampons, and then later the cup.

md80u3,WomensHealth,1616705260.0,"Hi, everyone. I'm that girl that made a series of posts starting with being afraid that her ovaries were dead and leading into a battle with ovarian cancer (and sh*tty genes).

So...we had to struggle a bit to get me the scans I needed to see if the treatments were enough. It seems that my insurance company refused to acknowledge any type of scan as medically necessary, and didn't want to cover it at first.

Because of course checking to see whether or not a cancer patient still has a fast-growing cancer is unnecessary, right? That makes perfect sense.

My Oncologist was confused and called it completely ridiculous at how firm they were being about it, especially since I couldn't start my preventative treatment until I was deemed in remission, and they need scans to deem me in remission. However, after a few weeks we got approval for a CT scan. I got to learn that the texture of the barium smoothies is the main turnoff point (not the taste).

However, there was a bit of an issue with the IV. It appears that my last good arm-vein of the time decided to blow mid-scan...they tried to get me closer to my hands, but it was no use. In the end, we had to wait and see if the oral contrast was enough to get perfect imaging.

I went to see my oncologist this Tuesday, and I found out that they were clear enough and I am officially in remission! I know the doctors all said that my chances of death were really low, but the full weight of it hit me like a freight train; I'm going to live!!! 

I'm so happy...for the first time in months, I can sit here and not worry about cancer. My eyebrows are already back; very thin, but growing every day! My hair is slowly growing and its so soft now! Its almost to the point where my scalp is invisible. My eyelashes are starting to grow out. 

Now there is one more obstacle left; I need to go back and get the hysterectomy finished. My uterus and remaining ovary are apparently a big risk now, so...I can't keep them for very long. If my SO and I were in a position to have kids, we would consider holding off long enough to do that but we are years away from that, and we can't afford to wait that long. I hate it, but it is for the best... 

The doctor ordered Parp Inhibitors in hopes that they could help me in the long run with my er...sh*tty gene problem. The big issue is that these are pretty expensive...I will need to navigate juggling keeping my medical insurance with finding gainful employment because I can't afford the parp inhibitors 
out-of-pocket. A single month looks to be thousands of dollars, and I need them for 2 years. It is my hope that the BRCA1 mutation will be better controlled with these, however. 

Bottom line, I am free! I am getting to the point where I can figure out how to get back on track, and I am so, so happy! Tomorrow I will also be getting myself vaccinated for Covid; I spoke to my oncologist about it and I qualify for phase 1b in my state due to my body still recovering from the chemotherapy. I have already survived one Big C...I plan to take every step possible to make sure I don't have to deal with with the other.

EDIT: I forgot to mention this...we found my mother's cause of death.

It turned out to be Toxic Shock Syndrome...she had a laparoscopic procedure done a couple of weeks after my own surgery, and...it seems this was a belated complication. We were shocked; apparently it is incredibly rare to have a complication like that occur so long afterwards. It usually only happens within a a couple of weeks of the procedure. It had been so long since her procedure with no signs of it that when the symptoms hit, everybody assumed it was food poisoning...we can only hope that she was asleep when the worst of it hit, but...I know it wasn't a peaceful way to go.

As the title says, HPV has ruined my life. It has affected my work, my finances, my mental and physical well-being, and my relationship with my husband. 

Quick backstory, I was diagnosed with HPV last summer for the first time at 32. Never had an abnormal pap. It has been 3.5 years since my previous pap so I was only 6 months or so past when I should have had one. I had been having on and off post intercourse bleeding that prompted me to go. The HPV was a huge shock. I‚Äôve only been with my husband. However, we had split up the year before for nearly a year and he had a partner during that time. Who knows when I got HPV but throwing that in there. 

Pap was normal for cell changes. Doc said come back in a year. Didn‚Äôt feel right so I asked for colposcopy. She did one and said she saw nothing to biopsy and come back in a year. Still didn‚Äôt feel right. Got a second opinion and he said my cervix lit up with cell changes in one large spot. Ended up with CIN 2 (precancer level 2 out of 3). Was spiraling during this time. Ended up being diagnosed with illness anxiety disorder and even residual PTSD from this. New doctor said not to worry, LEEP would fix it and I‚Äôd be fine. 

Doc does LEEP and during discovers a spot of vaginal dysplasia (VAIN). VAIN is incredibly rare at around .02 per 100,000 and most of that very small amount is 60 or over. I‚Äôm early 30s. Shocked yet? I sure was. 

Doctor was super casual, biopsy confirmed grade 1 VAIN, doc said he removed it via excision because he was already in there. 

I wanted to know my strain so paid extra to rule out 16/18/45 because those cause the majority of HPV cancers by a long shot. Negative for those strains.  Went ahead and did anal test even though I didn‚Äôt think I would have it because I‚Äôve never had anal intercourse. Guess what? Positive anally too. Now I have to get a test done to check for anal dysplasia. 

I‚Äôve been having random bouts of dryness, itching, burning. My vulva simply looks unhealthy. Now I‚Äôm worried I could have vulvar dysplasia from HPV too. I can rarely have sex with my husband anymore.  I‚Äôll be checking more into that at my next check up in March. 

I have my 6 month check up in 2 months and they will test if I‚Äôve cleared the HPV and will also check to be sure no cell changes have recurred. Around 60 percent of people clear HPV at 6 months after LEEP.  I have no confidence it will be cleared due to having shit luck so far and the fact the infection is confirmed to be in 3 places. It is ravaging my body. 

I‚Äôm spending HUNDREDS a month in supplements, vitamins, etc to try to clear this. 

Why is my body not doing it‚Äôs job? Why is it in so many places? Why am I having so many issues without even having the worst stains? 

Most importantly, WHY didn‚Äôt my gynecologists EVER offer the vaccines? NEVER. I was having PAPS to check for cervical cancer but never offered the vaccine for the thing that causes virtually all cervical cancers. I feel FAILED. It‚Äôs suggested up to 26. 

Please please please get your children vaccinated for HPV. Boys and girls. They all need it.

If you are in your 20s, get it. Even if you have had a strain of it, you likely haven‚Äôt had all of them and this will protect you from the others. 

They even changed it to where it‚Äôs good for even up to 45. 

Yes, this is an EXTREMELY common infection. 80 percent of people will have it at some point. 90 percent will clear without an issue. There is NO reason to be in the 10 percent like me who didn‚Äôt clear and now have life changing issues when there is a vaccine to practically take the chance of it away. 

I‚Äôm not here to cause panic. I‚Äôm here to share why it‚Äôs so important and God knows I wish I had someone telling me how important it truly is. 

I truly hope that in another 20 or how many ever years that high risk HPV infection is unheard of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/19aqf9b/hpv_has_ruined_my_life/,HPV has ruined my life.,,312,131,0.96,Ok-Training-9414
zh91lo,Healthyhooha,1670620717.0,"I have posted here before looking for answer to why I kept having papercut like tears constantly on my vulva and around my vagina....and

OH MY GOD! I  just got done with an appointment with a new Gynecologist today. I just finished crying in my car on my whole commute to work. Why? Because I FINALLY know why I have had vulvar atrophy (tearing) for the last freaking 4 YEARS. I was biopsied, did blood work, pap smears, STD testing, ect. Nothing came back with an answer as my estrogen levels were fine, bloodwork was good, and everything was negative on my tests! I was in pain, my sex life was non-existent due to tearing fears, I was getting angry and depressed, damn, I couldn‚Äôt even wipe without getting a tear! It has been brutal. I walked in slightly hopeful, but still expecting to be disappointed. I had done my research and I was almost positive by this point that the issue was being caused by my birth control but my other doctors did not think so.

I get in and talk with the doctor and I tell her that I don‚Äôt want to undermine her or any of my doctors but I 110% think it is my birth control causing I but that my doctors do not agree. She takes a moment looking at my chart and then asks me if I know how birth control works. I think it is weird, but I answer her what I have always been told. It stops ovulation and thickens uterine lining to keep the sperm from being able to fertilize an egg. She said yes but then also explained about hormones and how they work and confirmed it for me: ‚ÄúYour low dose birth control is messing up your estrogen causing the skin to be thin and delicate. Almost like a woman in menopause.‚Äù That is what I have read and come to in all of my research in my time and none of my other doctors thought it was possible, BUT IT WAS AND IT IS. I was so relieved the more she told me about it and explained it and I was like omg‚Ä¶. She said that the low dose is terrible and she tries to never put her patients on that and prefers other methods that she feels are better and don‚Äôt mess with the estrogen and progestogen levels as much. The birth control I have been on for over 9 years, Lo loestrinfe, she said yes it low dose and she does not like that pill specifically. She understands why I was put on it as any other doses of estrogen/progesterone in birth control made me severely homicidal or severely feeling like un-alieving myself. She herself, does not prescribe and tries everything she can to not prescribe it unless it is a last ditch effort. Basically, it was only giving me back 10mg of estrogen and the normal amount is 30mg or so?  Forgive me for doing my best to try and regurgitate everything she said. It was hours ago and crying then going into work has my brain scrambled.

SO ANYWAY, my body was basically getting deprived of estrogen causing the skin to thin and making my body feel like it was in menopause on my vulvar skin. I was literally about to cry like OMG I KNEW IT WAS SOMETHING WITH MY BIRTH CONTROL!!! THEN she also told me that the clobetasol cream/ointment (I used both) that I had been told to use for the last year and a half was making the issue WORSE! I had also tried Estrogen cream but I was only put on it for 2 weeks, which she said it might have helped but I needed to be on it MUCH longer than that. She did not want to give me more pills and offered an IUD as a solution as I do not want kids but also, due to my autoimmune disease, I would have an extremely high risk pregnancy. I want to get sterilized but my insurance will not cover the procedure I want and they are unable to deem it as medically necessary unless I have past medical history, but even then they would need to remove my ovaries too. The doctor was a little hesitant about that part (removing ovaries), but preferred a bislap over tubal ligation due to risks (ectopic pregnancy and ovarian cancer). But my stupid insurance will cover ligation but not the other. She agreed with me when I mentioned Texas does not care about women.

I also just really want to put this in there because I appreciate it and loved this appointment. She did not shame or try to talk to me into having kids. No ‚Äúbingo‚Äùing as we say in my child-free group. She was 100% supportive of my choice in wanting to be child-free and sterilized. Not only that, she also noted that my stress could be contributing to my issues and asked if I saw a therapist. I said I did years ago for my extreme anxiety and depression until I could no longer afford it. My therapist was great and she armed me with the tools to help continue my recovery journey. She said that it must have been and is really hard for me being so young and dealing with not one, but two autoimmune diseases on top of all this issues with my vulva, as well as any other stressors in my life. I don‚Äôt know, but that just really hit me right in the heart that she was so empathetic about it and as genuinely concerned for my physical, emotional, and mental health. It has been hard with my autoimmune diseases as well as my vulva issues, and to have someone else see and acknowledge that and care just meant so much to me. Literally bawled to my boyfriend the whole drive to work (25 minutes lol). He thought that the doctor was mean to me or something LOL.
 
So yeah, I FINALLY have an answer and I implore you, all of you, who have had this issue or dealing with this issue. NEVER stop fighting for an answer, you don‚Äôt have to suffer. I truly hope every one of you that has this issue, a similar issues, or another issue all together, find someone: a nurse practitioner, a doctor, any qualified medical specialist who will listen to you and do what this doctor did for me. I am so eternally grateful that I finally have an answer and am now working on a solution.

 

TLDR: My low dose birth control has been causing my tearing by depriving my body of estrogen causing the skin to be very thin and fragile. She was kind and did not bingo me for not wanting children and offered solutions. She also explained in depth why birth control was the issue and solutions and what they all are and what might work best for me. She also laid out a treatment plan for me and showed empathy for my autoimmune disease struggles.

Thanks for reading.


***EDIT UPDATE****

So I got a Kyleena IUD placed because I don't ever want to be pregnant and because my periods suck without BC. I got it placed in Feb. 2023, and I am happy to report I have not had tearing since maybe Sept./Oct. 2023!!! It was still noticeable for awhile after I got my IUD but it gradually slowed down and stopped. Tearing now only occurs if I am extremely rough or am wiping so much that my vulva is super dry and irritated. I did get a super back yeast infection combined with I think they said BV(?) a few weeks after my IUD insertion. It was terrible but I used witch hazel wipes during that time and god it felt like heaven. It really helped soothe the area. After that I have not had any tears so I don't know if that was a blessing in disguise.

So I am happy to report my tearing was caused my hormone imbalance from my low dose BC depriving me of estrogen. My estrogen levels showed up normal on tests but was the issue all alone. I got a Kyleena IUD. After a few months and a terrible yeast infection and BV at the same time, I no longer have had any tears since then. 

I hope each and everyone of you that comes across my post with the same issue are able to find a solution!

mmiiev,Healthyhooha,1617850737.0,"I'll start this by saying I quite like Tiktok for how fun it is and how catered the feed is. However, I got SO heated watching a seemingly young woman touting the advantages of vaginal ""moisturizing"" flavored(!!) suppositories. I haven't seen any gynecologists debunking them yet, and I tried looking for the ingredients on their **ETSY** shop but since they went viral the company is in the process of moving to their own platform. Multiple people said they have coconut oil in them, which isn't *necessarily* bad in itself, but I'm highly suspicious of whatever flavoring agents are in there. The video's creator specifically said the peach flavor was her boyfriend's favorite. I saw some people saying stevia was in them. So many of the comments were people asking whether they'd get BV/UTIs/yeast infections from using them, and the creator often responded saying they were perfectly safe! I immediately thought of y'all and this sub, because this is some of the best crowd-sourced vaginal health info on the web.

I find content like this so infuriating because:

1) a lot of the viewers are impressionable young people who are easily influenced by hype

2) there is no fact-checking or scientific basis for any of this product's claims, plus it was being sold on Etsy of all places

3) this seems to prey on patriarchal notions of how gross vaginas are and that they need to be altered for sex/oral sex to be enjoyable (specifically for men)

4) unless they were explicitly for lubrication, the vagina does not need to be moisturized; those aren't the same thing imo

This is very concerning because products going viral on Tiktok have definite real-world ramifications and it happens very quickly. Has anyone else seen this video?

14enie2,Healthyhooha,1687295804.0,"TLDR; Years of excessive yellow smelly discharge, constant moisture down south. Most of the moisture was actually sweat, which caused my healthy bacteria to overgrow, hence the excess discharge. Using antiperspirant wipes in my area groin cured me!

&#x200B;

So,

I've had excessive, yellow, smelly discharge for going on 4 years, and just constant uncomfortable moisture in my groin. Every test just kept coming back normal. Antibiotics used to work to get rid of it, but it would always come back after my period. 

I've been to multiple gynecologists over the years, done a bunch of Juno Bio tests, and tried everything, but nothing helped. (UNTIL NOW THAT IS :D)

&#x200B;

For some reason, I had thought the excessive moisture in my groin was from the excess discharge. I eventually discovered it's actually my excessive sweat levels, which makes sense since I have hyperhidrosis in pretty much every other part of my body lol. I'm talking dripping, immediately after my showers, 24/7.

I finally had enough of the sweat, and went to a dermatologist, who gave me ultra strong antiperspirant wipes to use on my groin. I figured if I was going to have the stupid discharge forever, at least the rest of the area could be dry lol.

Now, usually after I get my period, the blood just turns into the profuse yellow glop that I constantly had to deal with. When I used these wipes though, I did get the yellow discharge for about five days after my period, BUT GUYS, at about that fifth day mark, it slowly faded to a clear, regular amount of discharge. 

So by day 5 after my period now, it's just normal levels of clear, non-smelly, normal discharge!!! (and when I say normal, I mean my normal that I had before all this started. I know everyone's 'normal' might be different). It probably just takes a few days now for my vagina to get back to the normal flora after a period.

I switched to different antiperspirant wipes since I didn't like the dermatologist ones, but I'm happy to say, this has been working for two periods now, so I think I finally found my cure!

Now is it safe to be using antiperspirants in the groin? I have no idea. But even if it isn't, this is such a major quality of life improvement for me, it's a tradeoff I'm willing to make. The wipes the dermatologist gave me were Qbrexza, and the ones I use now are the Duradry ones for hands and feet.

&#x200B;

So I dug out the ol' reddit account to post this here, just in case someone out there might be having the same problem as me. I know how much it sucks, so hopefully this helps someone <3

I told her I was tired of how much this affects my daily life, and she said ‚Äúthere isn‚Äôt necessarily something wrong just because it‚Äôs an inconvenience to you‚Äù. I had to keep myself from crying during the appointment because I was so frustrated with the lack of acknowledgment for my issues. I‚Äôve done my fair share of research, and I suspect that I have endometriosis (but of course, it could be some issue as simple as hormone irregularities) I‚Äôm changing doctors as soon as my new insurance kicks in. 

Every doctor I‚Äôve gone to for this issue has either been condescending or impatient with my reason for coming in, like I‚Äôm a waste of their time. It makes me feel irrational. It makes me feel like I‚Äôm being overly dramatic or I‚Äôm exaggerating my issues. I just want one doctor to say ‚Äúyes, I hear you, let‚Äôs get you tested and rule out any possible causes for these issues‚Äù. And after that, if my symptoms really are just my normal, then I‚Äôll accept that. I‚Äôm just sick of not knowing whether there is actually something wrong with me or not.

Anyway, who else is sick and tired of this shit?

1axd8uu,Healthyhooha,1708625452.0,"Hey everyone,

this is a throwaway account as I am super confused, hurt and embarrassed by all this. Sorry if it is long but I am still reeling.

I recently found out I was pregnant and went to my OBGyn who I hadn't seen in many years (used to see one closer to work but she closed down a while ago so I went back to the doc I saw from 2004-2010ish). This man has been great in the past and supported me through an abortion when I was 17, I had zero reasons to doubt his medical expertise. He is very friendly and professional.

So yesterday he did my first ultra sound, confirmed my pregnancy (which had me cry in the chair as I watched my kid's heart beat) and then tells me that I have an infection down there that needs to be treated with antibiotics. No biggie so far.

Then he proceeds to ask me how exclusive hubby and I are. I tell him we've been together for a decade and very exclusive, and he tells me that the infection I have is sexually transmittable and in 99% of cases through sex. Like, it's extremely unlikely he or I picked it up elsewhere. He asks me if I ever cheated. I stare at him in disbelief and say no, then tell him that I really, really don't think hubby would cheat on me. 

He tells me to go home and confront him. Literally said ""Look him in the eye, if he's lying he won't be able to hold eye contact"". Then tells me he's sure we can work it out and to bring him to the next checkup next week. Asks me to tell hubby he needs to pick up antibiotics for himself at his own GP. I leave shellshocked.

Now, I confront hubby, we cry and argue, I think he cheated on me, he swears he didn't so he thinks I cheated on him. It's a whole mess. Through all that I don't even remember what the doc said I have, so I email the practice and ask. This morning they reply and tell me it's Gardnarella. I google it and nearly puke because it is NOT and STD??? And we fought over absolutely nothing on the day I brought home our first ultrasound pic.

Now I'm starting to question my sanity here. Can I go back to this doctor? Should I confront him? Should I confront him and then change docs? The OBGyn situation in my city is terrible, I've tried a bunch over the past years and they treat their patients like absolute crap. I am so confused why he said this, possibly blowing up my marriage while I'm 6 weeks pregnant over literally nothing??? 

I'm grateful for any input at this point. The internet tells me G. vag. is NOT an STD and is usually just an imbalance in the vagina. What would you guys do, or is there a better subreddit you could refer me to if this isn't the right place to ask?

The doctor asked if he could have another doctor view the procedure, I am not shy so I said yes. 

The thing is this made the whole thing last 3 times long at least and I wish I had said no. He walked her through a very rough examination. He inserted the inserter into my cervix as I coughed and left it in there as he pointed things out and explained things to the viewing doctor. I was struggling to breathe through the pain. I can take a quick pain but this was an unnecessary minute of leaving it in, it fucking hurt. I cried and the health care assistant holding my hand looked so uncomfortable like she knew it shouldn‚Äôt be like this. He did not take notice of my discomfort. The process itself turned me from a patient/person into a demonstration dummy. The way he spoke about me made me so uncomfortable in a really vulnerable time and I still find it upsetting to recall and I can recall it vividly. This was years ago and I don‚Äôt remember his name so I can‚Äôt complain. 

My partner wasn‚Äôt allowed to be the one holding my hand but said he could hear me being in pain on the other side of the curtain and said I was white as a sheet and shaking when I came out.

hfm02e,Healthyhooha,1593091376.0,"I have been living with my friend for a few months now, and I believe she has a vaginal infection. The smell goes beyond that familiar musk you might get after a workout; it is one of the worst things I have ever smelled, and permeates every inch of the house. The bathroom where her towel is and the couch are soaked in it, and it sticks around after she leaves. I no longer work out with her as the smell is overpowering. When she wears dresses, and sits with her legs open, it is unavoidable, but if she wears jeans it's less noticeable. It doesn't smell like any infection I have ever had, or like a yeast infection, and frankly, it is so violent, I wonder how she doesn't smell it herself.

Recently a guest for dinner took me aside and asked me how I wasn't smelling the rotting garbage smell. Until this point, I had blamed it on our close living quarters, and being sensitve, but now I am a) concerned she has an infection and b) worried people will talk about her or avoid her. 

She has never been sexually active, and is extremely body conscious to the point where I have never seen her, in 18 years, in less than shorts and a tee shirt. She doesn't like going to the doctor (I suggested getting a pap smear just for general health, but she won't go), and will only go if it's unavoidable. A mutual doctor friend once told her she was concerned my friend might have sleep apnea and my friend was so embarrassed, and angry, and called it an invasion of privacy. I  100% understand how not nice it will be to hear, so I'm looking for help from fellow hooha owners.

mvhysl,WomensHealth,1619018442.0,"I had surgery a few years ago and this still bothers me, so I need to ask for some outside opinions. Just some background; I'm a woman in my 20s who lives in Canada. The surgery was to correct a deviated septum and enlarged turbinates. I was told it went as planned, although I did have some problems with the results which I will get into later. These are the only two surgeries I have ever had.

&#x200B;

Given that I was having nasal surgery, with the exception of removing the leads from the machines they connect to your chest to monitor your heart rate and such I didn't expect they would have any reason to go below my neck. When I woke up everything was normal, obviously I had some pain but I was taken great care of by the nurses. I had to stay in the hospital overnight, and at one point I went to the bathroom and when I removed my underwear there was a creamy white substance in them. It was definitely not discharge. It reminded me a lot of what had come out before as remnants of a Canesten tablet I used when I had a yeast infection. I asked the nurse if she knew what it was or why it was happening. She said she would have to check and when she came back later she told me that when I got out of surgery but was still unconscious they put in a vaginal suppository to help reduce nausea when I woke up. I will never forget the look on her face when she said it, because it was kind of hushed and she didn't meet my eyes when she said it. I don't know if I am connecting things that aren't there but that makes me nervous. It has bothered me for the years since, but especially since I had a second surgery.

&#x200B;

After the original surgery I didn't recover well. I could barely breathe through my nose and was worse off than before, so I decided to have  a second surgery to correct it. I decided to see a different surgeon this time, so I got my referral and went to a different hospital in a different city. It was also a different district so they did not have immediate access to my original surgery's records. I had already put off that second surgery for three years and I was terrified going into it, not because of the surgery but because of what was on my underwear after the first one. I spoke to three different nurses (at original pre-op, a day-of one who sorted out my chart pre-surgery, and one who was actually in the surgery) and the anesthesiologist about my fears and told them that I absolutely did not want any suppositories of any kind during or after my surgery. I cried every time I had to explain it. They all seemed surprised when I told them what had happened, but one nurse was on the verge of tears with me and he told me he had never heard of that. He spoke with another nurse and they hadn't either. He said after that he doesn't think that should have ever happened and that I should get a copy of my medical records from the first surgery.

&#x200B;

I have thought about this all so much since. I'm so confused and upset by it. I wonder if I'm overreacting because I am a victim of sexual assault and haven't had any kind of sex other than that, so I know I'm very sensitive to these matters. Was what they did normal? Am I overreacting? If anyone can help me here, give me advice or relate your own story or anything I'd really appreciate it.

Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone who has commented. I have read all of your responses and although some opinions or suggestions have been scary to read, I feel a sense of comfort in knowing that I‚Äôm not overreacting. I truly appreciate everyone who has taken the time to respond, share their story, or offer comfort.

jbop8j,Healthyhooha,1602772544.0,"Hooha friends, we have a problem. 

I NEED all of you to follow the rules when posting photos. But it's become clear that we need to do more to filter out surprising posts of genitalia and body fluids. This place truly is about normalizing good feminine hygiene, but that doesn't mean we should subject one another unexpectedly to graphic photos. 

As soon as I post this I plan on messaging some mods from some other subs that have some automatic filters in place to help fix this problem. I want the users of this sub to be able to solicit non-medical-but-friendly feedback on their issues  That's what we've been about from the start. 

I do apologize that it's gotten this bad to each and every one of you who has ever browsed this sub, hoping to find an answer to a question you have about your own body. 

Much love, 

peachikeene

EDIT #1 - To clarify, we do still want to be able to have our users post images if they feel the need to. Thing is, more often than not, these photos are showing 1000% NORMAL vaginas/vulvas. I've looked at them. I want the community to be able to get the reassurance they need to know they are normal. 

But we also HAVE to have a way to automatically filter them to the mod queue for approval before publishing (this is my ideal plan, and that's what I'm actively working on), or at least to mark them automatically NSFW (as mentioned below, which I've learned is how r/badwomensanatomy does it). My goal is to keep rule-breaking posts off everyone's feed in the first place until we as mods can make sure they follow the rules. If we don't address it in this matter, we will continue to have surprise genitalia and/or discharge on our feeds because right now, all we can do is rely on the reporting feature and by then, it's already happened. 

I will update again once I get the AutoMod up and running. I have already been in contact with the r/badwomensanatomy mods as well as within the r/AutoMod community to get solutions. I'm onto an answer at this very moment, and then will probably run a few test posts to see if it works. 

Thanks everyone for your patience.

EDIT #2 - I may have found a fix. Anyone willing to help me test it? Please DM me first.

EDIT #3 - it‚Äôs somewhat fixed. Ran a few test posts last night, some got through, most didn‚Äôt. I will keep tinkering with it over the weekend and will update again. 

I‚Äôm so thankful for the help I‚Äôve received so far. I plan to shout out everyone who‚Äôs either helped me with the AutoMod code or helped run a few test posts. I‚Äôm gonna try to reach out to the posters of NSFW photos in the past few weeks or so to update them of the changes and give them the opportunity to repost as well. I appreciate all the comments of support here too. Thanks everyone.

HOPEFULLY FINAL EDIT - I think we've done it, friends. 

Huge thanks to all that helped test, both users and fellow mods alike; and huge thanks to our friends at badwomensanatomy and the AutoMod subreddit for helping me with the AutoMod coding. Any posts with any sort of photo link, either direct or from an image-hosting site, will be automatically removed with an AutoMod comment telling them about the rule. They will be asked to review the rules and resubmit. This *should* eliminate all photos period in the main feed, and the mods will be able to see them in our mod queue and can approve them if they are regular photos, like a funny meme or something. Always down for the occasional funny meme around here. 

I hope this is a better fix than the previous system. I really think it's going to work great. Thank you to this awesome community for bringing it to our attention and being patient while we work it out.

i8x4lm,WomensHealth,1597312671.0,"I‚Äôm only making this post to serve other women who have questions, and concerns. This was just my experience.

After a week of my period being late I took a First Response pregnancy test that turned positive almost immediately. After talking to the father (who wanted absolutely no part and insulted me) I decided the best choice for me was to proceed with an abortion. 

I made an appointment with Planned Parenthood for the following week. When I arrived at Planned Parenthood everyone treated me with kindness and I felt very safe. (For me that‚Äôs very important because of my anxiety). I told the lady at the desk that I did not want to be on my mothers insurance and wanted it completely confidential. It took less then half an hour to get into the exam room. And within that time they got me covered by medicade so my appointment was free. As an 18 year old girl in the middle of a pandemic with no financial support this meant the world to me. My appointment took less then 2 hours from my arrival. They explained everything to me in detail, and what I should/shouldn‚Äôt expect. While I was at the clinic I had to urinate in a cup, get my blood drawn, had an ultrasound using a long camera tool they insert into your vagina to find out how far along your pregnancy is. It‚Äôs not painful but it is uncomfortable. It only lasts a few minutes. If they don‚Äôt have your blood type on file, or if your blood type is negative you‚Äôll need to get a shot. The shot is usually administered at the back of your hip and it doesn‚Äôt hurt bad at all. Planned Parenthood gives you a packet with their numbers and all the health information you‚Äôll need regarding your abortion and afterwards. 

The medication abortion is made up of two steps. When you are at the clinic they will give you the first pill. This is the pill that stops the pregnancy from growing. I didn‚Äôt experience any side affects of this medicine besides a little bit of diarrhea and slight stomach discomfort. Nothing too bad though. The second set of pills are taken at home. You and your doctor can decide if you‚Äôd rather take them orally or vaginally. There are 4 pills that you need to take. I chose vaginally, it‚Äôs not difficult you just stick them up there and lay in bed for 30 minutes - 1 hour.

I would say the cramping started about 1 hour and 30 minutes after I used the pills. I took Tylenol 30 minutes before using the pills. I highly recommend using your pain medicines that your doctor suggested to you. (DON‚ÄôT USE ANY THAT MAY THIN YOUR BLOOD). The cramping is painful. On a scale of 1-10 I would say the pain is a 7. It feels almost like you constantly have to use the bathroom or poop. Not long after my cramping started I started to feel sick and nauseous. I did end up throwing up, but I felt a lot better after I did so. The cramping lasted for about 6 hours. I did start to get chills as well. 

Nausea, Vomiting, Chills, Fever, Dizziness, and Headaches are all a part of going through the abortion unfortunately. All of these things should subside within 24 hours, if not please call your doctor. 

In terms of pain management, set alarms every 4 hours to remind yourself to take more pain medicine. Keep a trash can next to you, and make it easy to get to the bathroom. Drink water, slowly sip on your water. Use a heating pad or warm water bottle to help ease your cramps. Use a cold cloth to put on your head. Nobody else knew I was going through this and I went through it by myself. Until my younger sister got home and she took care of me. Having somebody there with you helps with the pain. Your best option is to try and sleep through it the most you can. I took a couple of melatonin and smoked a bowl. I woke up at 2am but my cramps are gone for the most part and I‚Äôm feeling almost 100% better. 

Please spare any judgement this was just to help other women understand the pain that they may have to go through. It‚Äôs not something I ever want to experience again. I didn‚Äôt feel very emotional as some women may because I knew this was the right choice for me. So I highly suggest if you can have someone there with you. Tell them you have a stomach bug or something so they can at least support you. 

Hope this helps someone‚ù§Ô∏è",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/i8x4lm/6_week_medical_abortion/,6 Week Medical Abortion.,,289,20,0.98,yllek_anon

Try changing your body soap and laundry soap to unscented and gentle products. I know it sounds crazy but hear me out. 

It all started with a little itching in my vulva area. I was exercising a lot and I assumed this was the cause. Then my anal area became irritated. I went to the doctor, I was tested for STD‚Äôs, everything came back negative. They told me everything was fine, that it would probably clear up on it‚Äôs own. 

And it did. Kind of. The intense itching would go away but then it‚Äôd come back. My entire vaginal area would be extremely dry, burning and itching. I would scratch until it became red and irritated. Same with the anal area. Vagisil would take the itch away for a minute and would come right back. The only thing that helped was cold water sitz baths with colloidal oatmeal. Then I started getting pimples on my vulva area. I went to the doctor again. 

They tested me again for STDs. All negative. This time they gave me antibiotics for BV. The burning and itching went away. But came right back. The pimples would come and go. Went back to the doctor, was tested for yeast but I had normal levels. I decided to try a Mobistat kit anyways. No results. Went to the doctor again and was given another round antibiotics for BV Same thing. 

FINALLY a very kind nurse suggested that maybe I was sensitive my laundry detergent. She explained that laundry detergent has harsh chemicals that some people are sensitive to. Sensitivity can develop at any time in life. I thought she was crazy. At this point I had been dealing with the symptoms for close to two years. But I was desperate. So on the way home I bought some free and clear, washed everything with it and there has been no turning back. My vagina is happy. The itching and burning has completely stopped. I use dove unscented in the shower. The pimples went away.

I have been struggling with BV for the last few months as I‚Äôve been on constant antibiotics for other issues. I have never thought I had a smell. I take probiotics, use boric acid, etc just like my gynecologist tells me to. I cannot BELIEVE how insecure finding 3 memes about ‚Äúwhen you pull down her panties and it smells like fish‚Äù in his camera roll would make me.

 I grew up with little money and parents that would not buy me basic things like deodorant, body wash, etc. so as an adult I‚Äôve always been super ‚Äúanal‚Äù abt smelling good and overall hygiene. Having reoccurring BV is something I am SO insecure about. These memes in his camera roll were literally all from the one night he went down on me for the first time in months and I‚Äôve been internally breaking down every time he wants to have sex now. 

How do I tell him this hurts me? He knows I saw ‚Äúother photos/screenshots‚Äù of things but I haven‚Äôt brought up the ‚Äùstinky cooch‚Äù memes bc I know that‚Äôs the one thing that I am actually in control of when it comes to the weird shit in his camera roll.

I‚Äôd plaster this all over my personal social medias because I‚Äôve been living a life of hell for 2 years. I started having unprotected sex with my husband 2 years ago. Before then, we weren‚Äôt married and we‚Äôre doing our best to avoid pregnancy. It was all good for the first few months and then my vagina went out of wack. It smelled like I had a rotting animal inside of me 24/7. 

I was afraid to go out in public. To be close to people. It was very embarrassed. Luckily my husband is a sweetheart and never made me feel bad about it . I went to the doctor and I was told I had BV. Took Metronidazole and it did nothing. But they kept giving me Metronidazole. I stopped trusting my doctor and went to Reddit. I was told to try boric acid. It worked wonders temporarily. I was able to go to the gym confidently and have a sex life again. But if I stopped boric acid for even a day BOOM, rotting dead animal smell coming from my crotch. 

So then I kept looking on Reddit. Someone said I might have mycoplasma genitalium. I begged my doctor for a test. I didn‚Äôt have m. genitalium instead I had m. hominis & ureaplasma. Yet again my doctor prescribed Metronidazole. I requested doxycycline. Reluctantly she ordered doxycycline. Then I asked my husband to take it as well. We both did 14 days. No sex, taking doxycycline. Avoiding everything it said to avoid. Tons of pro & prebiotics. We both tested negative 1 ,3& 6 months after. I‚Äôve been so scared to do anything to make it come back. We‚Äôve been having unprotected sex because we‚Äôre trying for a baby. I really didn‚Äôt want pregnancy PLUS a swampy, stinky cat. 

Usually during sex my vagina would give up and just permeate the air with this rotten smell even if it was fine prior. But we‚Äôre 6 months post doxycycline and I smell like a normal vagina. last night my husband preformed oral sex on me for the first time in 2 years. I cried because despite the fact that he was willing to do it even though I smelled so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt let him. Last night I felt confident enough to let him go for it. And he told me I tasted like water.

I just had to share with someone. I never told anyone close to me of my struggles but this infection really destroyed my self esteem. I wouldn‚Äôt go to the pool or beach. I stopped going to the gym. I would take the stairs. Any activity that would involve sweating or my legs being open, I‚Äôd avoid.

ygl9d2,WomensHealth,1667054169.0,"Last Sunday morning I woke up and whilst laying in bed noticed my stomach was swollen and it felt hard. I worried momentarily then decided it must be constipation or trapped wind and got up, took some senekot and gave it no more thought. The following day it starts hurting, wasn't going down but I was starting a new job the next day and decided to ignore it again.  The following morning on the day of my job, I was getting my 3.5 year old ready but the pain was so much worse, I couldn't stand up straight even but I was still arguing with my partner that it would be fine and I had to get to my new job.  An hour later I gave in and went to A&E.  I went through triage (UK) and after that I could stand straight again so messaged my partner saying I'd come home still convinced it was probably just a bad case of trapped wind but the triage nurse said that was unlikely.  

After 3 different doctors poked and prodded me I was transferred to the surgical assessment unit, by now I had a canula in with IV fluids, I had given 3 lots of urine samples and when they asked me if I'd gained any weight recently I said what a lot of women apparently say 'I avoid weighing scales'. After a bladder scan the nurse said audibly 'my god', my bladder was apparently incredibly full which was odd as I'd just been and given a sample and had no problem.  They said I needed a catheter put in after a CT scan.  Went for the CT scan and went through the unpleasant experience of having a catheter put in.  

After another hour or so I was told I was being transferred to the gynaecology ward and would be staying overnight.  Thankfully my new job was very understanding that I hadn't made it to notnonly my first day but likely the following day, I still didn't know what was wrong.

After an unpleasant night's sleep with a catheter and still hooked up to an IV the doctors came to do their round and I found out what was wrong.  I have a 17cm ovarian cyst, the fluid they found on the bladder scan was in fact the fluid in the cyst.

I was released from hospital on the Thursday morning and am now awaiting a date for open surgery to remove the cyst and at least one of my ovaries.

rzsfqs,Healthyhooha,1641737227.0,"Hey, so I‚Äôm sharing this because I rarely saw success stories when I looked for them on Reddit and it made me feel hopeless.

Disclaimer - obv we‚Äôre all different and my solution won‚Äôt necessarily be your solution.

My issues began in March 2020 when I was 27. I was (and still am) in a long term relationship and I‚Äôm confident he didn‚Äôt cheat. (Thank you to the person on Reddit who told me that he definitely cheated and definitely gave me ureaplasma‚Ä¶ super helpful)

My symptoms were very itchy vagina, clear discharge, occasional smell but not fishy, a raw infected feeling, occasional tingling like I had been stung by an insect on the labia area. Sex hurt for my boyfriend and my ph was about 6.5. Running and walking was painful and itchy. 

Initially I tested positive for BV, had treatment and things got better. It came back but I never tested positive for BV again and the treatment didn‚Äôt work. Doctors thought I had thrush so treated me for that but again nothing worked.

I did all the things google suggested - I avoided baths, wore cotton underwear, used hydromol instead of shower gel, and took probiotics. 

I gave up and accepted that this was my life until summer 2021 when I couldn‚Äôt cope anymore and it was affecting my life so much. I had more tests and the only thing that came up was strep b. The gp said that shouldn‚Äôt cause any issues but because I was so desperate they agreed to treat me. I wondered if I had aerobic vaginitis so the gp agreed to treat me for that with vaginal antibiotics, hydrocortisone, probiotics, sea buckthorn and vitamin d. This didn‚Äôt work. 

Finally I saw a specialist at a sexual health clinic in the uk. He said that I did not have aerobic vaginitis and that strep b was not the issue. He did a range of tests and concluded I had a combination issue of low lactobacilli and a skin irritation. He prescribed me lactic acid (relactagel) for 7 days and something called daktacort, which was miconazole nitrate and hydrocortisone, for 6 weeks. Oh my word, it worked! My symptoms used to get worse before my period (an utterly unbearable itch) and now it‚Äôs gone. I feel normal for the first time in 2 years. 

Reddit has many uses but on this subreddit so many people told me I had ureaplasma. In the uk they don‚Äôt test for it or regard it as a concern, so this unnecessarily stressed me out. 

I‚Äôve continued to take sea buckthorn and vitamin d but I have no idea if they helped. 

I hope someone can find comfort from me sharing my story. It was a horrible experience but there is hope.

EDIT: it's now 18 months later and the issue has still pretty much gone away. I notice it reccurs a little just before my period is due and seems to be linked to the more thick sticky cervical mucus. I'm nt sure that is about but I apply dactocort when that happens and I make sure I consume probiotics such as kefir.

Additional edit 2024 - I still get so many messages about this post so wanted to update. The problem mostly went away but I had the odd flair up before my period. Daktocort helped but I also purchased Biofemme V probiotics and I think they really helped me. I haven‚Äôt had any issues since taking these. I‚Äôm now pregnant and have been fine during pregnancy so I think there is a hormonal element to this too.

I know the title sounds extreme, but hear me out - some people might need to hear this. Growing up, I always used mild, unscented soap to rinse my labia, using my hand to guide water wherever it needed to go. I still use soap to this day, however, a few years ago when I started having sex, I decided to be more thorough and was horrified at how much buildup I found. Since then, I swear by these techniques:

1. Stretch your labia minora (does not apply to everyone), and rub it between your thumb and forefinger to remove dead skin, discharge, and sometimes even leftover toilet paper. You want to be gentle, but thorough enough to ""exfoliate"" and get all the buildup in the crevices. When I do this, I can actually feel the buildup sloughing off.

2. This only applies if you have a hooded clitoris. Basically, you want to lift up the hood and let water run over the clit to remove any dead skin pooled around it. This area might be really sensitive for you, and  I would advice against ""exfoliating"" in the same way you would your labia, although I do rub the hood itself and gently wipe the perimeter of my clit where it meets the hood. 

3. I find that I sometimes get discharge buildup right outside my vagina. So without going into the vaginal canal itself, I make sure to clean AROUND the vagina and always wipe and rinse any buildup in the indented region between my labia minora, especially next to my perineum which is the indented portion that gets the most discharge buildup.


I have never had any vaginal health issues using these cleaning methods, since the cleaning occurs exclusively outside of the vaginal canal. I know that a lot of this probably isn't revolutionary, but I genuinely didn't know about this stuff until fairly recently and hope that this helps someone out.

176w56b,Healthyhooha,1697194970.0,"So, I'll try to keep it short and I'm posting this because it might be helpful for others. 

I started having thrush since I met my boyfriend 2 years ago. We went through multiple treatments, we both took antifungals, I was on one for 6 months, yada yada blah blah. Ureaplasma was suspected and it showed up then it was treated, tested, long clean for a looong time, still having thrush regularly. 

I was watching all aspects of my hygiene and diet. Cotton underwear and commando as much as possible, no low sugar, you name it. Full screening, tests, nothing but pesky candida that would go away and come back. 

After 6 months of medication everything was alright and then of course it started again. Devastating. 

So we were trying to find the reason it keeps happening and I've found out that my boyfriend washes his dick with SOAP before each time we have sex! Of course soap isn't rinsed off properly in majority of those cases and we have sex every day and sometimes twice a day! 

He kept disturbing my vaginal balance with a fucking soap for 2 years!!! ü§£ and he doubled down on it at some point as well because he thought that maybe he's not keeping himself squeaky clean lol i couldn't believe my ears. 

Two years of me going nuts trying to figure out why I'm having non stop thrush when i never had it before and it turns out that it's him and his desire to be as hygienic as possible. The thing is when we had sex 2 days ago as soon as his dick went in i felt burning sensation and now i know that it was badly rinsed out soap (that is also ultra heavily scented and I use it only for hands, my shower gel is always fragrance free). 

I love him but I wanted to kill him at the same time. No more soap for his dick. 

So this is something to keep in mind, ask your partners with dicks if they're soaping before having sex with you. 

Peace out ‚úåÔ∏è

UPDATE: today is November 1 and I happily inform everyone that I haven't had a single thrush episode since we figured this out. No more soap bar on his or my fingers, his penis or our toys. Only shower gel while taking a shower making sure it's rinsed off the external parts of the labia and penis (sometimes twice a day because we live in a hot climate) and plain water for freshening up in between. We use same sensitive shower gel to wash hands now as well. I ordered femenine wash gel and will use it for both hands and shower but so far just getting rid of a soap bar worked!!!

For those seeking feedback on their vulva with photos, the post MUST 1. Be marked NSFW. 2. The photo itself cannot be in the post. It must be linked to a host site. 3. Anyone posting this type of photo MUST be over 18.

Other photos, such as the odd funny meme or whatever, are fine.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey HoohaHavers!

Recently, we've been getting reports on most photos that are posted of vulvas/vaginas. The mods were on the fence about this for awhile, but for now we've decided to take down any current posts with NSFW photos attached, even if they're linked or marked NSFW. Going forward, photo submissions need to be cleared through the mods first. One of main concerns on our end is that there's not an easy to verify that the submitters are over the age of 18. Another personal concern I have is that truly, if you have a suspicious lesion or bump on your vulvar area, posting it here has very limited value. You might get some anecdotal responses from others that have had something similar, but from the very beginning we said that this sub is NOT an substitute for medical advice - even if many of us mods have a medical background. You're better off going in person to a clinic or OBGYN office to have it evaluated IRL - in a context where they can examine it, culture it, swab it, order medications, etc. to actually fix/address your problem. I know going to a clinic or doctor's office can be stressful or difficult or embarrassing, but it's still so important that if you can at all, try to get regular checkups and make appointments if you have problems. The healthcare workers you encounter have literally all seen hundreds of patients and your issue is often more common and treatable than you might think.

Thanks to everyone here for making this such a supportive community!

ehehr8,Healthyhooha,1577667020.0,"Research for a cure for herpes/cold sores is being conducted at the Fred Hutch Centre (FHC) for cancer research by Dr Jerome (M.D., Ph.D.) and his team. The majority of research done in this field focuses on vaccines while this research is aiming to find a cure. This research uses gene editing as a potential cure. While you have probably heard of CRISPR, Dr. Keith Jerome is using a different gene editor called meganucleases. This research is going incredibly well and I would like to spread the word about it to show support for the research being done.

Earlier this year Dr. Jerome explained in a presentation how his team have been able to target the latent HSV virus in two different places, as to cause them to completely unravel and disintegrate using gene editing. Just one injection of the meganuclease gene editors, was able to destroy up to 50% of latent HSV1 in mice in trigeminal nerve ganglia and up to 90% in the superior cervical ganglia. This disintegration of the latent virus greatly decreased replication of the remaining virus. Simply put, this was a partial cure--at least in mice. No off-target edits or other harmful effects were detected. The lab is now moving on to testing in guinea pigs which is deemed to be the gold-standard for pre human testing for herpes. Discussions with FHCs philanthropy manager confirmed that the lab is working towards a cure for both HSV-1 and HSV-2.

A peer reviewed paper is due to come out for this research in early 2020.

Dr. Jerome gave a video update of the HSV cure. He even gave our community a shout out, noting the fundraiser. You can watch the video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk5EO6RerCk&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk5EO6RerCk&feature=youtu.be)

In 2012 the World Health Organisation estimated that 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) have HSV-1 infection globally and an estimated 417 million people aged 15-49 (11%) worldwide have HSV-2 infection. Even if you do not have herpes/cold sores yourself you will know someone who does. A cure or even a vaccine would benefit billions of people.

Fundraiser: 

This research is currently partially funded by NIH but this fundraiser has greatly helped Dr Jerome to continue his work. The fundraiser was set up in late 2018 to help support Dr. Jerome's research at the Fred Hutch centre and has managed to reach $50,000 in donations in less than a year! This is incredible and has allowed Dr Jerome‚Äôs team to begin guinea pig testing (the gold standard, pre-human test) roughly a year ahead of schedule.

Let me say that again, $50,000 in donations in less than a year!

If you wish to help support his research through the fundraiser the link is here: [http://engage.fredhutch.org/site/TR?px=1709211&fr\_id=1574&pg=personal](http://engage.fredhutch.org/site/TR?px=1709211&fr_id=1574&pg=personal)

If you are able to give, even a small amount it would immensely help the progress towards a cure. Seeing the number of people donating also helps, as it shows those doing research or funding research for a cure or vaccine, the amount of people who would like progress to be made towards a cure for herpes. Simply supporting this research, along with other companies research with vaccines, through sharing and liking/up voting posts will help this cause. This is a way for our voices to be heard.

TL;DR: There's a very promising herpes cure being developed using gene editing at the Fred Hutch Centre for cancer research.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/ehehr8/research_for_a_cure_for_herpescold_sores_this/,"Research for a cure for herpes/cold sores!

12lbc4w,Periods,1681428765.0,"y‚Äôall‚Ä¶ let me begin with: everything is fine now! 

today is 4/13/23. on 12/18/22, i thought i may have lost a tampon inside of me. i called my gyno‚Äôs physician on call and essentially was told that this wasn‚Äôt possible‚Ä¶ i looked for it myself for 15 min and could not find anything. i ultimately decided that i had in fact removed the tampon before my shower and just didn‚Äôt remember. i put in another afterwards..

3/21 was the last day of my last cycle. i noticed a horrible smell i‚Äôve never had before. i assumed BV, went to urgent care, got put on antibiotics for 7 days. i even did STD testing (neg). smell was still there after meds, so i asked for a gel suppository med instead. i finished those and smell subsided for 2ish days. 

yesterday 4/12 i started my current cycle and i was using tampons as i usually do. i noticed that the smell was particularly foul.. like rotten flesh. 

some time passed and i eventually self diagnosed with PID, bought some pads instead (read that tampons + PID is a bad idea) went back and forth for hours about if i should go to the ER or wait to see my doctor because i thought i had a gnarly infection in my uterus. i woke up at 12am with a terrible feeling in my gut so i went to the ER. 

took vitals, had blood drawn, and a pelvic exam. upon exam, the doctor FOUND THE TAMPON. it was removed. it was in there for nearly 4 months. the smell in that exam room was beyond atrocious. i was mortified.

i am incredibly lucky that i did not die of TSS or septic shock. all of my blood work came back clear and normal, no infection. i literally could have died. i‚Äôve promised myself to never use another tampon because this experience scarred me and apparently my memory can‚Äôt be trusted. 

PLEASE‚Ä¶. be careful. i‚Äôve been using tampons exclusively for 10yrs and this is the first time this has happened to me. it was so scary.

jn65mt,Periods,1604388754.0,"So, I‚Äôm suffering from severe dysmenorrhea. My period has always been painful but the past few years the pain changed - it‚Äôs worse, it hits different, it‚Äôs debilitating, painkillers don‚Äôt work, I‚Äôm stuck in bed for days. It hurts when I pee, when I poop, when I move; I get butt lightnings, heavy pulling pain in my uterus, painful gas; it wasn‚Äôt like this before and naturally, I went to see a gynecologist. Never had penetrative sex, my periods are quite regular otherwise. 

My first gynecologist was an older lady, very professional and experienced. However, listening to my complaints, she concluded mid-way I was fine without even initially running any tests. She then did an abdominal ultrasound, found a few cysts on each ovary and said those are normal as well, and prescribed to me ... a supplement and an even heavier NSAID (after I told her they don‚Äôt work on me). I was disheartened but still believed in her decision. Fast forward to my following period, I was in even worse pain, her supplement and prescription strength NSAID had no effect. 

I then went to consult another gynecologist for a second opinion. It was a younger lady. She listened to my complaints, then went on to explain to me thoroughly about the types of period pain and the conditions that could be causing them. She said there is no use to keep stuffing myself with painkillers and that it‚Äôs more harm than good at that point. She concluded that it might be endometriosis and suggested putting me on the pill to hopefully ease the severe pain and PMS and help rule out whether it‚Äôs endo or not. I was .. shocked. Wow! An actual treatment. And my pain wasn‚Äôt brushed off as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. 

Have any of you noticed this in your experience with gynecologists (or other doctors)?

EDIT: I just created r/LabiaplastySurgery so hopefully interested women will find us over there and we can build a little community!

The basics: I'm 23 and got a bilateral labiaplasty on Dec. 14 because my labia minora were 2.5-3 inches long and were extremely annoying and uncomfortable. I asked my OBGYN about a labiaplasty during a routine exam and he basically said, ""Yep. They are pretty long. I can get your insurance to cover it, let's book the operation."" So I did and here I am 1 week out. 

There was a complication where they couldn't get me to stop bleeding during the procedure and I ended up developing a pretty gnarly hematoma (basically a really severe bruise where there's so much blood trapped under the skin that it forms a pocket/sac). The pain was intense and I spent a night in the ER on morphine where doctors monitored the hematoma and were prepared to lance it the next morning if there was no improvement. They decided it would be more risky to open it back up and drain it, so they sent me home and it ended up going almost completely away as of today (7 days since procedure). That's a pretty rare complication as far as I know.

It's still swollen and puffy and painful but it is steadily improving. I'm on 5-10mg oxycodone & ibuprofen.

m26em3,Periods,1615405140.0,"Anyone find it immensely frustrating when men try to compare their pains to having a period? 

My best friend (a male) and I have been going back and forth about what‚Äôs more painful. He says that getting kicked in the balls is more painful than girls have on their periods, that prostate exams that men usually get are more painful than a pap smear, and so on. Saying that men have it so much worse than we do. He said that as girls get older we learn to deal with our periods more... Well, I‚Äôve had my period for almost 15 years now and I‚Äôm still trying to find ways on how to deal with it each month.

Not to mention, we have periods to tell us that we‚Äôre not pregnant. In reality most of us probably only get 1-2 normal weeks in a month. With PMSing, ovulation, and our actual periods we can feel all over the place and out of sorts. And of course the pain and cramps that comes with periods. 

So why do men feel the need to compare these things to use and belittle us in a sense? It can be so frustrating sometimes. Sure each gender goes through something different but it‚Äôs only thing to try to ‚Äúone-up‚Äù women and their periods, pap smears, pregnancy, etc. It‚Äôs especially frustrating when men try to tell us what to do with our bodies when they don‚Äôt even have a uterus.

14a3whe,WomensHealth,1686839413.0,"The present-day pelvic exam, born through the graceless adequacy of a bent gravy spoon to an overzealous surgeon in the mid-19th century, is a nightmare. Women all over curse the scene: the cold, clanky metal, the inelegance, the uncomfortable endogenous stretching ‚Äî or is it pressure? But along with 65 million other women in the United States each year, I reluctantly make my appointment to be poked, prodded, and probed by a stranger all for the reassurance that my vagina looks ordinary.

Upon arrival at the gynecologist‚Äôs, I am taken to an exam room, weighed, and asked about my sexual history and menstrual cycle before the clinician politely asks me to undress. When they step out, I strip down, fold my clothes neatly, and place them on the chair. God forbid the person who is about to have their hand inside me is offended by the sight of my panties, so I take care to tuck them under my jeans. I replace them with a sterile johnny and assume my position at the edge of the exam table, tearing the crinkly paper beneath me. I spend the rest of my time alone biting my fingernails and reading the hand-washing posters on the wall ‚Äî failed attempts to distract myself from my nervous anticipation of the procedure to come.

Within minutes, I‚Äôm lying spread-eagled with my feet in stirrups and the clinician‚Äôs face disconcertingly close to my nether regions. As I hold my breath, the practitioner, with a smile too cheery for the situation, produces a jangly steel clamp that would not look out of place in an assortment of medieval torture devices. The bivalve thing taunts me with its clumsy tambourine clatter as its sharp edges enter my most sensitive anatomy. Once inside, a scissor-like mechanism opens me up to reveal my cervix.

The instrument, formally known as the vaginal speculum, is as technologically primitive as the era that spawned it ‚Äî a maladroit, Procrustean apparatus guaranteed to unsettle even the strongest of constitutions. As I reclined on a clammy table in a clinic in Boston, home of one of the most progressive medical and biotechnology ecosystems in the world, it struck me: How, in a time of untold innovation such as we live in, is this aspect of women‚Äôs health care ‚Äî the dreaded pelvic exam ‚Äî still stuck in the 19th century?

Not long after, I decided first to take aim at the speculum and next, to reconsider the pelvic exam.

yf966z,Healthyhooha,1666918900.0,"I‚Äôve been dealing with vaginal issues for 2 YEARS. It‚Äôs been exhausting. Since the very beginning, I realized that most doctors don‚Äôt know SHIT about complicated vaginal issues. In my first year of dealing with mystery vaginal irritation/recurring infections, I saw over 10 different doctors, including a urogynecologist. I tried every treatment you could think of. No one could give me answers beyond ‚Äúwear cotton underwear‚Äù or ‚Äúdon‚Äôt use soap down there‚Äù. It was so beyond frustrating to have to be my own doctor. I researched online, I read articles. At one point I suggested I might have CV to a doctor, and she said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not a thing‚Äù. I was told I wasn‚Äôt swollen or red by people who were looking at my vagina for the first time. I explained my symptoms and triggers again and again, to no avail. No one could help me. 

I‚Äôm doing sort of better now, but it saddens me to see similar experiences on this subreddit every day. I feel like women‚Äôs healthcare is getting WORSE. Why is it so impossible to get decent and compassionate care? This week I had that familiar itch, and the only person I could get in with on short notice was a midwife. She was completely dismissive about my history, didn‚Äôt ask any questions other than the usual ‚Äúdo you sleep with no underwear‚Äù and ‚Äúdo you use scented detergent‚Äù. She asked me these questions after I TOLD her I‚Äôd been having recurring vaginal issues for TWO YEARS. Like I‚Äôm so stupid I hadn‚Äôt thought of those things??? SO Insulting. 

Anyways. The other thing that really pissed me off was as she was swabbing me, she asked if I planned to have kids. I told her not at this time, and she kept going on and on about it. Telling me I was getting older, things would be more dangerous‚Ä¶to add insult to injury. I left that appointment with a confirmed yeast infection and SO much anger and sadness. I know she‚Äôs a midwife so she probably focuses on babies and shit, but god damn-can‚Äôt I get swabbed without getting that talk? Is being a woman only about being able to get pregnant? 

I feel like If I were to tell a doctor I wanted to get pregnant but I had recurring issues, I would get better care than if I were to just say I had recurring issues. Also, to reiterate-most doctors don‚Äôt know shit about vaginal infections-so don‚Äôt rely on the alone to help you. I had doctor after doctor just tell me to do metronidazole, even though it never worked long term.

My gyno explained this to me like it would be NO BIG DEAL. Fine. I get there, didn't realize it's a whole ""procedure"" that I needed to sign for.

I used to feel inferior to these daily washers but now I‚Äôm wondering if half these people even wash? What do they do in there? Just let the water get them wet and call it a shower?

I‚Äôve even seen people say they just use their hands to wash.

How often do you shower? What do you actually do in the shower? Do you shower the same every time or have special showers where you actually clean your body?

1auboef,Healthyhooha,1708308120.0," When you hit menopause, the amount of estrogen in your body drops precipitously, some to zero production anywhere. The outer vaginal area including the urethral tissue opening is coated in androgen receptors- when they stop receiving androgens/sex hormones in the form of estrogen, they start to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, and causing more infections.

Low dose local estrogen cream, applied to the area topically 3x a week, effectively nourishes these tissues and can prevent vaginal atrophy and urethral atrophy, preserving sexual and urinary function into old age. This low local dose does not affect systemic estrogen levels, and can be started at any phase of menopause or post-menopause. It's about $30 a month through reasonable insurance costs, though I've seen some companies charging more. You have to go around to find a doctor that will give a continuous prescription because it's like brushing you're teeth- you need to do it forever.

uig911,WomensHealth,1651697414.0,"What about me? I was 35 at the time and found out I was pregnant with baby # 3! We were over the moon excited. This was such a blessing for our family. We could not wait to tell our family and friends. We told our first two children two days before Christmas. We said we had an early present for them. To see the joy on their faces and to witness the excitement knowing they were going to have another sibling was something I will never forget. That joy soon faded away. Three days later I went to have my 12 week ultrasound. We were planning our gender reveal for that night. I saw the whole thing planned in my head. Then the ultrasound tech started asking me questions, she was pressing down hard on my stomach trying to get a better picture. I was wincing in pain and squeezing my husband‚Äôs hand, still smiling trying to figure out names for my new baby. Then the Dr came in and she began to do conduct my ultrasound. It was then that I knew something was wrong. She started explaining to me that my baby‚Äôs nuchal was not the size it should be. She started speaking but all I could hear was noise. I could not believe the words that were coming out of her mouth. How could this happen? Down syndrome, Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, all things I have heard of but didn‚Äôt think could ever be a part of my life. The next thing I knew I was dressed and sitting in the doctor‚Äôs office and she was asking me if I wanted to continue with this pregnancy or did I want to terminate. She said I should consider this because in NY women only have the right to terminate the pregnancy up until 24? Weeks. I can‚Äôt really remember the exact number because at that point I was crying my eyes out and saying why me? I walked into the hospital full of joy and walked out full of sorrow and questions. I was determined not have any disease. I prayed to God to make it be all a dream. The next day I made an appointment to have a CVS test performed to see if we could get clearer results. I had to sit with a genetic counselor and we had to go over all of these things that I did not want to. Hearing how long the results would take put a knife deeper into my chest. I had to live 10 days longer not knowing any answers. Do you know how long that feels like. Smiling to my children and trying not to break down when they kissed my belly because they were so happy to have a new baby. Trying not to scream when they would ask me a question about the baby because I wasn‚Äôt sure if there was going to be a baby there anymore. All of this going on in my head asking God to give me the strength to get through the next few weeks. Questions, that‚Äôs all I had. What if‚Äôs, well what if I continue on and the baby dies right after I give birth? What if I continue on and I miscarry at 35 weeks? What if the baby is born and dies a week later? These are questions no parent should ever have to have go through their head. We got the preliminary results back and it showed that the baby did NOT have any disease!! WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why did the doctor tell me this for? How can this be? Go back for another scan. Emotions are scattered and hopes are high. If the nuchal is different in this sono then maybe we have a chance. NOPE!! Techs still see there is an issue. The Dr. informs us that our daughter most likely has turner syndrome. OUR DAUGHTER!!!!!!!!! My hopes were shattered again. People with turners do not live a full life says web md. How will our life be different? Can I handle a child with a disability? Will I have to quit my job? Who will be there to help with my other kids? Can we afford this? QUESTIONS!!!!! As my husband and I are driving home from that appointment we get a call from the genetic counselor to tell us that the prelim results were incorrect!!! Our baby indeed had Trisomy 18. What did that mean? Trusty google tells me that means that my baby can die before its born, die 2 minutes after I deliver, 2 hours, 2 days, 2 weeks after birth. Having that news answered some of my questions. But now WE had to make a decision. My husband and I had to make a decision of what WE wanted to do with our family. Keep in mind my other two children notice that mommy and daddy are upset all the time and sad. Mommy cries a lot and all she wants to do is sleep. What decision do we make? Time is running out, we need to make this decision because we only have a few weeks left before WE are not allowed to make a decision anymore. What I want you to take from this is knowing that I had a CHOICE. I knew that the ultimate decision to make was mine. I was up against a time clock but in the end I still had time to make that decision. I can‚Äôt imagine having to go through what I went through and not have the CHOICE to do what was best for my family and I. I get the people who say that a fetus cannot make a decision for themselves. I understand that. But what is the purpose of being a parent? Aren‚Äôt we supposed to protect our children and guide them and help them make decisions for themselves? Have you ever asked a 5 year old what they want for dinner? Should I ask my one year old if he wants Tylenol because his new molars are coming in? As a parent we are obliged to make decisions for our kids everyday.

I‚Äôve been on the pill for 10 years and with recent events in the US I decided maybe it‚Äôs best to try an IUD for a more permanent option. I got kyleena inserted last week and had no issues other than the initial insertion pain. A few days ago I woke up with a fever, chills, discharge, and sharp pelvic pain. I knew this had to be related to my IUD so I made a same day appointment at my obgyn to get it removed. The nurse almost turned me away before I got to see the doctor due to my high fever and suggested I take some Tylenol and stay home  instead. I just knew that my sickness had to be related to my IUD, this was no normal flu, so I pushed to see the doctor that day. The doctor came to do a pelvic exam and quickly pulled it out like I begged her too and she gave me some antibiotics to ease the symptoms and fix the infection. 

The next day I woke up with the same fever and chills but I couldn‚Äôt remove my body, I could hardly get dressed or eat. My pelvic pain had mostly subsided but I didn‚Äôt feel much better. I mustered up the guts to go to an urgent care and they ran a blood test and almost immediately pushed me out the door to go to the ER. I got to the ER and discovered that basically my IUD and the infection were related, I got pneumonia and went into sepsis which explains the fever and my exponential WBC count. Just my luck, I also turned out to be allergic to the antibiotics that my obgyn prescribed and I broke out into a full body rash.

After a few days of fluids and antibiotics, I was discharged and now I‚Äôm home with some meds that I‚Äôll finish in the next couple days. I‚Äôm extremely lucky that I was able to know I wasn‚Äôt well and that my obgyn would remove my IUD so soon after insertion.

I get infections with or without a condom and yesterday for some reason I decided to sniff the Skyn Condoms we occasionally use (we use them purely for a barrier, not for pregnancy prevention). I started looking into it and apparently there is fragrance oil added to camouflage the condom smell that all condoms have. 

Upon searching for non latex, non lubricated condoms, I find nothing but an article with a female condom that is basically like ""wash it out and use it, it should be fine."" I kinda want to die and this infuriates me. Why do condoms have fragrance? Why are there not some plain condoms that don't have some fucking additive to fuck vaginas up?

Just wanted to make a PSA in case anyone else has been having issues and unable to find the culprit. The fragrance oil in Skyn condoms might be it.

106enap,Healthyhooha,1673168601.0,"Had years-long experience going to multiple gynecologists with what started as chronic yeast and bv infections. But then there were no more infections. The symptoms lingered and I also had that very sensitive and uncomfortable awareness of my urethra, bladder pain, Urinary frequency, itching and irritation of my labia, and pain in my vagina sometimes during sex, sometimes not.

Throughout this experience, I was finally seen by a urogynecologist who recognized that I had a hypertonic muscle in my pelvic floor. I was referred to a pelvic floor therapist and my symptoms gradually remitted for a long time following therapy.

Recently had a scare where I thought I had a yeast infection. Used boric acid and it messed me up, I had an awful reaction. All the same symptoms I had before- back in full force. I was terrified and got in to see my gynecologist right away. They prescribed me a muscle relaxer to use three times a day. This helped a lot. Started doing a routine I found on YouTube for pelvic floor release and using my pelvic floor wand once it started hurting less. Pain and symptoms- totally gone. And the tests came back negative. I am always in awe of how muscular issues in pelvic floor can so mimic an infection. And I don‚Äôt think doctors discuss this enough if ever because it took me years to find a urogynecologist who did.

Tl;dr pelvic floor dysfunction / muscle spasm can feel just like a uti, bv, or a yeast infection. It is crazy. If you have unremitting pain and infections have been ruled out consider a pelvic floor physical therapist

ki5bn7,WomensHealth,1608643693.0,"Content Warning: many anecdotes of suffering and doctors failing to do their job.

----------------------------

Posting this here because I don't feel safe posting this in some other more generic medical oriented place and I just wanted a warm place full of women to vent to so I hope this is alright, but I'm also curious if other queer women/women of color in this sub have shared experiences since I know there's a lot that do.

Anyways; in an attempt to sum up the majority of my situation; since march (coincidentally the same time lockdown happened) i began to experience terrible bladder symptoms. (I chalked it up to a UTI, went to the ER, the attending doctor spoke to me and said the same thing I thought; that it was a UTI; gave me antibiotics, sent me on my way. They helped, but it didn't quite go away after 7 days so I requested another weeks worth since it was helping.

This doctor was different. he was rude, dismissive and claimed I never had a UTI because nothing grew in the urine culture. It was the blood and the nitrates in my urine that prompted the uti diagnosis, obviously there wasn't time to see if the culture would grow yet but the female doctor was confident as was I.

Anyways, long story short, it's December and I'm still dealing with those UTI symptoms. Theres always blood and nitrates in my urine 50+ urine samples later through out the year; but nothing grows so they dismiss it, and for some reason the consistent blood and nitrates doesn't at all convince them to dig further; so I've suffered needlessly with that.

Next for the last 5 weeks, since I had a tooth extraction, things go sideways. My tongue turns white, I'm having the worst  post tooth distraction pain ever (wasn't my first rodeo) and my esophagus kept closing up on me; plus i passed out. that was the first day; second day i eat food for the first time since the extraction, my stomach goes nuclear. bloats up, dire pain in the right-of-center, lower right, mid right, just excrutiating. I return to the ER twice that night because its literally the worst thing I've ever dealt with in my life (and I've had bad pneumonia; more on that later) they do NOTHING. and after 12 hours of doing nothing but a blood test and the doctor having the nerve to say i was fine. I asked him if he'd be at least willing to do an ultrasound; he laughed and said ""he didn't need to because he knew i was fine; then he threatened to call security""

Stomach pain continues; i end up not eating a thing for over a week; and this is ontop of the bladder issues I'm still coping with and what has nowbecome dry socket of my tooth extraction.

The following week, its not getting better, its getting worse, so I go back to the hospital, but this time under my dentists orders because he's worried that my tooth infection may still be around.

The doctor sees me; I instruct him to call my dentist as I was told to and then he inspects my mouth ""Looks fine."" he says. 

""What about my white tongue?""

""Discoloration, you need to brush your teeth more""

and that was essentially it, i was dismissed. I was also told that night not to come back to the ER anymore unless I was *vomiting blood everywhere*

So i go to my dentist the next day; he takes one look at my tongue and diagnoses it as thrush and refers to my attending ER doctor the night before as an *idiot* 

So I get thrush stuff for my mouth but its not really helping, another week goes by and my uncle helpsme out and sets me up with an appointment with his family doctor.

-------------------------------------------

As an aside, I'll note that I blame my original family doctor for the death of my 55 year old mother who suffered through years of his dismissals, bullying her, mocking her, gaslighting her, until she was afraid to go back and so her cancer came back and she died.

I've been in a similar boat; as in 2017; for a month I was having trouble breathing and I had cold-like symptoms. my doctor including 2 ER doctors and 2 walk-in-clinic doctors; ALL said it was a mild cold or a nasal drip. one had the nerve to tell me to *toughen up* 

So I did, I went home, and just tried to deal with it. I lost my job at the time because I was unable to work for over a month. So a month goes by and its getting *worse* finally I call my doctors office again and by luck he's on a golfing vacation so he has a fill in doctor. I see this doctor and like RIGHT AWAY he expresses concern and sends me to get an emergency x-ray.

Sure enough not only did I have pneumonia, but 76% of my lungs were fucked. He commented that he didn't understand how I was talking fine and walking fine (helloooo, woman with chronic pain constantly ignored by doctors over here; kind of used to coping through suffering) So I tried to make a joke because I've literally dealt with it for a month by saying ""well I was told it was a nasal drip so I *toughened up* like they told me to. I was trying to be sassy and he yelled at me that it was serious and I could die. I decided not to say ""blame the medical system, not me"" but I wanted to.... anyways needed to add that little story for later relevancy

-----------------------------

Alright so this new family doctor; writs down everything I'm dealing with, takes a lot of notes. sends me to do a bunch of blood and urine tests and stuff. a week later he's like ""yeah so I'm prescribing you an anti depressant"" since he believed *that* was the source of all my issues, *like yeah totally, my depression is causing the loss of my bladder, bowel and disgestion functions, makes perfect sense!*

I warned him i had been on that type before and I had a bad reaction to it (suicidal thoghts/mental breakdown) and i also said i was weary about going through that again since I'm already at the end of my rope. He insisted and ignored me, stating ""this is the best one there is, it'll work""

So like clockwork; 3 days in I'm having a full manic melt down , my brains not working, so I call his office; no answer, of course. so I decide to just stop taking them, and it got better.

So the next week I call him explain that I'm not taking them and would be more than happy to experiment with them *when* I'm healthier. He finally caved and agreed to set me up with a gastroenterologist for my stomach problems and I talk to that doctor within the week. he decides my thrush not going away despite using a medication for it the entire time, could be a worse problem; wont know for sure until the endoscope, but he prescribes me a stronger anti fungal, which was reassuring especially since these tests could  take months.

So moving on to this last week; the tooth pain comes back, this time its the tooth next to my extraction, the gums swell, my cheek swells, i start getting brain fog, headaches, shakey, heart palpatations. I already hadn't been sleeping but now it wasn't even worth trying. so I get into my dentist the day he's closing up for the holidays and he says it doesn't look infected. 

(Note: my dentist ironically has been the only doctor that feels like he's been on my side and actually cares. to put it into perspective, most Canadians pay out of pocket for dental as it isn't covered by the generic medical that all canadians get, and yet he took hours out of his time to speak to me, calling me, checking up on me, to make sure i was alright and even giving me dietary suggestions to ease my suffering for my current stomach issues. solid guy)

So I trust him, but 3 days in, its getting so bad, head is throbbing, face is swollen, gums in that area are huge and pained, and i cant sleep despite being beyond exhausted. i passout form exhaustion an di wake up every 5 minutes to the palpatations of my heart and throbbing of my face.

Now we get to tonight. Its worse and worse (ofcourse on top of bladder issues, stomach issues, and chronic muscle pain) Im trying my best to to just remain curled up in my chair, trying to get through it, when suddenly my right eye starts hurting like crazy out of no where. and my immediate thought is *this is an infection and now its getting out of control* So I suck it up and go back to the ER and think ""screw it, even if I'm not vomiting blood""

So I get in, and the attending ER doctor that sees me, is the same guy who looked at my mouth before; said it was fine and my tongue was just discolored, so immediately my heart has sank.

So, when he asks me what the problem i tonight (since he recognized me) I explain ""ive still got a lot of unexplained symptoms but all im here for tonight is fear that I have a tooth infection because my head is throbbihng, im shaking, i have had a head ache for a week and constant brain fog and then I mention my eye started hurting too right before i came in.

He takes a look at my mouth. dismissively says it looks fine, the same way he did the first time; then i ask him to look at my eye; he does; ""looks fine"" he says, and by that point he's already  heading to leave and send me home and so i have a melt down.

I start crying, I call him dismissive and i call him out for misdiagnosing the thrush the first time; and he kind of shrugs and says ""i was just calling it how i saw it"" and then hes like 'you should be at a dentist not here"" (mind you its like 1 in the morning, no dentists are open at 1 in the morning, and my dentist is on xmas holidays till the 4th)

so I say ""fine yeah ill go, its not like ive been sititng in the fetal posiiton for 5 weeks, not sleeping, not eating; but I sure am 'fine' (Mind you I dont usually get that way with doctors but after suffering so much, im so sick of them doing nothing.)

This is when I'm barely getting my words out because I'm crying (sometimes the really rude dismissive doctors make me cry then they use that to call me emotional and build it up to prove I'm just over exaggerating) but I go off on a rant about how my grandmother died at 61 because a doctor dismissed early symptoms of cancer and that my mom died at 55, because she was gaslit so much by her doctor she was *afraid* to go back and it killed her and that i nearly died in 2017 because many doctors ""were just saying how they saw it"" and I was tired of doctors being dismissive rather than actually *listening* to the patient.

anyways, my dismissive comment clearly bothered him because he started repeating ""im not being dismissive!"" and then he said ""fine what do you want / what do you think you need from me"" 

and I cried again and said ""I dont know; thats the problem? I dont know whats wrong with me, but I know its bad--but it doesnt matter, all i came here for was fear of an infection because Im already dealing with SO MUCH pain and organ issues, I literally dont have the mental capacity to deal with more, but you say it doesnt look infected so ill take your word for it and have peace of mind and just suffer through till i can see my dentist"" and I get up to leave; he stops me and says ""what about some iv fluids? (fyi im severely malnourished and dehydrated due to my stomach issue) so I say ""alright fine"" and then he offers me something for the inflammation and some atavan to calm me down.

the fluids were a tiny bit revitalizing but nothing else really helped and he comes back after and says ""alright; it helped?"" and by this point im tired and i know hes trying to get rid of me again so I say ""yeah a little I think."" then i rub my eye again and I add ""but my eye is still really bugging me""

So, obviously determined to prove he's not dismissive, he leaves and rolls in this mega scope thing. drops some numbing stuff in my eye and some dye and starts looking at it under this bright blue light; and sure enough, I can tell something is wrong because he's taking a long time to look at my eye. Finally after an uncomfortable length of sitting still, he says he found something weird; starts asking me a bunch of weird questions, all of which I answered No to, which confounded him more; weirder yet he had to go get another doctor to come in and do it again on me for a second opinion.

After they discussed, he explained he was prescribing me an antiviral for some thing in my eye and setting me up with an eye doctor because apparently if this goes unchecked i can go blind; and it could be the cause of all the head throbbing pain I've had of late, so there we go, FINALLY one out of like 10 major things I'm dealing with, *actually* gets an explanation. I was really appreciative of him after that but then he had to ruin it by being smug and saying ""bet you're glad you didnt walk out""


I just said 'yes' but oof I wanted to say ""yeah im glad I kicked your ass into acting like an actual fucking doctor for once"" because the only reason I was ready to leave is because im so fed up with the dismissive attitude, but me calling him on it actually seemed to work. but thats my whole problem. I shouldnt have to be driven to tears and forced to unload some speech in an attempt to revive his missing empathy *just* to get the doctor to run a test on the thing im complaining about. *you know like a doctor is paid to do*

So anyways, whew, that was an obscenely long rant that i needed to get off my chest. I'm a queer woman and I've put up with this behavior most of my life, but with everything getting so bad, I'm terrified I'm going to die like my mom and grandmother, all because some doctor is too full of his own ego, and the year before my mother died, she was dealing with nearly the same symptoms i have been; trouble walking, bladder issues, digestive issues, bowel issues, progressively more nearing the end, and with her eventually going blind as well.

So yeah that just adds more stress and paranoia to me, because doctors either ignore most of my symptoms or refuse to entertain even the slimmest possibility there may be a connection as I've been dealing with the same thing, organ failure after organ failure.

Anyways sorry about that, thank you for reading my rant if you did, really just need solidarity from other women right now, especially women who know exactly what I'm talking about.

I had the Mirena IUD put in in my early 30s. The process, for me, was so painful that I fainted on the table. I regained consciousness to an empty room and an oxygen mask over my face.

I was so embarrassed - I got dressed and ran out. 

Fast forward a few years. I'm supposed to have a colposcopy with cervical biopsy.

What I want to understand is why this is considered normal practice? Why are we not numbing the cervix and warning ladies ahead of time about the *real* pain associated with what they're having done? These doctors are going to remove live tissue with an endocervical curette or some special type of forceps, and we're expected to just lay there quietly while they do this!? This is insanity. Why are we allowing this?

flr0jx,Healthyhooha,1584689956.0,"I'm writing this in tears of frustration because I'm so tired of this bullshit.

I had surgery in September to remove an infected Bartholin's gland that had become a nasty abscess internally growing *into* my anus. One thousand percent the most painful experience I've ever gone through and one I pray I'll never have to go through again. The whole process of the abscess developing took less than 24 hours - literally, one day I was perfectly healthy and the next I was being rushed to the ER with agonizing pain and the worst fever of my life. I spent all night in the ER waiting for my gynecologist to get to the hospital. Only problem was, I was admitted at 2:00 am and my gynecologist couldn't come in until 11:00 am. This meant I had to endure nine whole hours of the worst pain I've ever felt, the worst fever I've ever had, and a throbbing vulva that looked as if it had been inflated like a damn balloon and was now at least quadruple its size. 

After the gynecologist arrived, she informed me of my two options: drain the abscess and send me home or remove the gland to avoid another abscess forming again. I opted for removal and was scheduled for surgery at 7:00 pm that same day. I had a fever of 104 degrees for over eighteen hours, up until the abscess was removed. The whole process was hellish. 

Finally after surgery I felt enormous relief and was excited to be sent back home. Gyno told me I had to stay on bedrest for ten days and after that I'd be just fine. 

***I must say, this was a lot of bullshit***.

It took me over two months to make a *full* recovery, seeing as incisions for these surgeries are *not* stitched, but instead left open for the wound to heal from inside out. Ladies (and curious reader), this incision was about one and a half inches deep, right next to the opening of my vagina. ***One. And a half. Inches. Deep.*** I genuinely thought the pain before surgery was bad, but the calvary that was recovering from this surgery is honestly something I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. 

After weeks of daily rinses, cream and powder applications, antibiotics, painkillers and bedrest, the wound finally healed enough to where there was no visible flesh. I was finally back to my old self - walking free of pain, working out, having sex, the whole nine yards. 

Until this week, when I was hit with BV and the incision site now looks like it was stung by twenty bees. I'm having even more pain than I ever had during recovery. I can't walk, I can't sit up or sit down, I can‚Äôt sit on the toilet to pee, I can't even move while laying down without sharp, stabbing pain in my now so loathed hooha. I feel truly miserable. Thankfully my gyno is still working despite the crazy pandemic going on, and she was able to see me this week and prescribe medication. But I'm now afraid that every time I get BV or a yeast infection this is going to be my life. 

My grandmother almost slapped the living breath out of me once for saying I'd wished I was born a boy; but god damn it, I've never heard of my boyfriend going through half the shit with his penis as I have with this birthing tool.

nbvb2a,WomensHealth,1620950491.0,"People can sometimes be quick to slap on the label ‚Äúlibido issues‚Äù when they have a complicated relationship to sex. Women, in particular, can feel as if they have trouble with sexual desire, when in reality, the issue may be much more contextual.

There are¬†two types of sexual desire: spontaneous desire and responsive desire. Spontaneous desire means you can get turned on and feel like having sex almost randomly out of the blue, whereas responsive desire means you find yourself turned on when you‚Äôre already in a sexual situation. Sometimes people with responsive desire think they have a low libido, especially if their partner has spontaneous desire. But in reality, these responsive folks generally may have plenty of desire for sex‚Äîthey just need a specific context to access it. It‚Äôs not gonna just happen out of the blue.

In her groundbreaking book¬†Come As You Are, sex researcher¬†Emily Nagoski, Ph.D., describes sexual context as one of the most important elements of female sexual desire. She writes, ‚ÄúContext is made of two things: the circumstances of the present moment‚Äîwhom you‚Äôre with, where you are, whether the situation is novel or familiar, risky or safe, etc.‚Äîand your brain state in the present moment‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre relaxed or stressed, trusting or not, loving or not, right now, in the moment.‚Äù¬†

Back in 2010, research by clinical psychologists¬†Katie McCall, Ph.D., and¬†Cindy Meston, Ph.D., identified four¬†categories of sexual cues¬†that are key to women‚Äôs sexual desire:

1.¬†Love/emotional bonding cues

For some people, feeling close and emotionally connected to your partner in a given moment is part of what makes you feel like having sex. Nagoski offered this example in her book: ‚ÄúA woman told me the extraordinarily romantic story of a boyfriend who flew halfway around the globe to surprise her for their second anniversary of dating. Talk about closeness, commitment, and special attention. Yeah, that man got¬†laid.‚Äù

Some examples of this type of cue from McCall and Meston‚Äôs research:¬†

\- Feeling a sense of love with a partner

\- Feeling a sense of security in your relationship

\- Your partner is supportive of you

\- Your partner does ‚Äúspecial‚Äù or ‚Äúloving‚Äù things for you

\- Feeling a sense of commitment from a partner

\- Your partner expresses interest in hearing about you

\- Talking about the future with your partner

\- Feeling protected by a partner or protective of a partner

2.¬†Explicit/erotic cues

These have to do with more obviously sexual cues, like watching, reading, or hearing something sexy happening. You might not be in the mood for sex at all, but then you find yourself in the middle of an intensely hot¬†Outlander¬†scene, and suddenly you‚Äôre¬†feeling¬†it.

Some examples from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Watching a sexy movie

\- Watching or listening to other people having sex

\- Talking about sex or ‚Äútalking dirty‚Äù

\- Sensing your own or your partner‚Äôs wetness or erection

\- Asking for or anticipating sexual activity

\- Hearing your partner tell you that they fantasized about you

\- Having a sexual fantasy (e.g., having a sexual dream, daydreaming)

3.¬†Visual/proximity cues

Sometimes there are certain types of behaviors, body types, or body parts that just get you going when you see them. It might be catching a glimpse of a girl‚Äôs bare hip bones or seeing a dude take off his shirt to reveal tattoos all over his toned arms.¬†

Some other examples from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Seeing someone who is well-dressed or ‚Äúhas class‚Äù

\- Seeing/talking with someone powerful or famous

\- Being in proximity to attractive people

\- Watching someone engage in physical activities (e.g., sports)

\- Seeing someone act confidently

\- Seeing/talking with someone intelligent

\- Flirting with someone or having someone flirt with you

4.¬†Romantic/implicit cues¬†

These are intimate situations that just have that romantic vibe to them. Nagoski gave this example: ‚ÄúA woman in her 30s told me that she and her husband were saving up to remodel their bathroom, after they realized that a reason she was so keen for sex when they went on vacation was that they took long, hot (in every sense) baths together in the giant tubs at the B-and-Bs where they stayed. More baths, more sex.‚Äù

Some examples of the type of cue from McCall and Meston:¬†

\- Having your partner whisper into your ear or whispering into theirs

\- Dancing closely

\- Watching a sunset

\- Having a romantic dinner

\- Watching a romantic movie

\- Being in a hot tub

\- Touching your partner‚Äôs hair or face

\- Giving or receiving a massage

\- Laughing with your partner

\- Smelling pleasant scents (e.g., perfume/cologne, shampoo, aftershave)

Figuring out your ideal sexual context.¬†

How much each of these types of cues matter will depend on the individual. Some might be more important for you, while others might be less so. Couples‚Äô therapist¬†Alicia Mu√±oz, LPC, has a guided exercise for¬†figuring out your ideal sexual context.

‚ÄúSince most of us won‚Äôt stumble on a magic relationship lantern or sex genie in this lifetime,‚Äù she writes, ‚Äúconsciously understanding the different contextual factors‚Äîinternal and external‚Äîthat support and contribute to our personal experience of enjoyable sex is one of the most accessible and realistic paths to sexually empowering ourselves.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre someone who feels like they struggle with sexual desire, spend some time sitting and thinking through what contextual cues tend to make you feel turned on. Once you know what they are, you can focus on bringing more of those elements into your life so that you can access your desire whenever you want.

Not to mention, I was  h o r n y (freaked me out a little bit, my vag and clit area were so constantly aroused and sensitive, i had to masturbate several times a day to be able to focus on work!) 

Normally my period does not affect me that much, but this week was particularly brutal.

Cut to my therapist appointment. He asks me how I  am doing, I tell him I had a rough week. I think it best to pr√©cise that I was on a rough period, and that the natural hormonal cycle might be the main culprit. Nothing to worry about. 

Instead, he jumped on the period thing. He told the theory that my period made me depressed because it brought out a complex towards my feminity, my vaginism and my fertility. 

I tried to tell him that period may seem like a big symbolic deal to people that don't have it, but to women it's literally just a normal body fonction like bowel movements. Hormones impact our psychological state. 

But no, he was convinced my period brought out my subconscious trauma of my mother imposing her view of womanhood on me, and of my unhability to have vaginal intercourse. 

You know, at this point it is just funny to me how men are so estranged and borderline mesmerized by our periods üòÇ always trying to slap some big symbolism on it. Like bro, you're not psychoanalysing your self when you take a shit every morning, relax!

He also asked if it hurts because of my vaginism. Bruh, it's liquid ü§î it trickle downs.

yrbcj3,Healthyhooha,1668077195.0,"Just saw a post about someone testing positive for an STI (not syphilis) and it reminded me of this. 

I work in a doctors office and recently we‚Äôve had a spate of positive syphilis tests-repeat testing did show that the results were in error, more on that in a second. However, the patients who had positive results initially were shocked. The most recent 2 have been in long term, stable relationships- married for more than a decade, with children etc. so it caused some worry. Not clear what had them requesting testing in the first place, but some adults have really just never had a full STI panel done and it occasionally occurs to them. So we order it because it‚Äôs good information for people. 

We live in a small area, the Dept. of Health tracks things like this, and there‚Äôs been no outbreaks that we could find. So we got looking into it. 

Turns out that the typical standard test for syphilis, known as an RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin), is no longer suggested for use because of some cross-reactivity since COVID vaccines came out. I‚Äôm not anti-vax, it‚Äôs just a finding. We did retest all of our patients and none of them were actually positive. Four potential cases doesn‚Äôt sound like a lot, but in a small town, small clinic, it‚Äôs kind of a startling number and if it were true would absolutely initiate some department of health tracking. 

Anyway, if you‚Äôre going in for STI testing and have been vaccinated for COVID, please make sure your doctor orders a Treponema Pallidum Particle Agglutination test, abbreviated as TP-PA. 

Apparently the announcement from the CDC is almost a year old, but somehow it didn‚Äôt get a lot of press. At least not that our doctors had heard about. In fairness, since COVID, there‚Äôs been so many things shared so often that it‚Äôs possible it was and was missed. But if this post saves even one person from a false positive and some panic, it‚Äôs served purpose. Stay safe and healthy out there, y‚Äôall.

i60v2v,Healthyhooha,1596900146.0,"Hi! I swear this isn't some creepy guy trying to get your boob measurements lol this might be weird but my boobs are HEAVY and i wanted to know how heavy they were. I don't have anyone talk about this with but I hope this sub is cool with it.

&#x200B;

Honestly, at first I just tried to get level with my kitchen counter and plopped my boob on the scale but i felt like that wasn't really accurate, like i wonder if i was putting more/less weight on it depending on how i was oriented, etc. So I googled and found out about water displacement.

&#x200B;

I used [this method](https://www.forzasupplements.co.uk/blogs/fitness-wellbeing/how-to-weigh-breasts) but instead of using a tray, i just compared the weight of the full bowl vs the bowl after water displacement and subtracted the weight of the bowl itself (I put the bowl on the floor of my shower so it didn't go everywhere). Then you have to do a conversion where you multiply by 0.9 for the density of breast tissue but idk where they got that number from, I assume it differs with fat content vs muscle, but close enough! ... Anyway I was happy to finally know just how heavy my tatas are haha (about 500 g each (+/- 40 g), for reference I'm about an E cup -- well, since the edit I suppose they're more like 600+g).

&#x200B;

Here's my method if you wanna try it:

&#x200B;

\- Get a bowl thats big enough to put your entire boob into

\- Fill the bowl with water, to the rim! If there's less water than that, your results won't be accurate. Weigh the bowl, now full of water. You can fill it most of the way, set it on the scale, then get the rest of the water with a cup or something (it's hard to move a full bowl without spilling). Mark down the full bowl's weight. (This is number A, e.g. 3000g)

\- Go to your bathroom, put the bowl on your flat shower floor and stick your boob in lol. Water should be displacing from the bowl. Make sure you get your full boob in there.

\- Dry yourself off and weigh the bowl again with whats left in it. Mark it down, make sure you write down if it's the left or the right (Number B, e.g. 2200 g)

\- Fill the bowl again and do it again, but with the other boob. Dry yourself off and weigh whats left again, now marking the other number.  (Number C,  e.g. 2300 g)

&#x200B;

The math:

\- First, get the difference between the full bowl and the water-displaced bowl by subtracting A from B.

\- With my examples, this looks like: 3000-2200 = 800. This is the amount of water that you displaced. 

\- Now multiply by 0.9 for breast tissue density = 800 g \* 0.9 = 720 g. One boob is 720g!

\- For the other breast, do the same but with C and A.  3000-2300 = 700. . Now adjusted for breast tissue density, 500 * 0.9 = 630 g.

\- Your boobs are 720and 630g each!

&#x200B;

I hope that makes sense for you, I was always bad at math so please do correct me if this is wrong lol.

Edit: The original post said to weigh and subtract the empty bowl but this is not necessary: 
>You dont need to subtract the weight of the bowl. The bowl is a constant between both measurements, so the difference between the full bowl and the part empty bowl is just the weight of the water.

Hello reddit, my name is Fl√°via and I'm a 15 year old girl. I was always behind in developing compared to fellow girls. My height only 135 cm (4'5"") and my weight just 28,5 kg (63 ibs). I have so far have no signs of breast developing ever, no hair, armpits, pubic, no period.

I posted about the issue very concerned. My parents wanted test me for Turner syndrome but because of my age they were worried it is too late. Today I was taken in for gynaecology exam. What they found is: I will never have a period! The doctor looked at me, said ""Fl√°via, I do not know how to explain this to you. You will never have a period. Ever."" I was so heartbroken because like I was always behind, know I know that I will forever be behind. In the scan they find out: I do not have tubes, uterus, cervix, or vagina. But I do have ovaries, and they do not work well at all, they lack a function. I was diagnosed with what I think it is called Mayer Rokitansky Kuster Hauser syndrome.

Backstory: 
I only dated women for a few years and my vagina was pristine. I unexpectedly fell in love with a lovely man, unfortunately that‚Äôs when my problems started. 
The smell was bad and nothing would help. I peed after sex, washed my vulva with soap and water, scooped cum out with my fingers so it wouldn‚Äôt stay in there, drank water, went commando or wore cotton. I mostly eat fresh veggies, rice and lean proteins. I ferment my own veggies or regularly consume kimchi and yogurt. brag. 

And yet my discharge was like thin and metallic. Or fishy. Or just b.o. 

Truthfully I found it unbearable. There wasn‚Äôt anyone I felt I could go to. I was too poor to go to the doctor. I made him stop giving me head and just felt so worthless to be honest. Even now I actually still don‚Äôt do oral because I‚Äôm still dealing with feelings of shame. 

Anyways the solution was probiotics all along. Trader Joe‚Äôs general probiotic took away the smell immediately and then a Target woman‚Äôs health one really fixed me up. I just needed a more demons swimming around my vaginal walls or however scientists say that. I make the bf take a mens one too.

I forgot to pick it up and when my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he suddenly rushes out again. I go ‚ÄûWhat‚Äôs wrong?‚Äú. So he says ‚ÄûYou forgot something on the floor, can you pick it up?‚Äú in an annoyed tone.

So I get up and there lies the small paper-plastic thing. I‚Äòm shocked: I‚Äòve never left something behind before. This is kinda embarrassing...

I did a home STI test for Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis and HIV. This is just for routine testing but I put it off for a while because I didn't want to pay. I found out the government provided free testing kits and I signed up immediately. 10 days later I receive a text confirming I'm positive for only Chlamydia. 

Eventhough I'm a medical student and I understood what the infection is I still had a panic attack which ended up with a migraine. I felt ""dirty"" eventhough I knew I should think that way. I felt like I should've been extra careful even when I used condoms. It felt like a huge blow to my character and the anxiety of telling my current and ex partners from the last 3months made me feel more and more anxious.

 But in the end, I did the right thing. I notified the nearest hospital to book an appointment for treatment and notified my sexual contacts how to get tested and treated. 3 of them told me it's not my fault and they were proud that I told them. My current partner is supportive is getting treatment on Monday. Only 1 partner did not react well and shamed me for the result. I received my Doxycycline tablets today and I'll be taking the drug for a week and abstaining from sex for 2 weeks.

I cried during my consultation with the nurse. She told me that she's proud of what I did and everything will be okay. She told me I can still have a happy sexual life. I told her my concerns and she gladly booked me for a curative test in 5weeks to give me peace of mind and for my partner as well because he wants me to enjoy sex without the anxiety.

jg1v6g,Periods,1603380862.0,"My husband and I always planned on having kids someday, but at the time, we weren‚Äôt ready for it. We weren‚Äôt very financially secure, and we were renting. We wanted to have a house of our own first. Our birth control method started with me on the pill and us using the pull out method, but after multiple complications, switches of BC types, and 3 ER visits, I decided to stop taking it and we would use the pull out method alone. The pull out method worked great for us. We never had any accidents for years. 

I ended up getting a little bit of baby rabies. As embarrassing as it is, I‚Äôm not going to lie about it. It happened. Idk why, but something in my body just screamed ‚Äúprocreate!‚Äù It got worse whenever I was ovulating. One time while my husband and I were having sex, I asked him not to pull out. I meant it kind of half serious/half joking. I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd actually do it. Well he did. It was super close to my ovulation, I believe I was on day 13 of my cycle, and my cycles were always a little off (not always 28 days, sometimes shorter, sometimes longer) so within three hours after we had sex, we went to the drug store and I got and took Plan B. 

Flash forward to the time of my expected period. There was no blood, but I felt all the other symptoms of my period. Cramps, lower back pain, tender breasts, headaches. I fully felt like I was on my period, there was just no blood. I figured that was because of the Plan B. * insert sarcastic laugh * 

About a week and a half later, my husband and I went on a small trip a few hours away with my dad so they could pick up some equipment for one of their mutual hobbies. On the way home, we stopped for lunch at a really cool oyster bar. My dad and I had been there multiple times and I got what I always ordered. After we left, I felt sick to my stomach for the first time after having this meal, and I ended up dead tired and passing out in the car. When we finally got home, my stomach was incredibly upset and I thought I had food poisoning. I was so tired and sick. 

The upset stomach went away within 24 hours, but I was still so fricken tired all the time. I ended up passing out while sitting in my car in a parking lot on a 98¬∞F day. I have pernicious anemia, and thought it was because I was due for my B12 shot soon. Nope. 

The final straw for me was when I went to go make a salad a few days later. I love spinach. I opened up the container of just-bought spinach and nearly vomited from the smell. It smelled absolutely horrible. If you‚Äôve ever opened up a container of spinach that‚Äôs about to go bad and you can kind of smell it -it was like that but x 100. I was gagging and almost vomited as I searched this crisp, fresh spinach for rot. My husband came in and smelled it, and said he couldn‚Äôt smell anything. 

The next day, I took 3 pregnancy tests. And sure enough, on every single one, there was a faint positive line. I made an appointment with my doctor to get a blood test done for confirmation. I was 5-6 weeks pregnant. Turns out, Plan B doesn‚Äôt work if you are already ovulating. 

I considered abortion, but as we were already planning on having kids, it didn‚Äôt go any further than some discussion between my husband and I, and I/we decided to go through with it. We had 9 months to get our shit in order, and we did. And now we have a beautiful 9 month old daughter. 

Figured I‚Äôd post this here for anyone wanting to read a real life experience if they are late/have a missed period, took emergency contraceptive, and thinks they might be pregnant.



Edit: I guess a lot of people are shocked to find out that Plan B doesn‚Äôt work if you take it while you‚Äôre ovulating. I found out when I talked to my doctor about me taking it and inquired about it potentially hurting the baby. She told me it won‚Äôt harm anything if you‚Äôre already pregnant, won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre ovulating(because it prevents ovulation from happening, can‚Äôt do that if it already happened), and that if you‚Äôre above a certain weight (I can‚Äôt remember what weight it was) it will not be very effective and some women would have to take two doses.

Apparently being on antivirals and using condoms can lower the risk of giving it to another person, but it's still there. And I guess there are a lot of people who have the virus and don't even know because they've never had an outbreak.  

Truth is, I like this guy but I don't think he's gonna be my person. If I met someone and I'd feel like they could be it, I could live with the fact that there's always gonna be the risk of them giving it to me. But right now I feel like for something lowkey, casual it's just not worth it.

mkoty6,TwoXSupport,1617640550.0,"My (29) brother (31) has changed a lot over the last few years, and not for the better. He's taken a turn for the misogynistic, and borders on being a 'Nice Guy'.

We had our Easter dinner last night, and we were all just sitting around talking. My sister (26) brings up that her friend had just gone through a bad breakup, and was talking about how the ex was overly clingy, and emotionally manipulative (fabricating situations to use against the friend). My brother was silently listening, and when she was done explaining the extent of this guy's behaviour, my brother chimes in and says

""He sounds like a woman.""

We froze, and just stared at him for a second. No one knew how to respond. He had been leaning towards that line of thinking for a while now, but had never said anything that overt before. It was almost surreal.

My sister snapped out of it first, looked him dead in the eye and very curtly said

""Well that was inappropriate.""

She broke the spell, and we were able to address his statement. Both my sister and I expressed that none of our female friends behave that way, and that honestly, the only experience either of us had had with that behaviour had been from *men*.

Surprisingly, it didn't turn into a whole thing. There was no yelling or screaming, no food thrown, or flared tempers. He seemed genuinely surprised that that was our experience, and we were able to get him to conclude that he's just talking to the wrong women.

I am *extremely* proud of my sister. She's always been the type to speak up, but I had never actually witnessed it myself (I am not close to either of my siblings for reasons), and I just had to share it.

1. Trying to understand my husband's viewpoint
2. Am I wrong?

I'm 35 been married for 11 years have 2 kids. I have an active sex life with my husband and orgasm most the time during sex. Throughout our relationship (since I was 17) I have occasionally masterbated, but my husband didn't know. Over the course of our 18 years together, this topic has come up in the past when after having sex and me not having an orgasm. He would accuse me of masterbating. Most the time it was not the case, I had not and would say no. I caught on that this was an insecurity of his, so anytime I ever did do the thing, I never told him about it and throughout the years if he ever mentioned it, I would always deny it. Recently I took a job out of town where I am in a different state M-F. We have sex every weekend, because he feels unloved if we don't (yes many layers of issues here I know, stay with me) I decided to buy a vibrator to use sometimes when I was out of town. My husband ended up walking in on a conversation I was having with my best friend about it, found the vibrator and freak out a few months ago. I thought we got past it, I explained my reasons behind having it etc. Tonight he brings up that he cannot get over me having it and  me wanting to self pleasure and why can't I just wait for him on the weekend, etc. He is so angry about it that he states it is causing him anxiety depression and that I'm acting wierd. I truly feel like I've done nothing wrong by having it, it doesn't make me not have sex with him, I don't feel like it's wrong to self pleasure, yet he is making me feel like I'm doing something wrong and terrible and hurting him.

I had tried waxing myself a few times in the past few years and it was painful! At the time, I hadn‚Äôt been to a salon, so my hair was thick and coarse from shaving. 

Luckily, right before social distancing guidelines, I was diligent about making sure my hooha would be ready for summer time bikini lines! But of course, one week after my second wax, salons and such were closed. 

I‚Äôd been letting myself grow out, refusing to go back to shaving and undo the work - and money - I‚Äôd put into this self love project. But I‚Äôd finally had enough. I went out and purchased some Nair Ready - Strips and decided to do the deed myself. 

A shot of vodka and three ibuprofen later, I‚Äôm smooth as a baby‚Äôs bottom! 

Luckily, the two prior salon visits must‚Äôve helped in thinning the hairs and making removal much simpler than it had been in the past. Wasn‚Äôt nearly as painful or time consuming. 

If I can keep this up, I could save myself $50/3-6 weeks!

kr5k6s,WomensHealth,1609874571.0,"I‚Äôm absolutely sobbing as I write this:

I(19) have had over 15 yeast infections and 5 BV cases within the past two years and I am so fucking tired of feeling broken. I eat yogurt everyday, I wear cotton undies, I drink water and take probiotics, I shower after sex and I sleep commando! I don‚Äôt take antibiotics and I don‚Äôt eat a lot of sugar.

I think my first few yeast infections were caused by friction with condoms, but it didn‚Äôt start happening till almost a year after I became sexually active. My boyfriend and I used condoms for two years (yes every time), but we didn‚Äôt like the fact that everything would smell like latex and probably leave some latex particles inside of me, probably fueling the infections. 

So after suffering through almost 10 yeast infections in a year, we decided to try birth control. Due to my history of mental health issues, we ruled out the pill as it can effect depression symptoms. After talking to my doctors and my cousin who is a women health doctor, we decided the Kyleena IUD would be best. 

After that I was free from yeast infections for four months, but I had Bacterial Vaginosis and treated it with boric acid. About two months ago my boyfriend and I decided to be abstinent for a whole cycle. A month went by and I had no infection. My first month free in over a year. 

This past few weeks we decided since I was in the clear, we could try again. The times we did it were totally fine and the most enjoyable sex I‚Äôve had in a while because I wasn‚Äôt afraid of the itching or burning. 

About four days ago, I started itching and the next morning had yeast infection discharge. I am crushed. I literally cannot win. So I went to cvs and got monistat and I‚Äôm on my final day now yet it‚Äôs still a little itchy (and now it‚Äôs starting to smell what the fuck) I‚Äôve gone to the doctor so many times for my vagina and no one is helping me. The just prescribe me fluconazole and tell me to be on my way. 

Why do I feel like I‚Äôm being punished?! I am loyal to my boyfriend, I have safe sex, and I‚Äôm with a good guy. How come I have to be punished every time I have sex?! I feel like shit and I will never get over these stupid fucking reoccurring infections.

I‚Äôve been through the bv, antibiotics, yeast infection, diflucan, back to bv cycle so many times that I had pretty much given up hope and accepted celibacy after breaking up with my long term boyfriend. Even after we broke up, I tried antibiotics one more time, bought all new underwear and didn‚Äôt even masturbate and it came back with a vengeance two weeks later. I had heard about boric acid so I found this subreddit through my searches and decided, what would it hurt. The bottle of 30 capsules I got was $6. I inserted one every night for a week. Within three days there was no smell and my color had returned to light pink from red (which I haven‚Äôt seen in years). It‚Äôs been 3 weeks since my last dose and nothing has returned. 

TMI warning! 
I know this is probably graphic but my chronic bv sisters will understand why this is such a big deal. I masturbated recently and my toys smelled like NOTHING afterwards. Like literally smelled unused. I‚Äôm so happy and I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt try this years ago. If you‚Äôre dealing with bv, do yourself and your lady bits a favor and just TRY IT ALREADY. 

Also just a disclaimer....do some reading, but even if this is the only post you read, boric acid is safe for vaginal insertion but DO NOT TAKE IT ORALLY. It can cause kidney damage among other things. I had a slight discharge (some women have reported they had a ton while using boric acid) but no irritation or the horrible symptoms from antibiotics.

158xx3g,Healthyhooha,1690260225.0,"I (21 F) tought I had a yeast infection a few days ago. I used an over the counter three day treatment. It did help a bit but I was not fully healed. So yesterday I woke up and started to feel really bad. I called off work and went to an urgent care. I felt so bad I could barely focus when talking to the receptionist. It was the type of pain where you can barely sit still. After being seen by a nurse practitioner it turned out to be an UTI. The nurse practitioner said, ‚ÄúLooks like you have a pretty good UTI.‚Äù I was prescribed an antibiotic and something to help prevent a yeast infection.

Later the night I was using the restroom and felt what seemed like a tampon string. I than pulled out one. I was in shock. I had not used a tampon that day or even that week. I had no recollection of using a tampon in a long time. 
After a good hour of shock and this unnerving feeling of not trusting my own memory. I texted my boyfriend (22) about what just happened. 

The pieces started coming together. 
For context: I have never had a regular period. I was changing Birth-controlls. 

A little over a month ago (June 15-17)  my bf and I went on a camping trip with friends. This was the kind of drinking/getting high sort of camping. I had some break through bleeding from recently changing Birthcontrols. I used tampons during this trip. 

When we got back home and had sex he didn‚Äôt want to go down on me. He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry but it smells‚Äù 

I understood and didn‚Äôt think much of it. I chopped it up to changing birth-control or something. Physically I felt fine. I also don‚Äôt have a good sense of smell period. So I wasn‚Äôt smelling what he was.

My bf and I have been having sex this past month. I have had some discomforts but didn‚Äôt think much of it. Until now it all makes sense. After I told him this and we put the pieces together he said, ‚Äúlast time I thought I felt something but sometimes I know you use those menstrual cups and don‚Äôt say anything so I though it was that‚Äù Which is true we will have sex while I am using a menstrual cup. I don‚Äôt always say something about it because I don‚Äôt want to ruin the moment.

okzqzx,WomensHealth,1626376482.0,"I get it. I truly cannot express to you how much I get it. I'm a forever recovering hypochondriac and getting this vaccine was really hard for me.

I get that it feels like it was rushed. I get that its difficult feeling like the government always has your best interest at heart (depending where you live.) Which is why I choose to listen to the doctors and the scientists and not politicians regarding the safety and efficacy of this vaccine. I'm mostly going to talk about the mRNA vaccines because I feel those are the ones people are most skeptical of.

And, a disclaimer here. I do not work in the medical field. I am simply trying to gather up the information we do have in one place and present it in a way that feels demystified. I feel confident the information here is accurate, but welcome any corrections because I'm only one lay person! And if you have any questions about what is presented here, or are still just curious or have doubts, I definitely encourage you to bring it up with your doctor!

**tl;dr - The COVID vaccines have gone through the exact same rigorous safety and efficacy evaluations as any other FDA approved drug. It's been able to move faster because it has been a priority to every government in the world, so massive amounts of resources and attention have been directed to their development, and have been moved to the top of the pile of drugs waiting for FDA evaluation and approval. Also, mRNA vaccines are a decades old technology and have been deployed in clinical trials for other viruses and some cancers years ago.**

**How these vaccines work**

A small piece of the virus's DNA sequence is essentially programed into a synthetic messenger RNA. mRNA works in our bodies to deliver instructions for what proteins to make. Our own mRNA and the synthetic stuff only lives in your body for a few days, and the proteins being produced are only produced for a few weeks.

So these vaccines deliver the instructions required for our own bodies to make the famous spike protein of the coronavirus. The vaccine itself is only in your body for a few days, and the spike proteins your body makes only last for a few weeks while your body figures out how to destroy the spike proteins. Then your body remembers this for next time it comes into contact with this, and similar, spike proteins. These are the antibodies (and T cells etc.)

**Regarding Efficacy**

The mRNA vaccines have been proven to be extremely effective at preventing COVID 19 and preventing severe disease. They are even being proven effective at preventing symptomatic disease with the variants, including Delta, though at a slightly less efficacy.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2035389)

Moderna's phase III trials of their original formulation showed a 94.1% efficacy at preventing disease, and nearly 100% effective at preventing severe disease. They recently came out saying their original formulation is still 93% effective 6 months later.

Pfizer showed in their phase III trials that their original formulation was 95% effective at protecting against symptomatic disease, and nearly 100% effective at preventing severe disease. These rates have also fallen, to being about 83.7% effective 6 months later.

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa2034577)

I want to be clear though, these are still some of the most effective vaccines in history. For reference, the flu vaccine every year confers anywhere from 40-60% efficacy, but would be higher if more people got the flu vaccine.

I also want to address some people's worries about breakthrough infections. Most vaccines are actually formulated to prevent *disease,* not *infection.* Creating a vaccine that prevents infection is called 'sterilizing immunity' which is really hard to do, and few vaccines actually do that. We expect breakthrough infections to happen to some degree, and these are still some of the most protective vaccines in history. And again, the efficacy rate improves as more people get vaccinated.

That all being said, The Mayo Clinic just a released a pre peer reviewed study on the effectiveness of both vaccines on the Delta variant. It appears Pfizer's efficacy has dropped down to 42% and Moderna's to 76% in July when the Delta variant became the dominant variant. These results suggest the FDA may soon recommend boosters.

**Regarding Safety**

So here's where I think most people are finding issue. It feels like the vaccine was rushed, and I completely agree! It *feels* that way, but if we break down the whole process and everything leading up to this point, we can see all of these vaccines have gone through the exact same protocol as every other vaccine on the market.

1. To start with, mRNA vaccines are not new. We've been developing this technology for decades and have even previously deployed mRNA vaccines in clinical trials for other viruses such as Zika and cytomegalovirus, as well as certain cancers. Why those vaccines have not been FDA approved ultimately comes down to funding and demand.

[https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/01/zika-mrna-vaccine-enters-clinical-trial-angola-reports-cases](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2017/01/zika-mrna-vaccine-enters-clinical-trial-angola-reports-cases)

2. My next point is funding. COVID vaccine developers have been absolutely flooded with funding from governments around the world as well as individual donors, because everyone has a vested interest in ending this pandemic. Typically when scientists want to conduct research or develop a new technology, they need to take the time to apply for grants and approach investors to prove that the advancement is both needed and that their approach is viable. That was obviously not needed for these vaccines; we all agree they're needed and we've known mRNA vaccines are viable. Immediately having all the resources necessary is a huge boon for developers and pushes the timeline even faster.

3. And since everyone is interested in ending this pandemic, governments all over the world have temporarily relaxed typical protocols for sharing information across borders. (It would be cool if this were permanent but that's probably unlikely). Thousands of scientists all over the world dropped what they were doing and worked around the clock to come together to work on these vaccines. Normally it may just be like a dozen people in one country working towards an end goal, but with this free flowing information and collaborative effort, the timeline was again pushed faster.

4. We also have to remember technological advancement continues to accelerate. The technology we have now even compared to 10 years ago is immeasurable, and sequencing the entire genome of any organism takes no time at all. And since we already had the mRNA technology ready to go, it took almost no time to just plug in that chosen DNA sequence and get started on clinical trials. Truly, we had this vaccine basically ready to go, we just needed to sequence theDNA of SARS-CoV2 and choose an appropriate protein.

5. We also have been studying coronaviruses for over 50 years. Though SARS-CoV2 itself is a novel virus, its very similar to SARS-CoV1, which we have been studying since its outbreak in 2002, and could even use information from the MERS outbreak in 2012. Basically, we already understood this virus's structure, genome and lifecycle. It's not like we were starting from scratch.

**Clinical Trials and FDA approval**

So this brings me to clinical trials. Every single COVID vaccine (in the US) has to go through the exact same protocols as every other vaccine on the market today. No steps were skipped or rushed. The guidelines are as follows;

1. Pre Clinical Trials, where the vaccine is first tested on animals
2. A lab submits an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA, where the FDA reviews the results from the Pre Clinical Trials
3. Upon approval, a lab inspection is then scheduled and conducted to make sure the lab is in accordance to Good Laboratory Practices, a set of practices that has been established since the FDA's inception
4. The FDA also inspects the vaccines materials and the manufacturing technology for quality and safety
5. Phase 1 Clinical Trials: the vaccine is tested on 20-100 healthy adults for 2 months
6. Phase 2 Clinical Trials: based on the safety and efficacy shown in Stage 1, the vaccine is tested one hundreds more adults of varying health statuses and demographics for 2 months
7. Phase 3 Clinical Trials, where the vaccine is used on thousands of people where we can get an even better idea of common and rare side effects in the general population. this section is also 2 months long
8. The manufacturing process is again assessed to determine quality and safety of large scale production of the vaccine
9. Seeking Approval to distribute and market in the US. The benefits and risks of the vaccine are weighed, and the decision is reviewed by a team of experts including doctors, chemists, statisticians, manufacturing and facility experts, pharmacologists, toxicologists, microbiologists, experts in postmarketing safety, clinical study site inspectors, and labeling and communications experts. This is where we are now in waiting to get the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines FDA approved. Though this process needs to be reviewed by a lot of people, and that takes a lot of time, it is being prioritized right now
10. The FDA and respective labs continue to follow up with trial participants for years and the FDA regularly inspects and regulates the labs making the vaccine for quality, efficacy and safety

[https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/development-approval-process-cber/vaccine-development-101)

**The vaccine was not rushed, it was** ***prioritized***

Much of the time historically spent getting vaccines developed and approved is more or less waiting time. There's all kinds of bureaucratic hoops to jump through, there's normally more obstacles by way of funding, information sharing, limited man power, and limited interest. Massive amounts of resources were simply funneled into this endeavor and developers aren't having to submit their applications to a long pile of other applications waiting to be approved. COVID vaccine development has been prioritized by everyone, so its just been moving through the technical and legal slog more quickly.

**What we know about vaccines**

So why is each phase of clinical trials 2 months long? Because we know it is *extremely* rare to experience vaccine side effects beyond 6-8 weeks. That is accepted as the rule, and any exceptions to that rule are so rare they are simply case studies. We have deployed mRNA vaccines years ago in trials for other viruses, and long term side effects have not been reported

[https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243)

It is also literally *impossible* for a vaccine to cause a side effect that the disease itself cannot cause, besides of course, allergy to a vaccine ingredient. COVID itself made me skip my period and then I had awful awful PMS symptoms for months after, and so far the COVID vaccine has made my period a bit irregular, but it is not forever. I have friends who are healthcare workers and got the vaccine in November, and their cycles have all returned to normal within 6 months. Any strong immune response or trauma can effect your menstrual cycle. Your reproductive system is meant to be adaptable, because you're body doesn't want you to get pregnant under stressful conditions. This isn't proven but if I had to guess, part of the reason our bodies are reacting in SUCH an inflammatory manner to COVID and the vaccines is because its a completely foreign invader. We haven't had regular exposures to this virus for our entire lifetime, so it has to deploy all weapons in its arsenal to figure out what works best. Most other pathogens, we've had some practice

We know the vaccine doesn't cause infertility because then we would be seeing COVID itself causing infertility. Which has not been the case.

Blood clots, Guillain Barre and heart inflammation are all rare side effects of the vaccine, but you're more likely to get them if you get COVID. Heck, you're more likely to get blood clots from your birth control than the vaccine.

**Conclusion**

I know that this likely isn't going to change anyone's minds who are vehemently anti-vax or anti-COVID vax. But I know some people are just nervous about the whole thing but *want* some more information and reassurance, so I hope this feels reassuring in some way. It's also unfortunate many of our governments havent been very communicative during this whole process and are now just expecting people to willingly put something that *feels* so foreign and unstudied in our bodies. Thankfully, we do actually know a lot about these vaccines and how theyre working in our bodies. And hopefully it is reassuring to know that these vaccines *have* gone through the exact same rigorous testing and evaluation as all other drugs on the (US) market.

iz11in,TwoXSupport,1600966642.0,"I'm 10 weeks pregnant and it's so infuriating to see the crap that men write on various pregnancy-related posts on some of the bigger subreddits (AITA, relationship\_advice, etc.). I know that these subreddits can be shitty toxic places, but whenever I see a post related to pregnancy, I can't help but get a little curious as to what people are saying on it, and sure enough, it's almost always cis men who know nothing about what it's like to be pregnant or have a child judging a pregnant woman.

Did anybody else see the post on AITA a week or two ago where people were saying that the OP wasn't the asshole when he froze his pregnant wife's credit card (literally committing financial abuse) because she was ordering sushi and Subway off of meal delivery services to satisfy cravings, and he believed that since her (male!) doctor said no sushi or deli meats, she was behaving like horribly irresponsible child and needed to be controlled? It was horrifying to see how many men agreed with this guy and were so vehemently opposed even considering the opinions that women were posting in defense of the pregnant wife (including that the doctor's advice is outdated and that it's all about deciding what you consider too risky based on actual data, not knee jerk reactions like ""OMG SUSHI IS BAD. YOU'LL KILL BABY IF YOU EAT HAM."") I mean really, who knows more about pregnancy, men who have never been pregnant (most of whom haven't even had a pregnant partner) or women who have been pregnant? Why would you even argue? Driving is far more risky for a pregnant woman and her baby than having a Subway sandwich! Hell, I bet that data would be in favor of the statement that being in a relationship with a man is more risky for a pregnant woman than a Subway sandwich based on how common it is for domestic violence to start to happen or ramp up during or directly after pregnancy.

A lot of women brought up the book ""Expecting Better"" by Emily Oster, which is a book that I've found very helpful in determining what risks I'm willing to take in pregnancy so I can still feel like an autonomous human and not like an incubator (something that my husband is 100% in support of. He understands that it's my body and I'm an adult who's able to make safe, well-informed decisions for myself and our child), and a bunch of men would jump on them and point out the Oster is ""aN eCoNoMiSt, NoT a DoCtOr"", so nobody should listen to her. Oster clearly states that she's an economist, not a doctor, and the whole point of the book is that she's an economist who's great at research, so she presents the research and data related to these topics to make women more informed about how risky certain things are so they can make their own well-informed decisions. I may not be a doctor, but I know how to do my own research and make my own well-informed decisions, thank you very much.

There was also that AITA post from a few days ago where a woman's husband had been unemployed due to COVID and was the primary caregiver for their young child when he suddenly started ""just having a feeling"" (literally, no other evidence to speak of) that his son wasn't his and requesting a paternity test from her despite the son clearly being his. There were men saying that SHE was gaslighting HIM by telling him that she would only consider getting the test if he went to therapy, because she was concerned that he was having a mental health crisis (which makes complete sense since this was coming from out of left field and a total shift in personality). They wouldn't even admit that it was alright for this woman to feel hurt and offended that her husband was essentially claiming that she had cheated and is committing paternity fraud. Absolutely ridiculous.

Has anybody else noticed this trend and does it piss anybody else off?

Thank you for letting me vent!

  
EDIT TO ADD: ALSO, to all of the posts about men who seem to be acting strangely after their wife gives birth: No, cis men by definition CANNOT have postpartum depression.

I was terrified and thought I was the rare unlucky person to get an STD without ever having had sex. My mom always came in the doctors office with me and I was too scared to bring it up. Finally, one day I got to go to the doctor by myself. I was nervous but forced myself to ask about it because these suckers were HUGE. They were recurring and would fill up with pus and blood. Itchy, painful, and then they would burst. After bursting the wound remained open which was even more painful because my undies would rip the scabs as they formed. 

At that time, my doctor told me to take baths mixed with a little bit of bleach and ordered me an ointment (clindamyacin) to help them heal faster.


As I got older, the severity of the bumps/boils/carbuncles decreased dramatically but the frequency did not. I get them all the time now, on my labia majora as well as my inner thighs (the ones on my inner thighs don‚Äôt burst and they are hard. They slowly go away). 

It‚Äôs really frustrating and uncomfortable and embarrassing sometimes. I have never really found a solution or help for this issue. As a matter of fact, I was today years old when I found out it had a name: Hidradenitis suppurativa. The only reason I know that is from this sub!!

t0ttzx,WomensHealth,1645760206.0,"I (26f, US) found out 9 years ago that I had a small 1.7cm nodule on my thyroid. I immediately had it biopsied and it was benign. I was advised by my PCP that I should have it removed at some point to avoid the risk of cancer in the future. I had met with a surgeon who retired before my second appointment. My next surgeon retired before my first appointment. We were having trouble finding another surgeon so my PCP advised I just have regular ultrasounds done in order to keep an eye on it.

I had ultrasounds every 3 years or so and began seeing an ENT/Surgeon a year ago. My ultrasound last year showed that my nodule had grown to 4cm and that I had another large one at 2.8cm and multiple other small ones all over my thyroid. The ultrasound also showed that my nodules had become solid while they were previously fluid-filled.

I asked my ENT if he would remove the nodules. Based on their rapid growth and my trouble breathing, it seemed like the logical answer. He denied my request and stated that my thyroid hormone levels from my recent blood work was normal so surgery would be unnecessary. I pushed him and said that I would like to have the surgery before I was removed from my parent's no-deductible insurance plan in a year. He told me that ""losing your insurance isn't a reason to have a surgery.""

I thought to my myself: funny, maybe it isn't a reason for YOU and the funds you have. For the rest of us who don't have a disposable income and live in this medical debt hellscape that is the US, it can sometimes be the only chance we'll get to have proper medical care.

He prescribed speech therapy for my breathing problems and that I get an ultrasound and come back in a year. The speech therapist found nothing wrong with my vocal chords and agreed that he probably prescribed it to satiate my request for care. 

Fast forward to now, I had my yearly ultrasound and my nodules have grown again. I have one 4.6cm, 3.8cm and multiple 1-2cm nodules. Again my ENT did not see any issue. I had to beg him just to prescribe a biopsy this time. The results came back and what would you know, I have a high chance of having thyroid cancer! My ENT read the results and said that malignancy is likely.

I met with him again a few days ago to discuss surgery, which he finally wants to do of course. I asked him about the cost  and he told me not to worry about it; that insurance would cover it. I reminded him that my insurance with my parent ends on the 1st and that my new insurance with work has a 4k deductible. He scoffed and said, ""well you'll definitely be meeting your deductible with this surgery!""

I'm not too worried about the cancer, everything I've read says that thyroid cancer is very treatable. I'm just extremely stressed about the medical debt I'm going to be saddled with all because my doctor wouldn't listen to me a year ago. I am going to a hospital nearby that specializes in cancer care to discuss having my surgery there. I tried advocating for myself and my health but my doctor continuously wrote me off.

odf4a0,Periods,1625381674.0,"I started my period when I was 12 and I‚Äôm 42 now. Here are some things I‚Äôve learned. I hope it‚Äôs helpful to someone. This is just my experience and my point of view, and I know not everyone will be able to follow this advice because of their life circumstances.¬≠¬≠ If anyone else has any tips I'd love to hear them.

&#x200B;

1. If over-the-counter painkillers are not enough to make your periods pain-free, talk to a doctor ‚Äì more than one if need be. When I was young, doctors told me that period pain was part of being a woman. I wish I‚Äôd told them that treating pain is part of being a doctor. It wasn‚Äôt until I was 27 that I was prescribed proper pain relief ‚Äì first of all Mefenamic Acid and now Naproxen (I‚Äôm in the UK). If I take them at the right time, my periods can be almost pain-free.
2. Stress creates tension in the body, which can worsen pain. My period pain is a very sensitive barometer of how stressed I am, e.g. my pain is always worse if I‚Äôm at work rather than at home in bed. The day I move city I had some of the worst period pain of my life, and sometimes if I feel myself getting stressed about something, I can feel my period pain getting worse at the same time. If you get bad period pain, it might be worth thinking about what you can do to make your life less stressful or even stress-free. Everyone‚Äôs different but here were some of the things I did to reduce my stress: running, meditation, working part-time, working from home, moving to the countryside, having therapy.
3. Prepare for your period. This is an easy way to take some of the hassle out of periods. Devote a drawer or shelf to period paraphernalia and make sure you always have plenty of painkillers, tampons/sanitary towels, pants, heat pads, chocolate, magazines ‚Äì whatever you need to get through it. If you know your period is due, sleep on a towel for a couple of nights ‚Äì having to wash your sheets is going to make you resent your period even more. If your period is regular and painful, keep your diary as clear as possible for the days when you are likely to be in pain.
4. When you‚Äôre in pain, you need to take care of yourself. It doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs ‚Äújust‚Äù your period, that it happens every month, that some other women‚Äôs periods are easy. A body in pain needs care. If you want to cancel social plans, do it ‚Äì no guilt, you are in pain. I‚Äôve called in sick to every job I‚Äôve ever had because of period pain and my managers have only ever been sympathetic. I‚Äôm in the UK and I know some countries are less tolerant of sick leave, but if your manager wants you to work when you‚Äôre in pain (which will probably make your pain worse) think about whether you want to work for them. If you live with someone and it feels appropriate, ask them to help you: to bring you a hot drink or a hot water bottle or to make dinner.
5. It‚Äôs commonly said that pain x resistance = suffering. In other words, the more we resist our pain, the more we suffer. I agree with this because I experience it every month with my period. If I tense up against my pain, get angry with it, hate it, try to push it away, thrash around, scream and shout, it makes the pain much worse. If I‚Äôm able to stop resisting it and relax my body, the pain lessens. If I‚Äôm able to take it one step further and embrace the pain (so, the opposite of resisting) it lessens even more. By embracing it I mean that I imagine the pain like a visitor that I‚Äôm welcoming and embracing. It sounds odd but it‚Äôs a well-known method of pain management - it's just very hard to do.
6. There is still a lot of taboo and secrecy around periods, which makes having a period infinitely harder. Try being honest with people when you cancel plans/call in sick and say it‚Äôs because of your period, rather than making something up. If people hear it enough times from enough people it will stop being taboo and we can all relax a little more instead of having to pretend that periods don‚Äôt exist.
7. PMS (mood swings and other symptoms in the week or two before your period) can also be exacerbated by stress. My personal experience is that hormones + stress = PMS. If you experience bad PMS and you feel your moods are out of control, again it might be worth looking into ways to reduce stress in your life. I used to get extreme PMS, because I was extremely stressed, and since I made the changes listed above I rarely experience PMS, and if I do I can usually pinpoint what's stressing me. Remember you don‚Äôt have to have a high-powered job or seven kids to be stressed ‚Äì some of us find ordinary life very stressful.
8. Periods are crap but they can teach us a lot about self-care. Every month our period challenges us to take care of ourselves ‚Äì can we do it? Can we admit that we‚Äôre suffering and let ourselves rest? Can we put ourselves first, even for just a few days? Can we be honest with people and ask for help? Self-care is extremely difficult for some of us, but it‚Äôs one of the most important life skills we can learn.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/odf4a0/what_ive_learned_from_30_years_of_periods/,What I've learned from 30 years of periods,Discussion,221,30,1.0,Youknowkitties

For the past 6 months I have started to suffer from repeated bv, yeast infections, and UTIs that sometimes had no symptoms. After seeing different gynecologists and getting no answers on why this was happening to me, I made an appointment with a urogynecologist. They took a direct sample of my urine via catheter, and while he was examining me asked me if I ever had a baby and if I‚Äôm on bc. Apparently I have discoloration from a vaginal tear. 

He said that bc I‚Äôve been on birth control for 6 years without stopping, my estrogen is extremely low and that‚Äôs what has been causing the urethra discomfort and vaginal discomfort and tearing from sex. Apparently that can also make you prone to UTIs because it thins the skin of the urethra. 

I am to get off birth control for 3 months, and apply an estrogen cream 3 times a week. Also boric acid for a month for the infections.

The infection started when I was in eighth grade, I just graduated college AND I AM STILL DEALING WITH THIS FUCKING THING. I seriously think after this many years and different treatments that my vagina is ruined. Infertile at the very least. I have tried so many different treatments, from antibiotics to probiotic suppositories to boric acid (which is what I have been using for the past seven years so that I can live a semi-normal life). All the regular advice I have heard a million times, no douching, cotton underwear, don‚Äôt let a guy cum inside. The smell always comes back. I didn‚Äôt even lose my virginity until I was 21 and have only had sex twice in my entire life, a big part of the reason being because of this. I am pretty sure I will never be able to get a boyfriend because of this also, like how do I explain this to a guy? Anyway, to keep symptoms at bay I regularly use boric acid which is something else I have to worry about because I don‚Äôt know the long-term side effects and I am so scared I am going to get cancer down the road from sticking boric acid up my vagina for literally the past seven years. It is the only thing that will get rid of symptoms overnight! Even though it come back within 1-2 days.

Sorry for the rant, I have just been realizing lately that I am probably going to be miserably dealing with this for the rest of my life. I haven‚Äôt even really lived life yet. I can‚Äôt do things spontaneously like take road trips or have sex. I am so fucking scared that I am going to get cancer from the boric acid and that I may be alone for the rest of my life because no one wants to date a girl with a broken & smelly vagina. I just wish this hadn‚Äôt happened to me. I visited a gynecologist recently and she has prescribed me a course of vaginal metronidazole that I am going to use following my next period, followed by insertion of a probiotic suppository every night. She also prescribed me long term metronidazole to take 1-2 times a week after my initial course. I can‚Äôt get my hopes up but it‚Äôs the best option I have right now.

I don‚Äôt even know what I am looking for with posting this. I can‚Äôt really talk to anyone in my life about it and I know recurrent BV is a big problem on this sub, so I thought maybe you guys might listen to me. Anybody have any similar problems or fears? Anyone else get the feeling they might be stuck with this for their entire life? I don't know how much more of this I can take.

lkh3si,Healthyhooha,1613406529.0,"I‚Äôm writing this post in hopes my story can help other women that may have not considered this as being a cause of their chronic vulvovaginitis (irritated, itchy, raw, burning vulva and vagina).

On Jan 1, my partner and I had intercourse and he did his business inside me, which we usually try to avoid since his semen can cause me to be itchy for a few hours. Jan 2, I woke up still itchy and now what was a burning sensation in my vagina, around my urethra, inner labia, and mild burning while urinating.

Long story short, I went to 3 doctors over the course of several weeks who only prescribed Diflucan and Terconazole cream for a yeast infection, but didn‚Äôt do any tests. It was an assumption on their part. Finally got in to my gyno who swabbed me, in which I came back positive for e. Coli and G. vaginalis. I was treated with Ampicillin for the e. Coli, and Tinidazole for BV. By end of Jan, all meds and treatments were totally done but I was STILL having a raw irritating feeling on the inner part of my vulva, and inside my vagina. My gyno told me the meds should have worked and she wasn‚Äôt sure what else could be causing it and basically blew me off. It hurt to touch, wear pants, walk, you name it. At this point I thought I was doomed and was going to be stuck like this forever. I started obsessively eliminating all things from my life including detergent, soaps, any scented items, toilet paper, all fruits, all sugar, all dairy. And still, I was in so much discomfort. Beginning of Feb, I was tested again and everything came back NEGATIVE. I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I thought that for sure I was going to have vulvodynia at this point since we‚Äôve ruled everything else out.

So, I saw a new gyno. After she examined me she said everything looked normal with the exception of some redness and dryness and suggested we treat this as a skin condition rather than a vaginal condition or infection. Did another swab and again, everything negative. She said that it‚Äôs possible that all of the meds I had been taking have caused my skin to go haywire. She recommended I go home and increase the humidity in my house, avoid long hot showers, drink at least 9 glasses of water each day, avoid salty foods and coffee/caffeine and wear underwear at all times rather than go without (as I have been doing thinking everything needed to air out). I also went and got a humidifier and CRANKED that thing up.

Low and behold, 24 hours later I felt almost 100% back to normal. It turns out all of the symptoms I was feeling were from DRY SKIN! 

I know this won‚Äôt be the case with everyone on here but I hope this is something that can give some ladies hope if they haven‚Äôt ruled this out yet. The symptoms felt IDENTICAL to that of a yeast infection or BV and was impossible to pinpoint since I did have an actual infection in the beginning, and kept thinking the meds surely just didn‚Äôt work.

So, ladies, if you are experiencing some irritation down there and your tests keep coming back negative, I encourage you to stop taking medications temporarily, add a probiotic, increase water intake and try to do anything to alleviate dry skin as possible. This is especially the case if you are already predisposed to severely dry skin on your whole body like I am. It‚Äôs quite likely if you‚Äôve been on so many abx or using creams to treat infections, it‚Äôs totally drying you out to the point where it‚Äôs causing you a whole separate problem. At least this was the case with me, and I would hate to have anyone else suffer the same way since ultimately I had to advocate for myself to come to this conclusion.


TLDR; If you are struggling to find the cause of irritation, burning, or itchiness of your vulva, and tests come back negative, try treating it as a dry skin issue instead of infection.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/lkh3si/chronic_vaginal_irritationitchiness_may_just_be/,Chronic vaginal irritation/itchiness may just be severely dry and irritated skin!,,219,56,1.0,Unusual-Telephone-87

1. They don't leak. My tampons leak ALL THE TIM. I've tried different sizes, putting them in differently, but inevitably some blood is going to end up in my underwear. That doesn't happen with pads.
2. I can tell when to change them. With tampons, I can usually guess pretty accurately, but it's not like I can look inside my vagina and see if it's time to replace my tampon. With pads, I can just look down.
3. They're softer. Sometimes, shoving cotton up my vagina and pulling it out when it's filled with blood feels a bit uncomfortable. No such problem with pads.
4. I can feel the blood coming out when I use pads. This is a bit weird, but sometimes I like being able to feel my period as it happens. Is that so wrong?

lgj91l,Healthyhooha,1612922206.0,"I must first acknowledge that I am so lucky to have a doctor who went the extra mile and did some research to help me. I had serious vaginal atrophy. Tearing with something as simple as a LUBRICATED SPECULUM being inserted. I had been bleeding, tearing, and in awful amounts of pain during sex since late august of 2020. I had seen 6-7 different doctors, all who misdiagnosed me. They chalked up the actual fissures to be result of a UTI, then a Yeast Infection, then BV, then BV again, then to just needing desitin. None of those things were my problem. I wasted money, physical pain, mental exhaustion, and precious time I could‚Äôve been using to bang my man for MONTHS. 

All because one doctor actually gave a shit. She thought maybe my hormonal birth control was causing these issues. Hormonal BC essentially puts your body itself into ‚Äúmenopause‚Äù because your body stops producing its normal amounts of hormones. This can cause vaginal dryness, sensitivity, atrophy of the tissues, and in rare cases (like mine) vaginal tearing. Birth control induced vulvodynia is REAL.

I got off the pill immediately, and I started to apply a specially prescribed cream with estrogen and testosterone to speed up the healing process. Two weeks in, I had to just try it out with my boyfriend. I wasn‚Äôt supposed to but we had basically not had enjoyable sex since the fall. 

Sure enough, I was WET (haven‚Äôt been able to get wet in years), absolutely ZERO pain, best experience ever.

I am so happy. Consider dropping your hormonal birth control and finding a different method if you‚Äôve been having chronic pain/tearing and dryness during sex!

d4dem0,Healthyhooha,1568506975.0,"Botched labiaplasties are common due to a lack of training standards and pervasive ignorance of anatomy. Most surgeons doing these procedures are, quite simply, doing surgeries they are not trained to do on anatomy they do not know well. 

Even experts like Miklos and Pelosi can be found misinforming patients about basic anatomy on RealSelf. This should be seen as a major red flag. 

In nearly every account I see of botched labiaplasties, I see women blaming themselves.
Self-blame has been present in nearly every story I get privately sent from other patients who have been hurt. And today I am seeing more self-blame on Reddit.

Example 1:
‚ÄúI almost feel like it‚Äôs the punishment I deserve for not being able to love my body in the first place. I feel like I don‚Äôt ever deserve to be happy again or enjoy sex.‚Äù

Example 2:
‚ÄúI‚Äôve spent thousands [‚Ä¶] to try to fix this problem that I pretty much created for myself.‚Äù

Women blame themselves for being vain, for choosing the wrong surgeon, etc. This is incredibly frustrating to me, knowing what I know about the field of female genital cosmetic surgery.

First of all, there are no training standards for labiaplasty, and neither OB/GYNs nor plastic surgeons are trained to do these procedures in residency.

Secondly, detailed surgical anatomy of the vulva, vulvar physiology, and vulvar biomechanics are generally missing from both OB/GYN and plastic surgery literature.

Compare getting a labiaplasty to getting a rhinoplasty (nose job). If you go to a board certified plastic surgeon for a nose job, you know your surgeon has been trained in rhinoplasty during their plastic surgery residency. You know they have performed this procedure under supervision during their training, and that they have received detailed instruction in techniques. You additionally can rest assured that they have detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the nose.

But with labiaplasty, you have none of these assurances. Getting a labiaplasty with your average board certified OB/GYN or plastic surgeon is like getting a rhinoplasty with a dermatologist. Is there a dermatologist out there who can perform rhinoplasty safely? I‚Äôm sure there is. But if you go to a dermatologist for a rhinoplasty, there are almost no safeguards in place to ensure your doctor is qualified.

Female genital cosmetic surgery has been controversial. For that reason, regulatory bodies, especially in OB/GYN, have not wanted to be involved in ensuring high standards of care. For example, while the American College of OB/GYNs approves these surgeries for medical reasons, they refuse to cooperate in the establishment of training standards.

Meanwhile, at surgery centers, privileging policies are typically in place to keep surgeons from performing surgeries they have not been trained to do. Going back to the rhinoplasty example, no surgery center would allow a dermatologist to perform a rhinoplasty. However, they will grant privileges to do labiaplasties to OB/GYNs and plastic surgeons who have never been trained to do labiaplasties.

What people need to understand is this all amounts to systemic negligence. As long as women keep blaming themselves instead of directing blame at those actually responsible, this will not change.

Currently, victims of this systemic negligence are invisible, as outcome studies are only published by experts with significant experience. While surgeons tell me they see many patients who have been severely harmed, these patients essentially do not exist in the female genital cosmetic surgery literature.

What laypeople need to understand is those who do publish FGCS outcome studies do so to promote their practices. Only surgeons with great outcomes and a large sample of patents have the incentive and ability to publish. There is meanwhile no incentive to publish bad outcomes unless there is money to made in repairs. As a result, the evidence basis for FGCS is not representative of the standard of care the average patient receives.

Personally, I suffered a dorsal nerve injury in a clitoral hood reduction performed without my consent during a labiaplasty. In my efforts to protect other patients from harm, I have done a dissection study with my plastic surgeon father, which we submitted to the Aesthetic Surgery Journal.

Though the potential for injury is clear, and though ignorance of the innervation of the clitoris is consistently demonstrated in OB/GYN and plastic surgery literature, the editors of the Aesthetic Surgery Journal question whether dorsal nerve injuries are a problem.

It is notable that when I consulted with one of the biggest FGCS experts in the country, he had no explanation for how I could have lost sensation. In order for me to know I suffered from a dorsal nerve injury, I had to do my own research, teach myself the anatomy, diagnose myself, and then find a doctor qualified to confirm it. How many patients diagnose themselves?

To those still blaming themselves, your botched labiaplasty was not your fault. And if you want to protect future patients, speak up. Healthy sexual function is a human right.

qe7w12,WomensHealth,1635005797.0,"I am making this post as a cautionary tale of my (30f) health experience in the hopes that this will encourage others to get vaccinated for HPV if they are not already so they can hopefully avoid what I am currently going through. I hope this is alright with the mod team, but if not I will understand if this post is removed.

When the HPV vaccine first came out I was right at or just above the cutoff age for it to be administered, which iirc was between 10-13. My parents at the time chose not to have me vaccinated for it because they were unsure of side effects from a brand new treatment. A few years ago the vaccine was approved for people into their 20s, and I had wanted to get it then but I was once again above the cutoff age. 

I mention this because of events playing out for me now: two months ago I went into a clinic after I moved for a job to get prescription refills. I didn't remember when my last pap smear had been done so when it was offered I agreed to a pelvic exam and all the rest. 

Well, that pap smear came back positive for HPV, as well as some abnormal cells that needed further investigation. Fearing cancer, I agreed to a colposcopy at the end of September. Samples were taken at four different places on and inside of my cervix where there was abnormal cell growth, and the doctor who administered that procedure informed me that the HPV vaccine was now available to women under age 45, and that while it was obviously too late to prevent the HPV I have now, it could prevent other types of HPV, So I agreed to start the vaccination rounds. I would get test results from my colposcopy a week later. 

That anxious week later I was told that, thankfully, I did not have cervical cancer. However, the abnormalities in my cervix were severe enough to be considered pre-cancerous and would need to be removed through a procedure called a LEEP, which is an acronym (iirc) for Looped Electrical Excision Procedure. A thin wire powered up with electricity is used to cut away the abnormal tissues and simultaneously cauterize the wounds. It can remove pre-cancer and could have been the end of this whole mess, but it's also partly diagnostic to check if further action must be taken.

I say *could have*, because unfortunately for me I learned that my cell abnormalities are high enough in my cervix that I now need to have a cone biopsy to remove the rest. A LEEP can be done in an OB/GYN clinic, but a cone biopsy is a surgical procedure that must be done at a hospital. I will be having this done 2-3 weeks from now. It will remove more tissue from my cervix, but I will heal from it and my cervix and uterus will remain in tact. 

Had I not gone in and had that pap smear two months ago, I might be telling a very different story today. I am *so glad* that I trusted my gut and went through all of this, and the doctors and nurses working with me have all been supportive and wonderful. In spite of all of this, I can't help but sigh and think about how this chain of events could have been *completely* avoided if I had gotten vaccinated for HPV as a pre-teen. 

So with all told, this is my call to action: if you are under 45 and have not gotten the HPV vaccine, please get the HPV vaccine. If you have sons and daughters, please get them vaccinated for HPV when you can. You will be saving them a lot of anxiety and heartache in the future. And regardless, please get your regularly scheduled pap smears, pelvic exams, etc. from your OB/GYN or other qualified care provider. This can literally save your life!

occasionally after sex, I would get cramps so bad they‚Äôd shoot down into both of my legs. figured it was deep penetration and nothing more.

woke up last week in the middle of the night in screaming pain. my obgyn is the best, agreed to see me first thing in the morning. She discovered I had a 12.5 cm ovarian cyst twisting on my right ovary and migrating to the left. i was taken in for emergency surgery by her colleague. 

it was the worst pain i‚Äôve ever felt in all my life. i screamed at the top of my lungs even though i was on the strongest pain medicine possible. I screamed the whole time until they put me under.

through c-section, they had to remove my right ovary and fallopian tube and of course, the cyst. They were able to drain and save the left ovary, so if i want to, i can still have kids with one ovary.

my point is, if you think something is wrong, do not hesitate to ask for an ultrasound. and do not listen to your general physicians if they are not listening to you. she was insisting i wasn‚Äôt having ovarian problems, just digestive and gallbladder issues. 

I‚Äôm just so thankful for my obgyn who caught the cyst in time, the surgeon who saved my life, and my boyfriend who i had by my side the entire time. he stayed in the hospital every night i was there and continued to help care for me at home. I am truly so grateful for him and his kindness.

zna8fn,WomensHealth,1671180966.0,"A hairball took me to the ER tonight. I've been breaking out in hives since Monday and have been smelling... questionable intermittently for a few months. This isn't because I'm cool with being stinky, but because no tests were coming back positive for anything unusual. My blood work, bv tests, std tests were all *totally* fine. So, frustrated asf, I continued smelling like a used bandaid and had no idea what to do about it. 

The obvious thing would have been to get a pelvic exam, but I only went to urgent care. Between appointments being booked out for months and a husband with cancer, I kept putting it off.

While ruminating, I started thinking about those horror stories where people lose tampons in their vag. That got me anxious enough to feel around, and the only thing out of place was what I previously assumed to be tangled IUD strings.

This led me to reading about rare cases of hair getting caught in the strings, which fit the texture perfectly. Gross. 

So today, after having constant hives, bad cramps, and smelling worse than ever, I went to the ER. I could tell the attending PA didn't believe my hair theory. After the examination, he called the oncall gynecologist for advice on proceeding, and I overheard him saying ""I've never seen this before either"". I feel so special. 

 I lost my 7 year old Paraguard, but hopefully with the help of antibiotics my body will stop being/smelling like an ass. Still waiting on the rest of the tests to come back, including a culture on the icky ""foreign object"".

She said that she didn‚Äôt find any yeast in some area and she found some in another but not much. She thought that my pain is not from a yeast infection but that my skin is overly sensitive after all the treatments I got for yeast (Even though I went to get treated for yeast because I was having pain). She did a swap and she also inserted some tools to look inside. Both of which were extremely painful. 

She then said she wants to do a deep disinfection of my vagina then give me a skin cream to put inside for a while. According to her, she had a patient with yeast infections for a year and she got rid of it with this deep disinfection. 

I had never heard of this before and it sounded weird. Then, I kid you not, she took a cotton ball, dunked it in disinfectant and then shoved it in my vagina, moved it around then left it there for a bit.

There are more tests that can be run for our vaginas that doctors don‚Äôt always offer. For example, there is a full spectrum yeast test that tests for more than just candida albicans. If you are having mystery problems down there, ask for this! Also ask for a BV test, mycoplasma and ureaplasma tests.

If your doctor denies, push the issue. Tell them to note in your chart that they denied you testing. You would be surprised how they can change their minds.

Learn how to use a speculum on yourself and at appointments, insert it yourself. If the doctor does not allow you to do this, time to get a new doctor.

Every time I go in for a gynecological appointment I insert my own speculum, and it is a powerful thing to do. 

I just had a full spectrum yeast test (am waiting for results) and had to ask for it specifically, even though my gyno knew I was in discomfort and all other tests were showing negative. My gyno also does not think genital mycoplasma/ureaplasma is a problem but she still did the test (negative thank god) because I demanded it.

Advocate for yourself and do not back down! I know it can be uncomfortable but so can 5 months of genital itching.

Was I wrong to leave class without permission and bleed on my science teachers seat?

I am a freshman in highschool. I was in science, with a male teacher. We were learning about punnet squares, and things like that.

I wasn't expecting my period to come for another two weeks, but I guess it's still irregular, especially since I just stated a few months ago, because all of the sudden, I got really bad cramps and felt a little weird.

I waited until the video we were watching was over and for him to pass out our assignment. I went up to his desk and asked him to go to the restroom. He said, no, and told me to finish the assignment. Luckily, I understood the assignment pretty well, so I finished it quickly. I went up to him again and asked him to go to the restroom. He said ""No. You didn't finish the assignment."" When I told him I did, he said to stop lying and sent me back to my seat.

I pretended to write on the paper for a little and went BACK up to him. At this point, my classmates were snickering. I showed him the paper and asked him to go to the restroom, and he said ""No. You lied about finishing the paper, so you're lying about needing to go to the bathroom. I told him they were ""female hygiene issues"" but he still said no. So I went back to the seat, and I bled through. I asked my friend for her sweatshirt, went up to the teacher, frustrated and didn't care about being polite at this point, and said ""I bled on your seat, I'm going to the bathroom, bye."" I took my backpack with me, because I always bring an extra pair of pants. My mom has told me way too many of her ""period in public"" stories.

When I was done, class was over and the next class had started. My science teacher caught me in the hallway and said ""You should've held your plop in. Now your blood is on my seat, and I am not cleaning it up."" He then proceeded to give me detention.

AITA for leaving class without permission and bleeding on his seat?

I'm scared to tell my mom, because I know she'll be mad that I didn't have courage to get up and leave the first time.

x7fn2j,WomensHealth,1662483426.0,"Warning: TMI 
I‚Äôm a very healthy, active 23-year old and don‚Äôt have any history of painful vaginal experiences. But over a week ago, I felt this extremely painful feeling on my bottom. I assumed it was due to my butt, considering I‚Äôve had problems with hemorrhoids in the last few years. 

Except it wasn‚Äôt my butt at all. I noticed it was so painful to sit down so I went to look in the mirror and sure enough, there was a small lump near the bottom of my left labia. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, assuming it would go away on its own. I even took ibuprofen which helped tremendously for 5 days. But once that wore off, the pain was a lot to endure. 

I still managed to go about my day performing regular activities, even going for runs. 

But one night, suddenly the pain became UNBEARABLE. I could not sleep all night. My bump has grown SO big, spreading through my entire labia and even covering my hole. Based on my research, I saw that it was something called Bartholin Cyst but still wasn‚Äôt 100% sure. At that point, 4 ibuprofens were not doing me justice. That morning, I got out of bed barely able to walk, sit or just move in general. 

My husband took me to this emergency after-hours clinic. We waited for 3 hours while I was on the verge of passing out from the pain. Finally, the doctor came in and touched around the area. She told me, ‚ÄúI am so sorry but I am not comfortable performing an incision on you. It is‚Ä¶very extensive and deep. I don‚Äôt want to do something that will make it worse. So, I‚Äôm going to refer you to the hospital next door.‚Äù 

One hour later, I‚Äôm at the hospital, crying in so much pain. The doctor touched the area, said I had an infection (called an abscess) and performed an ultrasound to see if it needed to be drained or if I could get away with just antibiotics.  

One look at that ultrasound and she said, ‚ÄúOh yeah. This needs to be drained right away. We‚Äôre going to need do an incision.‚Äù 

At this point, I didn‚Äôt care what they had to do. I just wanted the pain to be over. 

The doctor first had to numb my vagina. That. Part. Was. The. Most. Painful. Experience. In. My. Entire. Life. The doctor even sent the nurse to get more numbing injections because of how big it was. I was crying so hard, squeezing the life out of my husband‚Äôs hand. 

Then it went numb. They performed the incision. I didn‚Äôt feel anything but this SIGNIFICANT amount of pressure. My husband‚Äôs eyes went wide and I just saw puddles of puss come out. 

They put me on antibiotics and told me to do sitz baths (which helps tremendously). I‚Äôve been wearing pads too to help with the drainage. 

I feel significantly better now, despite the amount of blood I lost. But it needed to be done. I pray it never happens again.

ldus6r,WomensHealth,1612606059.0,"UPDATE BELOW!

I‚Äôve been on the combination pill for almost a decade now, and decided this month that I‚Äôve had enough of it. I started the pill almost as soon as I started my period to help with cramping and acne. I switched to the Mirena IUD at one point a couple years ago just to try it out and got the worst acne of my life. Being back on the pill helped get things back to normal skin wise, but then I plateaued and have been dealing with a decent bit of acne that won‚Äôt go away, but it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

My biggest reason for getting off the pill is suffering from low libido and insane dryness to a point where I knew my marriage was suffering. I started getting anxious about sex and even masturbation because it would sting and occasionally bleed because I was so dry. No lube was enough to make my vagina just feel ready for sex and it was awful. I never wanted sex physically, but always mentally and it was taking a huge toll on my marriage and my confidence.

It‚Äôs only been about three weeks since getting off and I haven‚Äôt gotten my first ‚Äúoff the pill‚Äù period yet but I don‚Äôt even care how miserable it might be. Nearly the next day after getting off the pill, I was full blown WAP. I craved sex more then I ever had, everything my husband does turns me on, I‚Äôm actually wet again from just thinking about sex, and I stay wet all through sex. There‚Äôs zero pain, zero tearing, zero anxiety. I feel more confident in myself, I have more energy, I just feel happier and lighter.

I obviously haven‚Äôt been off long enough to really see how this plays out, especially with my skin and my period, but to me it‚Äôs all worth it. I feel like myself for the first time in so long. I‚Äôll update as the rest of the month plays out, and I‚Äôm fully expecting lots of changes, but if I can keep even a tiny bit of this bliss, it‚Äôs so worth it.


UPDATE:

So I‚Äôm officially almost two months off the pill. Still very happy with my choice to get off. My first period was almost exactly how it was on the pill, which was interesting to me because I got on originally for awful cramps and acne. But my flow was maybe a tiny bit heavier, and the cramps on day one were definitely worse, but not at all debilitating.

However! I got a yeast infection once my period finished up which I‚Äôve never experienced before. It cleared up just fine with some Monistat, but that definitely sucked and was different. I read that your first period of BC can just be a withdrawal period and not be very intense, so next period may be different. But as of now, my period came a few days earlier than I expected, lasted around 5 days, that 5th day being just the light pink/brown discharge, then it was gone )and the YI came lol).

As for sex, I don‚Äôt like period sex and the YI threw me off a bit lol. But to be completely honest, my sex drive has kind of tanked a little again. I‚Äôm just not craving it as much as I had right when I got off which definitely sucks. But I chalk that up to being nervous and stressed for leaving for the military soon.

No matter how I tried to get rid of it shaving, hard wax, sugar wax, hair removal cream, I got terrible ingrowns and it looked so bad. 
WELL last Friday I had to get surgery for a cyst on my ovary and the night before I had to wash myself with dial bar soap because it‚Äôs antibacterial. Earlier that day before the shower I had actually shaved my bikini line because I went to the pool and even bled a little on one side and was already dreading the ingrowns and how itchy the regrowth wasn‚Äôt going to be. Well it‚Äôs been a week and I‚Äôve been washing my body every day with that soap due to me just wanting to take care of my incisions and my bikini line hair grew back NORMAL!! No ingrown hairs, no ugly red bumpy angry skin, and some how LESS HAIR???? On top of this miracle my bacne has completely gone away, I also shaved my ass for the pool and it is BABY SMOOTH!!! I‚Äôm literally never going to wash myself with anything else. I will also add that I just used a regular loofa to scrub my body and no other thing to exfoliate my skin.

14j5nq5,Healthyhooha,1687749362.0,"Since I was little, probably starting in middle school I've had a problem with odor down there. I will admit when I was younger I didn't have the best hygiene, but even as an adult and practicing good hygiene I still have this issue. I've been told my so many people throughout my life how horrible I smell. The comments are typically made after I use the restroom and everyone describes it as a strong onion smell mixed with vagina. It is so strong it will stink up the whole bathroom. I've been publicly embarassed, verbally abused and have lost friends over it. People literally hate me because of it. I've been told to kill myself so many times because it is a better than having this reputation. The smell is really bad when I have hair so I've learned to shave regularly. Even still, the smell can happen. If I've been sweating, even with very mild exercise like a relaxing walk, the smell can come back. I have used washes, Lume deodorant, powders, probiotics, boric acid suppositories and they do help most of the time but there are still times when I can notice it. I do my best to control it. But I feel that I have so much trauma and emotional damage created by it. I've been treated so terribly for something that is not really my fault. I don't have STDs or other infections but people think im dirty or a slut because of the odor. Oddly enough, I haven't had many men tell me about the odor during sex. I've asked and most have told me I don't have a smell. The smell happens when I go to the bathroom so it's very confusing. I think I may have bromhidrosis and sweat a lot on my inner thighs and labia. I'm so embarassed by this and feel ashamed I don't even want to do certain activities and can't trust people because many of my ""friends"" have made me into a joke.

tk3spf,Healthyhooha,1647958001.0,"Hello all!

I've been having this issue for years at this point - I've had 20+ confirmed UTIs, 2 kidney infections that sent me to the ER, and am now maybe on my 5th round of BV.

I was referred to a urologist for the chronic, recurrent UTIs once a few years ago, but they refused to prescribe me antibiotics despite testing positive for a UTI and I had to seek care elsewhere because without them, I could FEEL the UTI turning into another kidney infection. After that, I didn't trust them to treat me and didn't go back, and then moved and wasn't having sex for a long time so it sort of fell off my radar. My primary and I have, we think, traced the UTIs back to condom usage, so easy solution there right? I have a hormonal IUD, just stop using condoms! The problem then arises that when I don't use condoms, I get BV instead, and I'm losing my mind.

Before anyone asks, I wipe front to back, my partners are clean and hygienic (as am I), this has happened with both circumcised and uncircumcised partners, I ALWAYS pee immediately after sex, this has happened with IUDs, the pill, no birth control, etc., no scented soaps around my genitals and never soap inside the vaginal canal, I do everything right and this issue still persists.

An additional complicating factor here is my laundry list of antibiotic allergies - amoxicillin, penicillin, sulfa, ALL cephalosporins. Not great, and I really cannot be taking the few antibiotics I'm able to use as often as I've needed to because of this issue, resistance is a big and growing concern here. So it feels at this point like my options are:

1. Use condoms, almost definitely contract a UTI (that could turn into a kidney infection AGAIN) and have to take antibiotics, which will likely lead to BV themselves (which would require even more antibiotics) anyway
2. Don't use condoms and eliminate the risk of a UTI but instead risk of an STD and/or BV, both of which would also require me to use antibiotics (and that's if I get lucky and it's only gonorrhea or chlamydia or one that's treatable with antibiotics, consequences w this option obviously could be much more severe)
3. Get thee to a nunnery

I am really at a loss here, this issue is embarrassing and painful and at this point, scary. I've taken macrobid and azithromycin more times than I can count, and if I get a more serious infection and those stop working, I'm potentially really, truly fucked. If anyone has faced this same dilemma, and found a way to solve it, I'd be so grateful for your help!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/tk3spf/using_condoms_gives_me_utis_not_using_them_gives/,"Using condoms gives me UTIs, not using them gives me BV, I'm gonna join a convent",Advice Needed ,201,67,1.0,modernvintage

xm3typ,Healthyhooha,1663954244.0,"long post! TL;DR at the end.

possible tmi for this first part: i was having sex with my boyfriend and when i went to suck him off after he was just inside me i noticed that his dick tasted super sour. i knew the vagina was acidic but this flavour was like, battery acid strong? stronger than vinegar i would say. this wasn‚Äôt a one time occurrence; it was every time we had sex. 

i got concerned. i googled it. after doing some extensive research in multiple forums with entirely different perspectives and advices, i decided to try the methods that made the most sense: quitting caffeine and cigarettes.

and what do you know? two weeks later, i am having sex with my bf and taste his dick afterwards, and it tastes mildly sweet and only a tiny, almost unnoticeable bit sour, which actually created a very pleasant combo. i am in awe! 

just wanted to share for those having similar concerns. and, please do not use scented soaps, vinegar, or baking soda baths on your vulva or vagina (yes i have seen the last two being recommended followed by descriptions of how painful it was)

note: caffeine dehydrates you, making all your bodily fluids more concentrated and less diluted by water. by quitting caffeine and drinking more water, i might‚Äôve just ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù the flavour. and smoking generally affects the taste of the vagina, this has been proven. :)

I was actually hoping that would be it so I could just treat it and move on. But alas, it couldn‚Äôt be that easy.

*EDIT:* Okay, WOW! I can‚Äôt believe my tear filled rant has gotten THIS many comments and suggestions and support. Thank you to every single one of you for every tip, I was feeling so defeated this morning and now I feel like I have a whole new list of things to try and look into! Also FUCK the fact that there are 40 comments on this and almost all of them have been a woman saying they went through the same thing/ something similar. Truly can‚Äôt believe a Reddit post has been more informative and helpful to me than every doctor I visited combined. 

The very fact that there is a ""rant"" flair in a sub about women's health is just \*chef's kiss\* for my story.

This is going to be long-winded so I apologize now, but if you feel like getting angry about the health system failing yet another woman read on. 

TLDR: I have been struggling with a consistant BV/yeast/UTI for the past year and a half and every doctor I have gone to has told me the they don't know what's wrong with me and sent me home and it's sucks a lot. 

I am a 24-year-old female who has been struggling with vaginal health my whole life but more drastically this past year. I have been getting yeast infections regularly since I was an infant. My mom had to take me to the doctor at less than a year old and I was never allowed to have any soaps or bubbles in my baths because I am just \~prone\~ to yeast infections. That has stayed true my whole life but it turns out it's not just yeast infections, it's everything about my microbiome. I have gotten some combination of UTIs, BV, and yeast infections at least twice a year my whole life. Because of this, I know ALL the ""rules."" Nothing but breathable underwear, only wash with water, pee after sex, take probiotics, don't wear pants/underwear to bed, blah blah blah. I have heard it all and my WHOLE life revolves around maintaining these things. I will inconvenience myself to no end to make sure that I do not go a whole day without taking a probiotic because it means at least a week of misery.

Last year, I had what felt like a weird combo of a yeast infection and a UTI. It burned, but like all the time and internally and externally. I did the usual Monistat treatment and it didn't help. So I did what you're supposed to do and went to the doctor. She tested me for pregnancy, STI's, BV, UTI, and yeast. All came up negative. She sent me away with a pamphlet that told me to wipe front to back and not to douche. Sick. 

Fast forward to 6 months, 4 gynos, and 1 urologist later: I'm still in miserable pain, I can not leave my house without a full box of AZO because that seems to be the only thing that helps, and I have to pee every 3 seconds. Every single doctor tested me for those same things listed above. Every single test came up negative. By the end of the 6 months, I had been on 10 (no I am not exaggerating) different antibiotics which absolutely RUINED my gut health and my microbiome even more. I was bleeding for months at a time and every single doctor simply shrugged their shoulders and wrote me a new prescription for an antibiotic that they weren't sure was going to work. In the meantime, I was also trying to self-treat at home. I did everything I could find in the depths of reddit. Garlic, Hydrogen peroxide, apple cider vinegar, D-mannos, boric acid, changing my birth control brand/type, you name it. Finally I went to the last gyno and broke down sobbing in her office because I couldn't have sex with my boyfriend of two years and felt like I was broken and not one of these doctors could tell me what was wrong or made any effort to try. She decided to put me on metrogel for two weeks which is a super long time for that drug but it seemed to work, although I am not sure if it was that or the things I was doing at home. I really don't know what it was that finally resolved it. 

Everything seemed to be clear for about the next 9 months and I was feeling better. About 2 months ago, though, it came back. I have moved since this first happened so I had to find a new gyno and surprise surprise I go in, they give me the same test for the same things, it comes up negative. They tell me to come back because they want to do another test. Turns out it's the same exact test that, strap in, also came up negative again. So now I have spent $600 in the past two weeks for doctors to look me in the face and tell me they have no idea what is wrong with me or how to help me. It's now 2 days from christmas and I am supposed to go on vacation next week and I am scared to go because I can't even run to the store without wanting to burst into tears with pain. 

I have SCOURED every corner of the internet on this subject and I know that I am not the only one with a similar story. All of this is so say that I honestly can not believe that so many women suffer from similar situations like this and it is completely acceptable for doctors to just shrug their shoulders, charge you, and send you home. If you've gone through this, please let me know because it feels better to not be alone. And if you know some sort of saccrificial ritual I can do to help, please share...

Turns out she had a type of yeast that is only 1% of the yeast of infections and so rare so labs don't test for them. So when they say no yeast infection, you still can have yeast infection. Also it turns out you can have yeast resistance analysis which is also useful, works just like antibiotics resistance.

Her infection was saccharomyces cerevisiae, common baker yeast, and was resistant to Fluconazole, thus not responding to previous antifungal medication.

nzbeo6,WomensHealth,1623634420.0,"19F. Yesterday I was having a conversation with my mom, and somehow it progressed to talking about sexual stuff. I was diagnosed with vaginismus (no physical abnormalities but tightening of the vaginal muscles and bad pain with penetration) about 5 months ago. I told my mom right after the diagnosis but she brushed it off as me just being nervous. Yesterday I opened up to her in frustration and emotion about how hard it was, and that it was more than just normal pain. She told me to just push through the pain and get stuff all the way in. 

Along with this, I told her some sexual stuff with her encouragement for me to keep talking. I told her how I was worried to get in a relationship because I can‚Äôt have sex, and she told me that that was a major problem because no guy would want to be in a serious relationship without sex. I also told her about how I thought oral sex was gross (didn‚Äôt go into details or said I did it, which I have) and also about how one time when I was with a guy, he wanted me to do anal sex with him (but me penetrate him with a strap on) and how I found that gross and didn‚Äôt want to do that and was worried that guys wouldn‚Äôt want to be with me if I didn‚Äôt.

I also told her how I was trying to use dilators for my vaginismus to practice but hadn‚Äôt made much progress, and that I met up with my ex boyfriend a couple of weeks ago secretly and insinuated we did sexually stuff, and that that also hurt very badly.

I never told her not to tell anyone, but I figured that she wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äî especially not to my dad (I have overheard her telling him and other people things that I‚Äôve told her not to talk about before, but I feel like this is worse).

Flash forward to late last night, around 11pm. I‚Äôm eating cereal, and then hear my name from upstairs, so sneak into a corner to listen, while petting my cats to prevent them from making noise. It was about a half an hour conversation, of my mom telling my dad everything that I told her. She told him that I didn‚Äôt like giving blowjobs, and about the anal sex thing with that guy, about how she was going to have nightmares about all this stuff, etc. My dad was like ‚Äúreally?

I overheard them talking to each other about if I was ok, but was bugged me was what my dad said: ‚Äúgod only knows what she‚Äôs doing in there.‚Äù

I feel really embarrassed, angry, and only tiny tiny portion of myself finds this all amusing, but that is being replaced my the prior emotions as time passes.

kfn1fq,Healthyhooha,1608304901.0,Well today is sh*tty. I‚Äôve been having symptoms of itchiness and and burning. I already have pelvic pain syndrome and everything looked normal. I got tested for all the STD‚Äôs to make sure plus it was time for me to do it again anyways. I learned that I have Herpes simplex virus 2. I never had an outbreak so that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt know I had it. I just got the call from my doctor and that everything else was negative. I‚Äôm so upset right now. Because obviously herpes has no cure. And I feel like my sex life is over. I have some questions and need some advice from anyone who has it? Does herpes weaken my immune system? Can the outbreaks only be on my labia (in that area I know u can have it on ur face lips). My doctor is going to prescribe me a daily medicine to help prevent and treat symptoms. Meaning now al my doctors gotta know I have herpes. Can I spread herpes if I for example had unprotected sex but didn‚Äôt have an outbreak? Does anyone have any tips for how to get rid of outbreaks when they do happen? Can I still receive oral? Even tho there‚Äôs no cure can I ever test and it not be detectable in the blood anymore? Can this affect my scent down there? How often do outbreaks usually occur with daily medication? I‚Äôm so upset right now. I feel ugly and have no reason to live again.

ssk9lb,WomensHealth,1644869993.0,"I hope the title isn't too crude but I think it needs to be said bluntly. Things like oral contraceptives and other BC are a miracle for women. Having the OPTION to take it to protect yourself from unwanted pregnancy is YOUR right ( not an obligation). We are lucky.
Our grandmothers often could not say no to their partners. 

A lot has changed but much hasn't. 
I see now that men have weaponized women's contraceptive and made women and girls feel that:

A. It's your responsibility to get on the BC regardless of if you want to.

B. That if you are on contraceptive he can cum in you as much as he wants with zero accountability

C. That it's evil for you to even suggest he get a vasectomy if he never wants kids or try some other method like rhythm method 

D. That once you are on BC you have to take it til menopause or until he's done dating you. Even if it makes you sick.

E. That men shouldn't have to take BC with the same side effects of a women's contraceptive


So let's address these.

A1. I can't believe I have to say this but you don't have to take the pill just because it's normalized and accessible. It's actually a bit disturbing how much the side effects are downplayed. 

A2. I have my own horror story where i bled for months on end and doctors didn't care and told me it's fine and NORMAL and very common on that pill. Lost a lot of money because I couldn't work during some of this time. 
They actually hid this side effect from me even though I specifically asked about the most common side effects when I was asking them questions. You do not have to take it just because it's there and ""safe""

B1. The man is responsible for his sperm. You are not his receptacle. I'm a bit sick of men refusing to accept it's their fault they came in a woman repeatedly because she forgot or lied about BC. Yes so wrong to lie about taking your pill but also wrong for them to act as if BC is foolproof. No contraceptive is a 100%. They have to do THEIR PART.

B2. Furthermore semen is not good for your vagina's pH. This is an incredibly important point. 
I have heard multiple stories from women who didn't understand why they had constant vaginal infections. Only after ending their relationship did they realize that it was all because of him. No doctor ever told me this I had to learn it from other women's forums. Semen is naturally more alkaline and vaginas are supposed to be acidic. If he is cumming in you on a regular basis he is putting you at a high risk of infections and probably doesn't care. You're really going to destroy your health just so he can have a slightly better orgasm?

C1. If it's fair for him to want you to do it it's fair for you to expect him to do it. The amount of men who don't want kids or more kids ever but refuse vasectomy without even a moment's thought is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. At the very least the idea should be on the table for discussion.. Just like birth control is suggested to me from a young age boys should be routinely educated about their options and why it's their responsibility.  Not just condoms. For some reason if you merely suggest the idea they act as if you are trying to force it on them. It's pure projection.

C2. Also to elaborate on the rythm method which is as effective as the pill if both partners are doing their part. Most versions of the Rhythm method only mention tracking your cycle then using condoms near ovulation but the other step is the man actually doing the withdrawal method even when you are not ovulating. Used in conjunction this is an effective, SAFE, and fair option. No woman ever had a stroke from tracking her cycle. If you want to take extra precautions you can get ovulation tests

D1. This is self explanatory. I think most women know this but I've still seen men try to bully their girlfriends and wives into staying on birth control that is making them feel awful just because it will be a slight inconvenience for him if she stops.
I heard a story the other day about a woman who wanted to switch birth control and her boyfriend immediately told her that she can't because then she will start getting her periods again. Thankfully she broke up with him. Who is raising these boys?

E1. So they tested birth control pills on men. Men refuse to take them because then they would have to suffer the way women are expected to suffer. Also men are not the ones who have to carry the pregnancy so I think they would not be very trustworthy with it. Women are put through this without even being given proper warning. They give you a little pamphlet that they know most people are not even going to bother reading. 
Also the pamphlet downplays everything and flat out doesn't mention lots of side effects. You're basically expected to read 16 pages of fine print and comprehend all that the minute you become sexually active which for many women is when they are children. 

I'm glad I was able to access birth control when I was young but it's very sketchy situation and I would be pretty upset if my child was being given drugs without my knowledge. I understand they do this because otherwise teen pregnancy would be out of control. Still messed up

Final message. I'm not trying to demonize birth control pills or anything like that. Like I said in the beginning they are awesome but they are risky. I also know a lot of women do not really suffer the side effects. My friend has endometriosis and the pill was the only thing that made her life bearable. So go ahead and test it out but don't let society make you think you have to.

exa7i7,Healthyhooha,1580581020.0,"I will try to make this as short as possible but unfortunately my story, like many others I see here, is long. i have been dealing with this for almost 5 years. 24 y/o female.

fall/winter 2015: developed what I thought was a uti after sex and was treated for a uti without being tested for it, based on my described symptoms. went back to the doctor saying that i still had a slight discomfort urinating, but the uti test was negative to i was sent on my way. was informed by a guy i had slept with he had chlamydia. went to ob/gyn and told her i was told this. she prescribed me the typical one dose of azithromycin. i did not feel relief from the discomfort while peeing. i went back to the ob/gyn convinced i was not cured of the chlamydia. lab results indicated i was negative for chlamydia. doctor told me i was having anxiety ""from the thought of having an std"" 

2016-2019: symptoms progressively got worse. experienced constant discomfort urinating that sometimes was outright pain, discharge that ranged from clear to bright yellow/green and always mucus-y and always a LOT of it, pelvic pain, lower back pain, itchiness that would be so severe it would wake me up in the middle of the night, throbbing pains inside the vagina randomly, an extremely sensitive clitoris, and a constant feeling of burning sensation inside and outside of the vagina. eventually i even felt symptoms in my anal region. I also would randomly get fevers and chills. I went to 7 different ob/gyns, a dermatologist, an allergist, a urologist, and a urogynocologist. all my tests for everything always came back negatives. despite having high white blood cell counts, doctors basically all told me i was making it up or just had really bad anxiety and was overthinking things. i insisted that my pain was severe and very real. doctors tried to treat me for bv, yeast infections, and even prescribed 2 weeks of doxycycline just for good measures. i felt minimal if no relief. the only thing that seemed to help was coating the area in olive oil. towards the later years i also felt tired all the time, as well as flat out depressed and anxious. I could not understand how no one could figure out what was wrong with me. i graduated college and felt i could not hold a job because of how much pain i was in. i could barely stand to have sex, and if i did would bleed after usually. my periods became irregular. I became obsessed with researching possibilities online. 

2020: Finally, I discovered the mycoplasma forum on reddit. I demanded my original ob/gyn do a PCR test for mycoplasma. he had never heard of it. i insisted. I went a couple days later to an infectious disease specialist to have her perform the same test, plus antibiotic resistance tests (i was scared of getting a false negative and figured two tests wouldnt hurt). **I have been confirmed positive just this week (Jan 2020) for BOTH mycoplasma genitalium and ureaplasma, as well pneumonia of the urinary tract.** I am waiting to hear back about the antibiotic resistance as it takes longer. being as i had previously been on 2 weeks of doxy without relief, I asked for 14 days of moxifloxacin. initially i had felt a little better and became hopeful, but today (day 9) i have felt my symptoms return strongly. i am so upset that no one suggested these tests and that i had to demand them. i'm so angry at the multitude of doctors that suggested i was ""crazy"" all these years. i was hoping someone would have some advice for me. i am terrified reading online about how these infections are very hard to cure. i cannot live with this pain my whole life- it is unbearable. i wouldnt wish this physical, mental, and emotional stress on my worst enemy. i completely have forgotten what it feels like to pee without pain. 

Crazy how doctors always tell you not to worry yourself and read stuff online- when that is the ONLY thing that that helped me get answers. i knew i wasn't losing my mind! to anyone who is out there suffering and not getting answers- ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF. You know your body best and you know when something is not right!

1) what do i do if i finish 14 days of moxi and still feel symptoms? i didnt respond to 2 weeks of doxy, should i try 3 weeks? 

2) due to my lower back pain and pelvic pain, i am terrified i have permanent scarring on my kidneys and/or ovaries. what tests can i ask for to determine if this is the case? is infertility from this permanent?

3) i have never even heard of pneumonia in the urinary tract. do you think this is unrelated, and that the ureaplasma just has left me susceptible to other infections?

4) I have had this for quite a long time- how can i be sure it is gone? obviously i am not going to have sex until i produce a negative result to prevent reinfecting.

pq2yc0,Healthyhooha,1631894466.0,"After getting married in March of 2020, I began getting what I thought were constant postcoital UTIs . I was prescribed antibiotic after antibiotic for them. Things never seemed to improve however in March of 2021 , things hit In March of 2021, I got a burning pain that felt like a constant UTI that just simply wouldn‚Äôt stopped. For months, I went to gyn after gyn believing I had a UTI that wouldn‚Äôt go away - however each time my tests came back normal. The OBGYNs treated me then for BV, yeast - everything under the sun. When I didn‚Äôt respond to treat , they make a slurry of claims. They said that my pain was purely psychogenic and to top it all off, they blamed my husband for abuse (by far not the case - I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better partner to spend my life with. The only reason why I believe they got this idea was because I am visibly Muslim and wear hijab). 

Fast forward to July of 2021, I was able to see a vulvar specialist at Northwestern Hospital. There she took me seriously and diagnosed me with pudendal neuralgia, psorsiatic-like dermatitis, and hypertonic pelvic floor. Thanks to her , I have gotten the treatment I so desperately needed months prior and am living almost 90% pain free .

pe1njx,Healthyhooha,1630264513.0,"If you keep testing positive for BV, yeast, or UTIs despite completing treatment and are clear for all other STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, trich), please ask to be tested for **ureaplasma/mycoplasma via PCR cervix swab** if you haven't already. This goes for any person who is sexually active. Including giving/receiving unprotected oral.¬†This test is not included on basic STD panels, which is why many people haven't even heard of it before. 

It's important to note that cultures and urinalyses won't typically grow this bacteria. If you received a negative result for ureaplasma/mycoplasma at some point via culture, but still experience weird/unique symptoms, it would be in your best interest to be swabbed for it using a **PCR test** instead. Urine PCR is even less sensitive/effective, so *swab is best.*

Your doctors may refuse to test you for this bacteria because they believe it is naturally-occuring- this is a *myth* and it is *wrong*. Ureaplasma/mycoplasma is in fact an STI and it can lead to pelvic floor dysfunction, infertility, and miscarriages. It is also TREATABLE with **PROPER** antibiotics. Azithromycin, the same medicine used to treat chlamydia, will not be effective on its own in this case. **Doxycycline** has proven to eradicate the infection; a 7-10 day course 2x daily is all that's needed. You MUST treat your sexual partner, as well. Your symptoms of recurring BV, yeast, and UTIs *will* dissipate/resolve after treatment if you find that you are positive.

Personally, I dealt with constant infections back to back for 3 years straight before someone ON THE INTERNET suggested that I be tested for this. My doctor even mentioned that my cervix looked perfectly healthy and nothing appeared wrong. My symptoms ranged from burning after urinating to excess watery vaginal discharge with an odor. Others who have encountered this infection have reported various other symptoms which don't immediately appear to be caused by infection. 

Do not let a doctor dismiss you on your symptoms. If something feels wrong, listen to your body. You know your body the best. Some people have no symptoms at all but would never know they had this infection if they didn't ask to be tested specifically.

To say it was a living nightmare would be an understatement. I was in so much pain and discomfort, none of the doctors would take me seriously and would just prescribe a bunch of medicine and send me off, I was suicidal, I felt like I could never have a normal sex life (couldn‚Äôt dream of having sex more than once in a week). I tried everything under the sun, but to no avail, I tried the candida diet, probiotics, only wearing cotton underwear, etc but nothing seemed to work, the infections would still return. I thought this hell would never end until I saw a gynecologist specialized in vaginal infections. He told me my issues were recurring because I had probably messed up my vaginal flora with all the antibiotics/antimycotics I was taking for the infections, so the key was giving my vagina a clean slate. He tested me and I was only positive for BV this time, so I did the usual 7 day metronidazole treatment but this time, and this is key, he instructed me to take boric acid suppositories for 27 days after the metronidazole to kill off resistant organisms, and to do a week of vaginal probiotic suppositories after that so the lactobacillus could reconolize. Also, he advised to take oral probiotics throughout the entire course of the treatment.

So, I went in for my 5th gynecologist visit. I‚Äôve seen so many different doctors for this (hard to get an appointment with my preferred doc) and this doctor completely minimized my pain and suffering. I‚Äôm so done dealing with this and feeling invalidated. It ruined my sex life, I was in pain, and emotionally I just felt so down on myself. 

So I finally decided to get surgery. I was fully put to sleep, and the surgeon cut me open and decided which surgery to perform on the spot. My options were marsupialization and gland excision (much more invasive, but guarantees it won‚Äôt come back). 

I woke up a few hours later and she told me she excised the gland. That was yesterday. Yesterday, I was in quite a bit of pain but manageable. They sent me home with 4 doses of 5mg oxycontin and ibuprofen. That helped a lot with the pain yesterday. This morning I woke up, the pain meds wore off, and honestly the pain is not bad. 

I lean forward to pee so it doesn‚Äôt get on the wound, then I pour water on it just in case (doc recommended a peri bottle but I don‚Äôt want to go out and get one). Walking is a bit uncomfortable, I definitely wouldn‚Äôt walk more than 100 yards or so. I‚Äôve been wearing pads the past 24 hours, blood is still coming out slowly. Vulva is a little swollen.

It's happened so much to the point that I have the whole thing planned generally planned out. (I really am sorry for talking about this..) It's been like this for the past couple of years..

If it's not that, it's usually a series of bad panic attacks that often last for 6hrs. At times I don't sleep or eat. (Which was the case just hours ago too.. I had to be force fed to break my fast).

I can't afford counseling and therapy, but I only realize this pattern once my period hits. The worst feelings and behaviors manifest up until the moment I get my period.. then it gradually simmers down from there 

I'll be honest.. I am still feeling the same feelings I had just hours ago. But I do want to figure this out, even if it may just be the scientific/technical aspect of it. Am I the only one crying and rocking myself, drowning in my thoughts until my period arrives? Does anyone else experience this?

im1cl1,Healthyhooha,1599164451.0,"Inspired by a recent TikTok I watched where commenters insisted that thongs were more comfortable. I wore thongs in HS and college before deciding they were way more trouble than they were worth. I just find that fabric in my buttcrack and directly pressing on my butthole all day to be really irritating! I'd wear one for a special occasion but I just can't see how it's comfortable. Do I have an oversensitive butt? I can feel it sliding up and down all day, ""butt floss"" is an accurate term, and that shit is just so uncomfortable! How is that better than regular underwear?

Some people said regular underwear gives them wedgies and yes, a thong is prob more comfortable than that. But I feel like that could be avoided by just buying the right size underwear, I only get wedgies from old worn out pairs and when that happens, it's a sign I need to throw them out.


If you find thongs more comfortable, explain yourself. I just do not get it and yes, I have worn them, various styles, various sizes. Is the comfort of freed buttcheeks worth the fabric jammed in the crack all day? Does it depend on your butt size/shape? Some people said they didn't even feel it...am I the only one who has nerve endings back there?

Thongs are uncomfortable, change my view.

A whole bunch of edits below:

OK I HAVE A FOLLOW UP QUESTION NOW - for those of you that wear thongs, back when it was a thing, did you also wear/look good in low-rise jeans? I always got plumber's crack no matter what. So I am wondering if it's just my weird buttcrack lol

also how do i get the thong to rest gently on top of my buttcrack instead of all up in my cheeks?

also its funny how half of you find thongs more comfortable because you have a big butt, and the other half of you finds thongs uncomfortable because you have a big butt.


I can def see how regular underwear is uncomfortable for some people but i would probably just not wear underwear in that case

MORE EDITS:

wow, this has been really interesting! I'm starting to realize that I'm probably kind of fussy about comfort. I hate shapewear, strapless bras, heels, tight clothes...I usually don't even need a thong since I don't wear tight enough clothes for VPL.
But as there are women on this planet who insist that heels are comfortable, so there are women who insist that thongs are.

One more edit: 

U/thayaht solved the case in this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/im1cl1/do_you_find_thongs_comfortable/g3xsc26/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Never would have thought there‚Äôd be such varied anatomy!

Now y‚Äôall have me looking at butts in nsfw subs looking for all the variations that could affect this lol. And there‚Äôs so many! Tight butts, loose butts, deep buttcracks, shallow buttcracks, buttcrack length...all of these could affect comfort way more than if you just have a big/small butt.

And everyone, please do not take this personally, it‚Äôs a shitpost about underwear. I assumed people who say things are comfortable are like people who say heels are comfortable. See what I mean? Didn‚Äôt realize there‚Äôs like a thousand kinds of buttcheeks.

At 21 on my first visit to the GYN they found a mass in my breast. After imaging and biopsies it turns out to be a fibroadenoma. In three years I've had 3 breast masses, three biopsies, one lumpectomy and imaging every 6 months. Now, at 24, my GYN took a closer look at my hymen when I started crying from pain during my pap. As it turns out I have a sepatated hymen (i'm a virgin) and that's why I can't wear tampons. She says I should have a hymenectomy to avoid lots of pain and bleeding during sex.

wafdfa,Healthyhooha,1659028138.0,"Recently I got a new job that involves transporting/storing high value objects and artifacts. Some days, this is local work at museums and collectors homes. Other times, its long trips. Monday was my first long trip- it was also the first day of my period. So at this new job, on my first trip, I was fighting bad cramps, driving a big truck, other new aspects of the job, and limited access to bathrooms. I was also meeting my co driver for the first time. We drove 22 hours straight through to deliver the object, it was rough. Yet somehow, I managed not to bleed onto my new work pants or the truck seat.

Luckily, we spent the next night in hotels and I had a chance to rest. The next day, I was having issues getting my menstrual cup to seal properly. Stressful when you have a long drive ahead- any my co-driver somehow only needs to pee when we fill up the 100 gallon tank.

So mid way into the trip, we switch drivers but the station I pulled into didnt have a working restroom. Whoops. I let him know I will need one soon. At this point im very anxious that my cup is leaking or starting to. I spend the next three hours nervously shifting around trying to clench all my muscles in some misplaced hope that I can control the flow. This dude passes by dozens of suitable rest stops and truck stops.  I was pissed and it felt dehumanizing. 

When someone says they need. restroom- why the fuck would you wait three hours? I was considering blurting out details about my flow to get him to understand. On the other hand, I shouldn't need to disclose my menstruation status for my needs to be taken seriously?

This is the only mention of the domestic violence in the whole article: "" According to the police report, Parscale's wife had bruises on both her arms. She said she sustained the injuries 'a few days ago, during a physical altercation with Bradley, which she did not report,' the document said.""

Every single top comment on NPR's article on Facebook is something along the lines of ""Regardless of political party, we all deserve to get mental health help. Hoping he recovers!"" No one is mentioning that he's been found to abuse his wife, Candice Parscale. She literally reported to the police that she was so afraid of him that she ran out of the house, and had to go next door to call 911.

But no, Brad is the real victim here! Someone who has been campaigning for Trump, who is trying to gut the very healthcare system Brad himself needs. I have no pity for this man, and I'm so sick of the media basically just accepting that hurting your wife is expected during a mental health crisis, to the point where they don't feel that part of the story is headline worthy or even more-than-two-sentences worthy.

I was diagnosed with cervical cancer last year, April 2020. Luckily, it was stage 1a1 and I think I'll be okay.. I started getting pap smears every year since I was 21 and it was normal every single year. When I was 25 it came back normal, but positive for HPV type 16. My doctor told me that I'm young and my immune system will fight it off. Come one year later, I had my first abnormal pap, then a colposcopy, then LEEP to remove high grade abnormal cells. The LEEP results came back as cancer. 

A couple weeks later, I went to an oncologist who diagnosed me with stage 1a1, which felt like a miracle. I had convinced myself that if this cancer showed up so quickly it must be super aggressive and I was probably already about to die. Dr. Google told me that only women age 60+ who have already had abnormal paps for several years get cervical cancer. Apparently not. The only treatment I needed was a cervical cone biopsy.

Anyway, my point is please get a pap smear EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Who knows where I'd be if I waited the reccomeded three years. I kept hearing from my doctors how ""unlucky"" I was, but I'm glad I figured that out early. Now I'm just left the mental battle over wether it'll ever come back or not.

r9jyrz,Healthyhooha,1638723641.0,"Wanted to share here cuz it's so wild to me and only person I could tell is my boyfriend. Maybe it will help someone as well. It's a mini novel, so buckle up.

So a few months after getting IUD inserted years back, I couldn't feel my strings. Got seen and was told strings wrapped around my cervix. Totally fine and normal I guess.

Then, 3 yrs ago I had a weekend of camping/romping at a festival with my boyfriend. When I got home, I was showering and noticed I had something in me I could feel that was pea sized and the more I tried to feel it the more I couldn't quite reach it... FREAKED out thought it was a tick or something else foreign. Mind racing at possibilites.
Went to ER at 2am. Male ER dr looked and shrugged saying ""probably a stuck tampon. I'd go to your regular dr in a few days."" Ummm no it's fucking not. He was a cocky guy that reminded me more of a soap opera dr. Dismissive attitude and slick-gelled hair. 800 dollar bill.

At the time, I didn't have a ""set"" gyno or primary care provider, but I was able to schedule a visit with the same female dr who inserted my IUD  a year prior.

She took one look, said all was normal, just that my IUD strings had knotted which was rare but shouldn't be cause for a problem. 

Then started months on and off of an infection, I would take a lot of probiotics or boric acid suppositories, one round of antibiotics; it would clear things up but when I got my period/finished period, infection/weird smells would come back. Periods smelled something AWFUL like rotting :( 

Finally got my new insurance and my first ever general well woman gyno visit scheduled (before I was on my parent's insurance, only got pap smears, IUD insertion, STD testing thru primary.)

The second I'm down on the gyno table, legs spread, she takes one look and says ""OMG something is IN HERE."" 3 people were in the room- nurse, a PA student shadowing, and the doc. Very nerve wracking with all these eyes on me. I was scared, but then remembered 3 yrs ago I was told about the knot. Told her and she said something was attached to the strings and strings are blue, this was a blackish/grey ish color. She said, ""This is absolutely unacceptable and we are getting it out right now."" 
Apparently it was hard for her to cut it out without pulling out my IUD but she was able to do it.

Sorry it's kinda gross but it looked a bit smaller than a peanut, weird greyish color. She thinks it was hair bundled around it or maybe a piece of fuzz or something else got shoved up there when I had put in a tampon and hardened. She said she would not have any doubt in her mind it was throwing off my PH and body kept fighting it.

I had scoured this sub for periods that smelled like death, recurring infections and only saw 1 to 2 posts about something similar and someone said when strings are knotted the gyno should cut it out. So I was relieved to find that post and decided it was time for my first ever true gyno wellness woman exam. I have anxiety and just starting to figure out all this stuff out on my own as age 26 is when you're kicked off parent's insurance in my state.

Long story short...Gyno thinks that it was throwing off my PH. Ran a wet swab and everything else is normal but I did have a PH of 4.5 so borderline with being susceptible to infection. She truly thinks I should be back to healthy again fixing root cause of issues..I feel relieved but also angry that 2 other drs prior to her never thought this should come out of me! 

Tl/dr: strings knotted on IUD. Something attached to it. Body fought it as foreign object, led to recurring infection. Just wanted to share my experience, not to freak someone else out! Overall happy with IUD but if you suspect your strings are knotted, advocate for getting knot snipped off!

z1frwj,WomensHealth,1669078318.0,"I mostly just need to get this off of my chest because I'm miserable.   


I'm honestly over the healthcare journey that I've been on and am genuinely considering just shrugging and letting the precancerous cells turn into cancer. The disrespect for my bodily autonomy and medical gaslighting the whole way has been so uncalled for and maybe if I just straight up have cancer, I'll be listened to. /enddramaticrant  


So, I (28F) had an abnormal pap back in.. July? because I presented for a complaint of sharp pelvic pain in my cervix during sex that lasted several days and wanted my IUD placement checked. The answer was ""oh, yeah, the strings are here, it's there"" and left at that, which I felt frustrated by. I agreed to do a pap two years early because fuck it, new insurance, I'm there, whatever.   


Comes back abnormal. I've had abnormal smears before as a teen, normally it's just been recheck it in 6 months to see if it comes back normal. They push for a colposcopy... and push, and push, so I finally agree, against my wishes because paps are uncomfortable at best and a colpo is painful. I intentionally switched locations (in corporatized healthcare system) because the location I switched to claimed they could do a local anesthetic for it. They lied. I get there in September, get checked in, get to the room, and ask about the local, and they tell me they don't have the type of needle they need to do a local, but it's not painful and it'll take like 2 seconds, so I finally cave on having two women looming over me and demanding that I do it. Behold, it is painful, I scream bloody fucking murder and almost kick the GYN to get her away from me, and they look shocked that I was telling the truth?   (ETA: *and* I just got a $400 bill in the mail for the colpo I didn‚Äôt want today, so that‚Äôs a fun phone call to the insurance company to see why they didn‚Äôt cover it when it was insisted upon as a necessary procedure). 


They make me sign surgical paperwork then and there for the LEEP without getting the results back and tell me they do it under anesthesia (cool!). They tell me they have to remove my IUD for it. I ask if instead of replacing the IUD, we can just do a hysterectomy because I have no intentions of having children (my partner was in the room and agreed that we have no intentions of having children). They say no, insurance won't cover it and it'll be $60k. Okay, I ask if we can do a tubal, they say no again because I'm 28 and childfree.   

I got together the paperwork for the IUD because the GYN was like ""oh well we'll just do one more IUD and then you'll be old enough for us to /think/ about doing sterilization"" just in case but it was bothering me immensely. The concept of pregnancy gives me gender dysphoria like a MF, like, I'll unalive myself if I get pregnant without even considering an abortion first because it's such an extreme squick for me. I called my insurance and double checked that all sterilization is covered - it is - and then I called the office about two weeks ago because I hadn't heard back for surgical scheduling yet and asked if it was an office-wide thing that they don't do tubals or if it's just the one doctor. I got the voicemail back today that it's the whole office because I'm ""28 and don't have any children"" and they ""don't feel comfortable doing it"" while I'm already under anesthesia.   


I'm calling a different GYN office in the morning where the doctor has added herself to the list of providers that provide salpingectomies, but just like... wtf, man, I just want to be listened to for once in my life without being talked down to or treated like I'm lesser by the healthcare system, especially when it's other women perpetuating it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/z1frwj/why_is_womens_healthcare_so_misogynistic/,Why is women's healthcare so misogynistic?,Rant,182,42,0.96,brinakit
lqo8yb,Healthyhooha,1614102226.0,"

When I google how to relieve yeast infections I haven't found very good advice. I've found medication to cure it, but not how to deal with the symptoms at the moment. I've been getting these lately and I've been finding what best works for me to help relieve the symptoms, so now I'm going to post this here in case it helps anyone else.

Side note: listen to your body. If you feel like this is hurting it then stop. This process should be soothing. If it's not, then be more gentle or maybe try something else. If you're itching it along the way, that's fine, but itching it is different than hurting it

Every time I pee or every time I feel too itchy I go through this process to keep the symptoms under control. If I don't do this, then my vaulva gets all itchy and irritated and I feel miserable. 

As soon as I suspect a yeast infection what I do is:

TD; DR (longer version at bottom) 

1) get a cup of water

2) wash hands

3) wash the area with your hands and the water

4) clear all white stuff around the area

5) wash and dry hands again

6) dry the area using just your hands and not toilet paper. TP irritates the area and makes it itchy. Make sure to dry between all the folds and crevasses using your fingers. 

7)most important: always make sure the area is dry after peeing, putting cream on it, or after noticing any discharge around the area.

8) if you decide to use cream, Monistat is a great over-the-counter medicine to use (edit: Vasoline or olive oil is said by commenters to work well too).

9) With any cream make sure to rub it in completely. Cream is wet and wet will make you itchy.  Don't let a bunch just sit there in a puddle on your vulva. The feeling should be similar to what chapstick feels like after putting it on your mouth lips.

10)wear cotton underwear (edit: or nothing)

11)eating yogurt that promotes healthy bacteria is good. Choboni yogurt is great. (Edit: staying away from too much sugar is said by commenters to help the symptoms)

12) if you've been doing great for a while and you're not itchy and then suddenly you start becoming itchy again, then discharge may be coming out of your vagina. So go clean and dry it again.




Longer version:

 After I pee I wash the area outside the vagina with water, only use water. Wash your hands before you start this process. Get a cup of water, so it's right there and ready for you to use, mild cold water works great. I like to put some water in my hand and gently rub while removing discharge 

While washing, clear all the discharge/yeast from the area with your hands. Don't use toilet paper. It irritates the skin. After clearing the discharge your vulva should look all pink with no white stuff anywhere around it. After doing that, clear anything around the asshole too. If you touch the vaginal discharge, wash your hands before you go to the anus and vise versa. Don't spread the infection to other parts.

Side note #2: You should be washing your hands multiple times during this process so you're not spreading anything. 
 
After you clear the discharge, wash and dry your hands again. After that, go back to your vulva and now you're going to dry it

Drying is important. When the area is wet it gets itchier, when it's dry it's less itchy. So make sure you dry it, but you have to do it a certain way or else it will get itchy and irritated again

To do this, you need to dry all the little folds and crevasses of your vulva, use your freshly washed and dried hands to do this. Don't use toilet paper... However, you can use toilet paper to help dry off the surrounding area, but not all the little folds and crevasses. Toilet paper will irritate things, so be careful with that 

After you're done drying then you are good. You may still feel itchy, but it should hopefully feel better than before 

Other useful things:

If you wear underwear wear cotton underwear. This is super important. Don't wear underwear that feels like cotton, but isn't. Some materials trap moisture and makes the yeast infections worse. Pure cotton consistently dries the area as it gets wet and somehow doesn't trap the moisture there. Wear that or wear nothing 

If you have a cream meant for yeast infections (edit: or vasoline) use that. If you don't have it, that's ok, I would suggest buying something though. Being dry is good, but having some sort of cream to let the skin slip around without getting stuck to each other is really good (edit: someone mentioned olive oil working for this. I haven't tried it, but it's worth noting). I like using the Monistat cream, but use whatever works

If you put cream around the area to help with itchiness don't let it bunch up and just sit there. Its wet and wetness makes the skin itchy. Put it on after you clean the vulva, then rub it in well, then basically dry it again, while keeping the area a tad slippery (similar feeling to how chapstick feels after putting it on mouth lips).

Change underwear frequently or don't wear it at all

Eat yogurt that promotes good bacteria. Choboni yogurt works well

FYI: idk if doing all this will help cure the infection. I'm assuming it won't help cure it. This guide is meant to help make the symptoms bearable, but don't wait and see if they'll clear up with this. Go get some over-the-counter YI medicine or antibiotics or something.

If anyone else tries this and/or has any feedback of their own on how to handle yeast infections, feel free to share. I'd like to read about it 

Edit: I gave up sugar for unrelated reasons and found that my yeast infections completely went away, so really watch your sugar intake or maybe try taking a break from it all together

Male Condom: Worn by a man, this common method has a typical-use failure rate of 13%.

FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVES

Female Condom: Worn inside a woman, the failure rate is 21%.

Oral contraceptives (The Pill): The combined-hormone version has a typical-use failure rate of 7%. The progestin-only version, which I am on currently since the combined version causes me to vomit, also has a 7% rate of failure.

Hormone Patch: Worn for three weeks, followed by one week without. Failure rate is 7%.

Contraceptive ring (hormonal): Worn for three weeks, removed for a week, then replaced. Again, the failure rate is 7%. 

Spermicides: Foam, gel, cream, film, suppository, or tablet that is supposed to kill sperm inside the vagina. Failure rate is 21%. Note that spermicides may be present on male condoms. 

Arm Implant (Nexplanon, Implanon): A thin rod is inserted into a woman‚Äôs arm, releasing hormones for up to 3 years. Failure rate is 0.1%. (I used this for several years and suffered excess weight gain, severe migraines, and depression).

Injection (The Shot): A progestin shot given every three months. Failure rate is 4%.

Fertility Tracking: Monitoring your menstrual cycle to help track fertile windows. Failure rates range from 2-23%. 

Intrauterine Device (IUD): There are hormonal versions which can be used for 3 to 6 years and have a failure rate of 0.1 to 0.4%. There is also the hormone-free copper version, which lasts for up to 10 years and has a failure rate of 0.8%. (I had the copper IUD for 3 years before I started bleeding randomly; after 87 days of non-stop bleeding and a fight to get an ultrasound, it was found the IUD was turned sideways and implanted in the wall of my uterus. I loved this contraceptive method, but there are risks involved, some which can be very serious).

I‚Äôd also like to draw attention to a glaring discrepancy in the number of available contraceptive methods for men versus women.

Note that I didn‚Äôt even include other female methods like diaphragms, sponges, the lactational amenorrhea method, or permanent sterilization.

No, I was not married to this man, but then I am a godless harlot who believes in the mental and physical benefits of a healthy sex life. America as we know it was founded by immigrants seeking freedom from religious prosecution (and achieved that ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù through genocide of the existing residents of North America). Today, we have moved backwards in more ways than one; I feel as though some of us are now seeking freedom from prosecution for lacking a religion. 

In a recent study along the U.S.-Mexico border, it was found that majority of abortion-seekers were between 20-29 years old (59.7% of sample population), over 65% were in their first trimester (within 12 weeks of conception), and most had to travel hundreds of miles to reach a clinic offering abortion services (Leyser-Whalen et al, 2021).

Comparing my personal experience, I was just about to turn 21, am estimated to have reached 12-13 weeks along, and had to travel 165 miles to the nearest clinic. Keep in mind that I had scheduled the appointment at 7 weeks; the first available appointment was more than a month after my call for help. 

Want to hear about the procedure? No? Well, that is unfortunate, because this is too important not to be shared. 

I arrived at the clinic, which was surprisingly quiet so early that Montana morning. No protestors. I filled out some paperwork, was asked several times if I was sure about my choice and then was escorted to the waiting room. There were two other women in the room, both who had their partners with them; I sat alone. One woman was in the corner --- I never heard her speak a word to her companion or anyone else. The woman to my left was very chatty. Holding her husband‚Äôs hand, she told me how she had been diagnosed with post-partum depression after the birth of her first child, how she could not go through that again. She says they were careful.

After what felt like an eternity (but was only a little over an hour), I was escorted to a sort of holding room. There, the nurse explained what would happen during the procedure. I was given an ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy and establish gestational age. The ultrasound was shown to me. They gave me some pill that is supposed to soften the cervix, making manual dilation easier. After the medication had time to work, I was taken to see the doctor. My legs in stirrups, with the doctor and one nurse between my legs, and another woman, perhaps a CNA or another nurse, holding my hand, a thin tool was used to dilate my cervix. It took a few subsequently larger sizes before they could proceed. 

My most vivid memory during this process is the extreme pain --- I was awake during it all. There had been some sort of numbing swab applied, but like when the dentist goes starts drilling your teeth, it wasn‚Äôt enough. I squeezed that poor woman‚Äôs hand as hard as I possibly could, feeling dizzy, with the distinct sensation that someone had dumped ice-water over my head which then ran down my body. This, of course, makes no sense since that would require water to fall horizontally. I could feel the sensation of suction inside my body. I felt so dizzy. After the procedure was completed, I sat up with the help of the older nurse who had been at the doctor‚Äôs side. She helped clean up the blood from between my legs and assisted me in applying the thickest sanitary napkin I have ever seen in my life. 

After taking several minutes to make sure I would not pass out, I was helped to an adjacent recovery room. I stayed there for over an hour and was given 800 mg of ibuprofen, some juice, and a small pack of mini cookies. There was another woman there, also post-procedure, who I had not seen before. Soon after my arrival, the chatty woman from the first waiting room arrived; she was much less talkative. While recovering, the nurse spent time with me discussing a wide variety of contraceptive methods. I got a whole packet of information, and together, we decided that it was worth trying the arm implant Nexplanon, since this whole ordeal started while I was on the pill, and the arm implant had a lower failure rate. Then it was over. 

Or so I thought. For the next six-ish months, I was in a fog. I was paranoid every time my period was due, accompanied by the awful PMS I am so used to. For someone who has an irregular cycle, the delay in the arrival of the bleeding is anxiety-inducing. I‚Äôm nauseous --- I must be pregnant (though that would require some divine conception for my presently abstinent self). I‚Äôm cramping; pregnant. I have a headache; pregnant. That smells weird; pregnant. Though every ounce of logic said these worries were physically impossible, my mind would not stop telling me that I would have to go through this process all over again. I cried so, so much. I was scared to let anyone touch me. I am crying now as I spill my story. My choice. 

Was this a difficult decision? The most. Do I still think about what may have been? Yes, though it is less often now, ten years later. Do I regret my choice? Never. 

Had I carried this person‚Äôs baby to term, there would be a permanent tie to a person who verbally threatened to kill me (and don‚Äôt forget the hidden ammo story). If I had ended up with a child from this relationship that I never should have been in, I would be dead. No, not from a botched procedure, maybe not from this person‚Äôs violence, but from myself. I was in such a dark place, emotionally drained, scared, confused. I would have killed myself. I tried it. Thankfully, I didn‚Äôt do a great job. 

Ten years have passed. I am engaged to a wonderful man, the kindest, most supportive, most logical person I have ever known. He respects me. He understands the choices that I have made. We love each other, and we hope to try for a family soon. I have been seeing a therapist, my depression is part of me, but I have learned healthy ways to process the challenges that we encounter.
 
Friends will likely be lost after sharing this story. I know that some of my family is very strongly against abortion, and I understand that they may no longer wish to speak with me. People may never see me in the same way they did before, for better or worse. 

I cannot say that I don‚Äôt care what they think, because I truly do. If I didn‚Äôt care, this story would have been shouted from the rooftops in November 2013. I am scared. But I believe that my experience is important. The attack on healthcare is too important to ignore. I can‚Äôt take it for granted that things will all work out that way I would hope for, so here is my story. My choice.

1599bvi,Healthyhooha,1690293548.0,"This post is targetted towards young people who are going to have sex and are curious about it.

As a young woman, I was scared of sex due to lack of valid and useful available information on it. I did not have penetrative sex for a long time out of this fear mostly (apart from the fact that I was not prepared for it).

The idea that something enters a delicate part of my body was scary. I asked my peers who have had sex if sex is supposed to hurt. 
My friend, a woman who had had sex by then, chuckled and said, ""the pain is the fun part"", in all sincerity.

But when I had sex, I realised that it is not supposed to hurt.  AT ALL!
There will be some discomfort when something first penetrates you since your body is new to this sensation, but if you're mentally and physically ready, and have had a nice build up till penetration, it should not hurt at all.

There can be some pain the first time, which is completely normal. But my suggestion would be to not continue having sex through the pain, especially if you're deriving no pleasure from it. You should stop and resume when you feel ready. I don't have a lot of knowledge on this for the first time scenarios. But I can say that even now, whenever I experience pain during penetrative sex, I immediately stop. And I can resume again when the pain is gone and I feel ready for some action again.

You should also keep some fragrance-free lube handy (never skimp on lube, always invest in quality). And don't ever skip using a condom. Get a basic plain condom of good quality. Don't go for textured condoms when you're just starting out.
If your partner refuses to use condoms citing stupid reasons, don't let them anywhere near your body. If your sexual health is compromised, you're the one suffering. 

For anyone like me, who is worried about the same, please bear in mind that your safety is the most important part. Don't have sex with someone who doesn't feel safe, especially for your first time.

I am not a medical practitioner, but as a fellow vagina-haver, this is what have realised and experienced. And I wanted to make this available for someone like me who is worried about this.

If you're having penetrative sex for the first time, make sure you are ready and more importantly willing for it. If you experience pain, immediately stop whatever you are doing. If the pain persists, please go to a doctor and get it checked out.

You might stay sore for a day or two after you have sex. But make sure to see a doctor if it's pain.

I don't have much knowledge about vaginal conditions that might cause such issues, but it is common knowledge that penetration -- without any underlying medical conditions -- should NOT hurt you.

Edit 1: advice on using lube and condoms.

Edit 2: elaborated on the bit about having medical conditions that might cause pain or persistent discomfort. PLEASE GO TO A DOCTOR. DON'T STAY IN PAIN. You should at least know what is causing pain.

1ctpflj,WomensHealth,1715897532.0,"Hi Ladies, I need advice. I'm planning on leaving a review and reporting him to the Texas Medical Board but I feel like I'm going crazy and don't feel justified in reporting. I'd like to hear what y'all think (TLDR at bottom) 

2 days ago I noticed what looked like a boil or cyst on my right labia. Yesterday this boil started to grow and become very irritated making it hard to sit down and hurt to walk around. I checked google and started putting a warm compress on it throughout the day to get it to drain naturally but knew I would probably need to get antibiotics to keep from infection. The boil (now know it was a cyst) was about 1cm big, pea-edamame sized and looked like it was possibly infected, hence the urgent care trip, and very red and inflamed. Wanted to be safe rather than sorry and decided it was better to go get antibiotics and start them that night just in case it started draining. It was pretty late at night and there was only 1 urgent care open, which was not the urgent care I typically went to. 

Get to the urgent care, fill out the papers. Receptionist sees my paperwork and lets me know they only have a male doctor, and if that would be ok. Male doctors doing my exams in sensitive areas wasn't my favorite thing. Had some good experiences, had some bad. I said it was fine, since I assumed he was just going to examine if it looked infected and maybe prescribe some antibiotics. Wait for a bit in the waiting room then the nurse pulls me back for vitals. She was extremely sweet, talked about her bartholin's cyst and how it sounded like that could possibly be my problem. She told me to get undressed from the waist down, gave me a cover up, and she let me know she would be in the room with me while the doctor took a look.

Doctor comes into the room. It was an older man in his 70's or 80's. He did not introduce himself, he did not ask me what I was in for. I said hello, tried to start talking about my problem and he interrupts me with just a ""show me it."". Rude and weird as we haven't even had a conversation yet but whatever, it's late at night. 

I get on my back, there were no sternups or anything so I kind of awkwardly had my legs frog style. He immediately began touching the area- which was very red and tender and painful without a single word. Not a huge fan of that. My gyno's and dr's have always told me what they were about to do, especially when touching in or around my vagina. I asked him to tell me if it looked infected, if I could just let it drain and if I would need antibiotics (been super anxious about sepsis recently which was the biggest factor for coming in). He mentions that it looked like it may have started draining and then asked the nurse to grab him a paper towel. 

Suddenly I felt a huge stinging pain on the area where the cyst was. Enough to make me yelp in pain and scoot back from him. He was popping my cyst. Popping it! No lancing, no gentle squeezing, no pain relief, NOTHING! He hadn't even wiped the area before popping a cyst, possibly making it more infected if it wasn't already. After the first wave of pain, nearly passing out he kept squeezing very hard I said ""that hurts really bad can you stop?"" and he did not stop. He squeezed again, and I yelped again and said ""I'm serious I haven't had any ibuprofen or anything this hurts so bad please stop"". Still no words spoken to me at this point. I was pissed, and in a lot of pain. I had wanted it to drain naturally because I didn't want to risk any extra scarring even with a cut or lance, but I will get even worse scarring from this doctor popping it! He took the paper towel and kept wiping and I winced in pain and told him to seriously stop touching it. He finally backed off, and waddled over to his clipboard all without saying a single word to me. The female nurse was in the room, silent this entire time- mind you.

He finally spoke up to ask me how much I weighed and if I was allergic to any medications because now that it's ruptured I needed to be on antibiotics immediately so I don't get infected. I couldn't believe what had just happened. He had not asked me if I wanted it ""drained"" if you could even call it that. He had not talked to me about what he was going to do. And if he had listened to me as he waddled over, he would have heard me say that I've been doing warm compresses to get it to drain naturally. I had to ask the female nurse for a panty liner so that I wasn't (TMI) leaking puss and blood all over my panties while I waited 45 minutes at a CVS to start my antibiotics. He left the room, without sharing any aftercare, without asking me if I had any questions. Nothing, just left. I just have this big gaping wound on my labia that I guess I'm just trying to keep clean and not pee on?

I have gotten cysts drained before at doctors offices, by the way. Cysts on my vaginal opening and urethral opening have been drained at gyno appointments. They are supposed to give you some kind of local numbing and it is done on request with either a lance or a cut. They certainly didn't squeeze-pop them without consent and they were explaining everything they were doing, before doing it. And the most important thing was when the pain was bad and I said ""break"" or ""stop"" and they would stop. 

I left the clinic feeling violated. I'm upset that this cyst is going to scar more because he ruptured it without a care in the world. I had not asked him to drain my cyst on any kind of paperwork. I am upset he had not asked for any kind of consent before doing it. I was not there on request of a cyst draining. I had requested an exam to check for infection and to possibly get antibiotics. 

I will be following up with my primary care physician, just to check for damage and proper aftercare instructions. I am planning on leaving a review on the clinics google page, which I found also had a few 1 star reviews about ""the older gentleman"" that took care of them. I want to also report to the medical board, but I have no strong evidence against him. I am a SA victim, and I'm already very uncomfortable with people touching me in that area. And I feel like he scarred me without my consent. 

Any and all advice or support is greatly needed right now <3

TLDR: Went to doctor for centimeter sized cyst on labia to examine if it was infected and to get antibiotics. Male doctor refused to speak to me, and squeeze-popped my cyst without talking to me, without consent, without pain relief and refused to stop squeezing after I had asked him to stop, twice. My risk of infection is higher, and the area is going to scar. Left me no aftercare instructions. Gave me antibiotic prescription. This was a \*non-emergency\* urgent care trip.

So my mom outta nowhere today brings up the fact that she hasn't gotten laid in a while. She's 68 and my dad's in his early 70s. I come from an an immigrant (but very open-minded) Asian household so this definitely took me by surprise. But anyway, I asked her questions and she confessed that she couldn't get wet anymore so she has trouble w penetration. I ended up giving her this Aloe Vera lotion/lube that I use to moisturize when it's super dry out (I recently moved to a high altitude city). And I also bought her a lil vibrator so she could... Well, practice. Lol. 

Except I'm in my 20s and have no idea what other advice to give her! I don't know anything about what you experience after menopause, what happens to your hormones and body as you age.... I also don't know what advice to give her if she wants to get dad into this!! We don't know if he's working down there either lolol. Help!

Edit:

You are all so wonderful and lovely. So many supportive messages and I've learned so much in a short period of time. I've copied my comment I made in the r/menopause sub. This is what I've learned so far from all of you and want to make sure that I'm understanding it all correctly!


1) Have mom see a gyno and get professional help. Unfortunately with covid and their age/health, that sadly can't happen as soon as we want to but an appointment has been scheduled for late spring! 

2) Until then, invest in some Hyaluronic Acid. I was able to get some Good Clean Love BioNourish Moisturizing Gel. This is used to help with dryness and atrophy (which is basically the vagina cells deteriorating due to age, menopause, and decrease in sexual activity). So this is kind of like an every day lotion to keep your vagina nice and happy. This is not a substitute from lube. 

3) Have mom self-stimulate for the time being to get ""back into it"". She wants to test the waters herself first before getting dad involved. I got her a vibrator and she seems to be more interested in clitoral stimulation than penetration (which is good baby steps anyway!) If she's not going in, do we need lube?? Or will the Hyaluronic moisturizing gel be enough? We got both just in case but don't want her to be making a whole mess üòÇ

4) if penetrating sex were to be the next step (which won't be anytime soon), there will be a LOT of precautions we need to take. Because the vagina has undergone atrophy, the walls will be thin and prone to pain and damage. Meaning we can't do anything here until we go see a Gyno/Pelvic therapist. Hypothetically, they may prescribe estrogen cream or other things that could best case scenario help bring back mom's vagina to life, or worst case scenario, it's super painful and we will figure an alternative from there! 

Please give me any critiques or suggestions! I'm laying this out as i want to ensure I'm understanding this all correctly when I translate this to my mom.

I have tried so many treatments for BV.. I went to the doctor so many times and they always prescribe me antibiotics that work only for the duration of the medication course.

I tried boric acid suppositories but they only gave temporary relief. I tried taking a 90 billion probiotic daily for months but it didnt do anything (I think the probiotics were not surviving inside me).

I thought I will experiment with eating yoghurt before taking my probiotic pill. I just have plain low fat yogurt and then I take my 90 billion womens pro biotic every day in the morning.

I have started doing this for one week only and I would say my symptoms have reduced by around 60% ! The dreaded smell has thankfully reduced a lot and the discharge amount is also much less! I have faith that if I continue with this it might finally cure my BV by slowly and consistently re-culturing my gut with good bacteria. I think yogurt is basically a REALLY good vessel for the bacteria.

I tried multiple rounds of medications including long term treatment plans with my doctor and i am having little to no relief.

I finally booked in to see a gynaecologist yesterday and after explaining all the treatments i have tried and how much pain and discomfort i am in she told me i need to lower my expectations, we probably won‚Äôt be able to stop it coming back but we will try to manage the symptoms.

She's so great and as long as my numbers were good, she didn't bother me too much about my being heavy, but this was 100% caused by age and weight. I'm currently down 45 lbs with a goal of 100 by next summer. 

Last night I was taking a shower and felt something weird while I was washing my labia. I thought it was a piece of synthetic braiding hair (weave/extensions) or a piece of a panty liner or tampon since I just finished my period and had braided my hair recently. 

SO I PULLED IT. 

It was, you guessed it, my IUD strings. I could never feel them before because the way my fat was distributed, I had lost some range of motion in my arms. I was also able to put my leg up on the tub when I shower again. When I realized it wasn't coming out without a fight,  it dawned on me what it was and I left it alone About 10 minutes later I feel the cramps starting. I wake up this morning and I have cramps but it also feels like I'm wearing a spiky tampon that wouldn't go all the way in. First thing in the morning I make an appointment to get it checked. Doc said I dislodged it alright and that it was sitting all wonky up against my cervix and he couldn't believe I'd gone to work like this. It hurt to sit too long, but I would get up to walk periodically.

He pulls it out and asks how I liked it or if I wanted to switch to something else like the paraguard.  I jokingly said, ""can you just tie my tubes and call it a day"" and he flips through my chart and says, ""If that's what you want, it's irreversible, but I'm sure you know if you're wanting to have a kid. Get scheduled for a pre-op eval on your way out"". 

My mouth was on the floor.  I don't have kids and haven't ever wanted them, but he didn't even question that. I said I thought it would be harder to convince him and he said, ""well you're almost 37, You know if you want ever be pregnant. If you were 19, I'd be hesitant. I'd still do it, but I'd make you take time to think about it."" And just like that,  I'm scheduled for a tubal ligation. I don't think it would have happened if I hadn't lost that weight.

In early February my doctor sent samples she collected to the CDC for antibiotic resistance testing. The results came back early this week and I had an appointment yesterday.

My infection came back as completely resistant to metronidazole (Flagyl) and highly resistant to Tinidazole the only other option for treatment in the United States. There is one more treatment regimen for me to try. If this fails I am looking at having to deal with trich for the rest of my life.

This would mean never having sex again. It also means I will never be able to have a child. The likelihood of me being able to adopt is also slim to none. The worst part of this is the daily pain and the toll this is taking on my already fragile mental health.

A few weeks ago, I had to go to the airport to pick up a package after work. As I was standing at the counter dealing with customs I noticed a soldier and a young woman, both in their early 20s, sitting on a bench. She was holding a dishevelled Welcome Home sign and both looked terribly dejected. The counter person told me their flight home had been cancelled and the next wasn't until 11ish the next morning. He'd found this out when he charged their phone for them. The young lady had flown in to surprise her husband and had a party waiting at home.

As I was finishing up my business, I saw the girl heading for the loo. She looked so distraught I thought she might welcome a bit of support. It seems they'd been married less than a month before he was deployed. He'd been gone for a year and this was her big romantic surprise, months in the planning, and it had all fallen apart after all the saving up for her plane ticket and all. It seems they were due to move to his new posting and needed all their money for the move. All they could do was stay at the airport until their flight. I did my best to make her feel better but seeing this young love's joy thwarted by circumstance broke my heart. We chatted on a bit before she returned to snuggle in beside her soldier again.

I returned to the counter, picked up my package, and started for my car before something inside just said, ""**No!**"" I walked over to the couple and offered them a hotel room on me for the night. I insisted that it would be on me as a thank you both for his service and as a belated wedding present. Back and forth, back and forth, and next we knew we were at the hotel our company used for business guests. I told the concierge to put dinner, the room, and breakfast on my card. We hugged and said our goodbyes and I felt wonderful for days. And still do when I think about it.

Today, my card statement came. Total charge: $22. I called the hotel. It seems someone in the dining room picked up their dinner. Someone else paid for their room. And a third guest paid for their breakfast. I paid for the room cleaning tip. People ask me why I want to be an American citizen. THIS is just one of the reasons. I'm told they sent a thank you letter and pictures of their new home to me at the freight office. It will be a day or two before I receive it, but all that will do is extend the happiness I have in the real America, not the America of the politicians. Sometimes giving support to another woman in distress, no matter how big or small, can do more for you than you'd ever expect. Allow yourself to feel as wonderful as I do. Please help if you can.

I made a post yesterday on a booktuber""s (book review and discussion youtuber) subreddit to point out that a lot if the genres that he talks about, and even some of the books he endorses, are filled with misogyny or just seem to not acknowledge that women exist and are humans with normal human thoughts and emotions. I said that it'd be great if he came up with a set of books that are specifically woman-friendly, because, you know, we're a huge portion of the population and deserve novels that aren't bigoted against us??

jcvjit,Healthyhooha,1602943018.0,"Hello friends,

Edited EDIT *sigh*: I realized that it may not be clear that we DO allow NSFW photos here for users over the age of 18, but the rule broken most often is the one that states *it must be linked in the comments*. As in, make a text post about it, and then comment on your own post with the photo link. 

We don‚Äôt want any photos popping up in the main feed even if they are blurred. They don‚Äôt always reliably blur on all versions of Reddit. We prefer the community have to go through a few clicks to actually get to them if they‚Äôd like to offer advice or feedback. 

I‚Äôd also like to say that I almost always end up looking at the photos posted, especially the recent ones, and the overwhelming majority of the time, what is pictured is 100% NORMAL. And this is exactly *why* we continue to allow them- for all of us to normalize our bodies. 

The AutoMod that will instantly filter direct photos AND photo links in posts is up and running. It will remove them from the main feed instantly, send it to our modqueue for review (in case other things get caught, like a regular link to a website or something, in which case we could approve it), and post an automatic comment informing the OP that it was removed, why, and what to do about it.

I'm also adding in a sidebar rule for inclusive language. The mods had discussed this in the past few months but hadn't gotten around to implementing it - apologies for that. For example, we prefer that if you start your post with some sort of greeting, that it needs to be gender neutral. Meaning - we are here for trans men and any sort of gender-nonconforming individuals that have vaginas. It's super tempting to start a post with ""Hey ladies, need help with xyz!"" but that needs to either be skipped altogether, or use something like ""friends"" or something similar. We also won't tolerate any downvoting of posts or comments from individuals who identify as something besides ""woman"". The text of the rule will be as follows (thanks to u/theadedb for the text):

""The mod team would like to give an emphatic reminder that this community was created to help all people who have vaginas and vulvas regardless of gender identity or expression. This sub purposefully uses gender neutral language to create a welcoming environment for all users. Any downvoting or negative comments related to someone‚Äôs gender identity or expression will not be tolerated.""

We have some other fun ideas being processed too (think AMAs and Megathreads, like some of the big subs do!), but I want to converse with the mods first.

This particular time, the ingrown was so deep into the skin and it was getting bigger. It quite possibly was on it‚Äôs way to being a big problem. I had to have surgery before because an ingrown hair turned into a large abscess. I was not going back. 

I attempted to use an acne wash and toner with salicylic acid. It helped to bring the pus up to the surface, but the skin was still smooth like a baby. I used Hibiclens, an antibacterial skin wash, to keep the bacteria and dirt at bay. Bump still refuses to go down.

Finally, on day 5 of battle, I saw something about baking soda reducing redness and irritation. Definitely wanted that because the bump hurt. I did it before bed.

I mixed baking soda with water, and used a napkin to dab it on and around the bump. It helped with the irritation and redness within 10 minutes. Rinsed it off.

I just checked it 5 hours later - and the bump finally busted and released the pus! It‚Äôs gone down extremely well. I guess the baking soda helped release it from that last layer of skin.

m7tc8f,Periods,1616081429.0,"So today was the first time in my life my period pain was taken seriously. I tried to be listened to for more than 10 years and I was always being told that every woman goes through pain and that it's normal.

My period are 12 days long and I can't walk or get out of my bed for 2 to 3 days when I have pain. I have to miss work (or school when I was younger) every month. I cry, I have nausea and pass out from the pain once in a while.

My last period was the worst of my life. I was in so much pain I could not even move a muscle, cry or talk. I passed out from it. It was easily a 10/10 pain. I had stopped trying to get listened to for the last 3 years because I thought it was a lost cause, but having this horrible pain made me realize I should fight to be listened to. So yesterday I talked with a super sweet nurse but she told me I had no choice but to pledge my case to a GP if I want to ba able to see a gynecologist (I live in Quebec). So she told me all the things I should mention to the GP to be listened to, and it worked! Here are the tips she gave me:

\- Start by mentioning that you tried to get help on many occasions but nobody wants to help you.

\- Mention how long your period lasts (in my case, 12 days) and that you know that period this long is not normal

\- Mention the number of days you are in pain, tell them the pain can go up to X/10

\- Describe the pain in details so they can live it. In my case, I told them I was bedridden (the nurse insisted it was important to use this term) for 2 to 3 days every month, I told them I had to miss work every month, that I'm non-functional, can't walk, crying, stabbing pain that goes down to my legs, nauseas, passing out, hot flashes.

\- Tell them how the pain affects you. Example: I can't go to work and can't walk. (thanks to unknowncalicocat for pointing that out)

She also told me to keep fighting, and that if the next GP doesn't believe me, to go to the next one until someone wants to help me.

Also, my sister pointed to me a resource of all the female-friendly gynecologists in Quebec: [http://gynecopositive.com/en/home/](http://gynecopositive.com/en/home/). If the GP would not have listened to me that was my backup.

I know I'm far from being the only one to have been ignored for so long. Keep fighting and one day someone will want to help you. It's not in your head and you're not exaggerating or attention-seeking. Don't let them talk you down.

amh06q,Healthyhooha,1549133240.0,"Hello! The advice from this community fixed my infection problems, so I thought I'd make a summary post as a thank you. I'm thrilled to finally have a handle on this problem and I hope this post can help someone else.

**Backstory:** Ever since I became sexually active, I would develop an infection. Often I'd get all 3 at once. It didn't matter if it was oral or sex on the pill, it happened every time. Conventional advice like ""pee after sex"" and ""eat yogurt"" did nothing. Before this subreddit, doctors and I were convinced that birth control was the problem. I switched between nearly 10 types of birth control pills and Nexplanon. OBGYNs were not much help - the most useful advice I ever got was to take a probiotic, but that wasn't enough by itself.

## My Regimen

**Every morning**

1.  Take 1x probiotic made for vaginal health. 
2.  Take 2x 500mg D-Mannose.

**Directly after sex**

1. Immediately push fluids out of me. I will also wash my hands and gently scoop anything out of my vagina.
2. Pee.
3. Take 1x 500mg D-Mannose.

**Once per week**

1. Insert 1 vaginal boric acid suppository.

The probiotic targets yeast, the boric acid raises the pH of the vagina to prevent BV, and the D-Mannose makes your bladder walls slippery so no bacteria can stick and cause a UTI. One time I skipped my after-sex thing, and started to feel BV/yeast happening. I put in boric acid at night for 2 nights and that completely fixed it. I know that boric acid is an intense treatment, but I had tried everything else. What works for me may not be necessary for you.

Lemme know if you have any questions!

Boyfriend was annoyed/hurt and she was asking how to make it right. All that is well and good. I get the freezing in panic mode, I even get her boyfriend being a little peeved (in the post she made him seem pretty reasonable, not pissed off).


But what upsets me was all of the men in the comments spouting BS about ""He's just shooting his shot, whats the big deal?"" ""Just say no and move on.""


It reminded me of my post about being inappropriately approached at work, when men were saying the same shit. And so many other posts by women being upset with men's advances. Men just freak in the comment section about how we're being so moody, why are we getting so upset? It's no big deal. It's a compliment. Just say no, what's the big deal?


I just want to fucking exist in a public space! I just want to walk through the grocery store without the creepy janitor following me around making horrible jokes! I want to walk down the street without the construction workers across the street wolf whistling at me! I want to walk into the gym and not have to position myself so men can't Leer at my ass while I'm doing squats! I want to give my phone number to the people at the doctor's office without worrying that one of them is going to text me from their personal phone to ask me back to their place! I don't want to be afraid of what's going to happen to me when I reject these men.


And men get to go through the world with confidence eithout being objctified and sexualized and leered at and stalked, and then they whine at us when we just want to EXIST in a public space and have that same experience.


MEN DON'T ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SHOOT THEIR SHOT. Saying that's what they were doing does not excuse their creepy ass behavior! You could have just walked tf away and left me in peace. You could have refrained from texting me. You could have just controlled your damn hormones. You are not entitled to my patience, my acceptance of your advances, my politeness. And I just wish men would get their heads out of their asses and realize what these behaviors do to the women around them.


But no matter how many times we say that its NOT okay in the comments of every post like that, men just can't seem to wrap their heads around the fact that our opinion on the matter is more valid and more important than theirs, and they love to tell us how wrong we are about the horrible experiences we've been through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/j3wl5k/im_just_so_tired_of_screaming_into_the_wind_that/,I'm just so tired of screaming into the wind that inappropriate advances are not okay,Vent/Discussion Post ,173,30,0.99,nenorei

I can't go on vacation, have spontaneous sex, wear the cute underwear I want, or do anything without worry of how my body will punish me. I've tried tons of birth control, all of which just exacerbates issues I already have, or it creates new ones. If I can end or even reduce the amount of bleeding I have to go through and not worry about getting pregnant it would be a couple less things to have to deal with not just month after month, but honestly every single day.
I'm 37, my husband and I don't want kids, and I'm so *beyond fucking done* with this. I'm terrified of how much this will cost, but I can't go on living this way. I'm nervous but excited!

My current bf of almost two years has ruined my life 

Before my bf and I started dating we saw other people. I was seeing one guy and he was seeing one girl. The guy (who was a good friend of mine) only slept with one girl who is as clean as a whistle when it comes to STD health. Now my bf who was seeing this girl before we started dating never told me how often she got around and how he had unprotected sex with her on multiple occasions. He never told me that part until I started feeling bad down there. 

In the June of 2019, which was a few months after we became official, I started feeling awful in my vagina. After months of multiple OB/GYNs telling me it was a yeast infection, one OB/GYN who knew what to test for told me I had Trichomoniasis. I was floored and asked how could I of gotten this? Ive only been with my bf since March. She told me it had to come from somewhere. I was so sad and shaken. I asked my bf if he cheated and he said no, so I asked if he had unprotected sex with that girl and he sighed and admitted he had. I was furious he hid that from me. I called my friend who I slept with to let him know what I had. He told me he had no symptoms and neither did the girl he started seeing at the time. My bf got tested and was negative. I took antibiotics and that was the end of that, or so I thought.

Fast forward to September of this year. I feel weird again. I see an OB/GYN and he tells me I have a YI. Gave me cream and diflucan and nothing worked. About two weeks later he calls and said I have Trich...
I called my bf crying and asked if he cheated on me. He said he hadn‚Äôt and went to get tested, and came back negative. This time they gave him an antibiotic to be on the safe side. 

Fast forward to now, I am miserable. I was tested after my course of Metrodonizole and I no longer have an Trich, but for the past 3 months, I cannot rid of a YI I got from the STD and the antibiotics. I tried creams, boric acid, cutting back sugar, probiotics, and nothing is working. I have thrown so much money at appointments and medications and it is starting to add up.

I am trying so hard to not be mad at my bf because I do love him and it was a careless accident but I cannot help sort of resenting him. I am uncomfortable every minute of every day and have to eat like a rabbit so symptoms of my YI do not get worse. I have such low self-esteem and cry all the time from being fed up of not getting better. I know he feels terrible and tries to help cook non-sugar meals for me but if he didn‚Äôt hide his past, I wouldn‚Äôt be suffering now. 

Has anyone had a successful regime to get rid of YI that won‚Äôt go away? I am so tired...

I looked up yeast infection symptoms, but it didn‚Äôt match. And my gynecologist never said anything like ‚ÄúYou have a yeast infection!‚Äù 

Well I went to my annual Pap smear last week. My gynecologist noticed I had an abnormal amount of discharge and decided to swab for ureaplasma, a type of mycoplasma that affects roughly 80% of women. I came back positive!

Apparently this natural-occurring bacteria can overwhelm the female reproductive and urinary tract and cause issues like UTIs, miscarriages, infertility. However, it‚Äôs not well known. Below are a couple articles I found very helpful and relatable. 

If you experience symptoms like I do and those described in the articles, ask your gynecologist to do a ureaplasma culture!

Is there something about modern life that makes us more susceptible to YIs and BV? I mean a course of antibiotics will do a number on you for a couple of weeks, yeah, but all of this?

I have been seeing a lot of posts saying that people are treating their UTIs at home with things like cranberry juice, rather than being seen by a physician. While it's true that Cranberry juice can *help* a UTI, it should not be used as a **cure.**

I work in infectious disease for a living and I cannot tell you how often I see patients here with insanely dangerous symptoms caused by UTIs; not only physical affects, but affects that can mimic conditions like Schizophrenia. In addition, UTIs that go untreated can lead to more serious conditions like bladder and kidney infections, kidney failure, permanent kidney damage and even sepsis, which is life threatening.

If you suspect you have a UTI, please call your doctor. A UTI doesn't always require urgent or emergency care but you should have a urinalysis performed and take any antibiotics you may be prescribed.

Things we recommend to our patients to help prevent UTIs are urination after sex, drinking plenty of water, maintaining good hygiene down there, wiping from front to back and/or taking a supplement like D-Mannose.

Within two months, my dr wanted to give me a hysterectomy due to the pain and the clots I had. I refused because I was only 24 and didn‚Äôt want to be on medication for hormones for the rest of my life.   They ran different test and a endo biopsy and everything came back negative. For 8 years i suffered two weeks a month, bed bound due to the crippling pain I was in (hence the endo biopsy and my mom has endo). I started seeking different OBs and they all kept telling me it‚Äôs ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. No, clots the size of half dollars are NOT *normal*. 
Well a little over a year ago, I ended up in the ER due to a kidney stone and the ER dr came into my room and asked if I knew one of my clips had migrated. 
Migrated‚Ä¶.. The left clip broke and was free floating in my pelvic area. I was utterly stunned. I told her no and I had no idea I had clips. 
I ended up going back to my original OB office and asked for a new dr. When I met with said new dr, it was like a breath of fresh air. She listened to me, told me she didn‚Äôt think my periods were ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and it had everything to do with the filshie clips. We scheduled surgery and last August she removed the right clip and both of my tubes. Unfortunately, after 4 hours of being cut open, she was unable to find the left clip. So at this time I have a free floating clip in my body. 
I was gaslit by drs for 8 years and 22 days because I have a period. Ladies, YOU know your body and YOU know when something is wrong. DONT stop fighting for answers. 
I am open to any questions you may have. 
Thanks for reading my post!

Edit: meant to add, since the surgery, my periods are *completely* different.

12ckvp6,Healthyhooha,1680702306.0,"I've struggled with BV , yeast infections, utis and just sweaty smelly odor in my hooha area.  It's nothing to be ashamed about, we are women it happens to alot of us. But here are some things that have helped me deal / prevent the above. These things worked for me, everyone's bodies are different so I can't guarantee it'll work for your body. 

1) drink alot of water, atleast 8 cups a day. Your pee should be a light yellow, if it's clear then you're drinking too much water. 

2) take a daily probiotic, my doctor recommended me to take any probiotic with atleast a billion cultures in it. **warning ** when you start a new probiotic it can make you go #2 more frequently and sometimes diahhrea, this is normal and it will stop within 3 days to a week of taking the probiotics consistently. Always remember tip #7, wipe front to back. 

3) keep anything with high fragrance away from your hooha.. that includes perfumes, soaps, Douches,  deodorant and I also recommend washing your underwear with unscented or lightly scented detergent. 

4) always go pee before and after sex, even if it's just alittle trinkle... do it. 

5) go commando to bed

6) after you get out of the shower dry off really good (just pat dry your hooha area, don't swipe back and forth ) then lay in your bed on your back and spread eagle.. let your body, especially your hooha cool off and dry naturally.

7) always wipe from front to back, especially after a #2. & I don't recommend baby wipes or any type of alternative to toilet paper.. and steer clear of the scented tp as well. 

8) go to the doctor if your hooha is doing something out of the norm, listen to your body. 

9) make sure to take probiotics while on any antibiotics. 

10) consider changing your diet. If you have alot of sugar or salt intake, decrease it. You can start small and then see how your body reacts. Do this as recommended by your doctor. I am not a physician so I can only give recommendations. Please consult with your doctor before changing your diet if you are on meds for any health problems etc.

11) if you notice that you are getting bv, utis or yeast infections after sex, ask your partner what type of soap they are using.. If they are using any fragrance soap on their parts then ask them to change to a unscented soap.. this small change will make a huge difference for your hooha. 

12) don't insert anything into your hooha as a quick diy treatment. That includes the ""yogurt tampon"" , the boric acid suppository, etc. Trust me it will probably do more harm than good. But I do highly recommend staying away from the suppository because one of my friends tried the boric acid one and it literally burned her vaginal walls and it took her forever to recover.. double ouch. So please avoid. 

13) when mother nature has her monthly visit, stay away from scented tampons and pads, they are a big no no. I recommend getting organic tampons if possible and changing them more frequently if you have bv or a yeast infection while your time of the month. 

14) if you have bv, yeast infection or a uti. Stay away from alcoholic beverages. They have added sugars and will just make it worse, especially if you have a uti. If you must drink, please please please drink a glass of water in between each drink to counter act the sugar intake..trust me, you'll thank me later. 

15) stay away from sodas and diet sodas while having a yeast infection or uti. They have added sugars and salts that make shit worse. If you must drink soda, Try to limit yourself to 1 a day or buy the mini packs of soda and just drink 1 of those IF you must. But try to mostly drink water.

16) stay away from candy and any kind of processed sugar foods. Natural sugars from fruit are okay in moderation. Yeast thrives off of sugar so the less sugar you have in your body the better. 
**disclaimer** changing your diet to no sugar can cause your body to go into shock and can cause your blood sugar to plummet (it happened to me when I first changed my diet) so I recommend keeping some gum or something with small amounts of sugar near you just incase. Now again, consult your doctor before changing your diet drastically. Please consult your doctor! 

17) if you have a uti, don't hold your pee..even if just a little trinkle comes out just let it out. Holding your pee can make your uti worse. 

18) if you have a uti and can't get to a doctor within a day or so I recommend using AZO urinary products.. they help alot with the discomfort until you can get to the doctor. But don't use them as an escape from the doctor, please still see your doctor. 

19) if you are a smoker or if you vape, try to cut back. My doctor told me that vaping and smoking can cause more yeast infections.. I honestly don't know why, its worth a google search though. 

20) when shaving your hooha, try to keep any shaving creams or shaving oils only in your public hair area and rinse very very well after shaving as well. If you moisturize after shaving, I suggest getting a unscented moisturizer for your pubic hair area. 

21) AVOID THONGS . While you have a uti, yeast infection or bv thong underwear will and can make it worse. Please avoid thongs. I recommend cotton boy short underwear or going commando (as long as you aren't on your period). Trust me, just avoid the sexy underwear.

22) if you tend to sweat alot in your groin area, especially if you're at the gym, I suggest going into the bathroom, get a dry paper towel, wet it damp and pat your groin area with the damp paper towel (pat, don't swipe). Then take a dry paper towel and pat completely dry. Try to stay as dry as possible. Yeast and bv thrive in warm moist areas aka the groin so limiting the moisture can help tremendously! It's alot of work but trust me it works, I had to do this alot at the beginning but I felt alot better after I did it. 

23) limit sex while having a yeast infection,  bv or uti. I recommend no sex tbh. 


Hope some of these tips help you as much as they've helped me :)

The trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp. Both of these events are causing such a huge stir up of sexism and violent comments towards women and their experiences. It feels so defeating, and for the first time in my life I am truly starting to feel like a second-rate citizen as a woman. 

Our concerns aren't heard. Our stories not listened to. Our health is not a priority. 

It's disgusting to realize how much sexism lives behind closed doors, only for cultural events like these to bring them out in to the open again. I fear for our future. I fear for our autonomy, as it hangs in the balance. Something that self-righteous men have been saying for decades is ""safe.""

qkqkin,WomensHealth,1635808606.0,"I (23F) usually never dare to post stuff on reddit since I like to avoid confrontation. But this time, instead of trying to find a post that is similar to my thoughts, I decided that I'll write one. So here I gooo

As a teenager and then as a woman, I have been through shaving, plucking, waxing, bleaching, laser etc.
It caused me to have lots of ingrown hair, of itchy pimples, small cuts, burns and even infections. 

I have been judged and mocked when I had too much hair on my arms, for the brown hair on my belly or if I didn't shave my legs. I grew up with these standards and I have seen tons and tons of ads about all the imaginable ways of getting rid of women bodyhair.. 

In porn industry, they shave everything as well and it somewhat influence women and men in real life.
So like almost every women, I have worked almost everyday to maintain a hairless body. 
It was time and energy consuming. And very expensive.
I grew up in this society feeling uncomfortable with myself, feeling like I had to hide parts of myself to fit and to be loved.

I remember the first woman I have seen that wasn't shaving. She was not crazy or retarded. She was in fact extremely sane and very comfortable with her body. Using only natural and cruelty free products.
I was 18 at the time and the first time I saw her armpits I was DISGUSTED. Why tho? She was very clean. But even if I was also a woman, I didn't relate and I rejected her like everyone else. 

Now here I am at 23. I think I finally understood. 
You know that feeling when you know something had changed in you and you know there is no going back. That's how I felt today
I got out of the shower. And I shaved my legs and ladyparts for the first time in a month.
I am not against women that shaves if they like it or if they don't like too much hair. But I feel like everyone should be free to choose and be treated JUST THE SAME.
Cause they both have as much value and deserve to be and feel accepted.

So as I was saying, I got out of shower and I looked at myself naked in the mirror 
And I was like... Why does society want women to shave? Why does it matter? Just Why? That's not natural.
Body hair is what differentiate women from little girls. I was looking at my ladyparts and didn‚Äôt really feel like a woman, more like me when I was 10.
Take the lady parts by exemple, the biggest difference is actually the bodyhair. It's really beautiful and should be appreciated because that's how a woman is, that's how a woman naturally looks like.

And there is also a reason that we have body hair, especially on the ladyparts. 
Pubic hair is a sign of sexual maturity. It reduces friction during sexual intercourse, it helps stop bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body, it traps dirt and pathogens that may enter the body through the vagina.
So pubic hair is not unhygienic. It's normal and should be treated AS SUCH.

xe9sfi,Healthyhooha,1663181072.0,"As a teenager, I had no smell and never really any issues at all. But when I began having sex, I found that my vagina changed. I don‚Äôt know if it was my partner‚Äôs skin microbiome, his semen, or what, but I started having a slight smell when I went longer than 24 hours without a shower. And my discharge became thicker and whiter. 

This issue has persisted for years. I thought it was normal. Sometimes it would get worse; itchiness, a bad odor (I got tested for bacterial vaginosis and it came back negative), ‚Äúchunks‚Äù in my discharge (I am sorry for TMI). I was so embarrassed, especially when my boyfriend would wipe thick white discharge off his member or I could smell my vagina through my jeans. 

I put a boric acid suppository in my vagina last week after reading a thread on Reddit about it. I know it sounds dangerous, but I was tired. And some medical articles online did cite it as an ‚Äúalternative‚Äù treatment for yeast infections and BV. 

And my god. It freaking worked. 

My vagina has no smell. None. Even after a day without showering. My discharge is clear, thin, and slippery; I can‚Äôt remember the last time it was like that when I wasn‚Äôt ovulating. I feel good. Weirdest of all, I got horny. I didn‚Äôt realize, but my vagina has been ever-so-slightly sore for a long time, and the soreness went away. It‚Äôs crazy. My boyfriend also commented that my vagina has no smell, none at all, and he seemed pretty happy about that because he went down on me for a long time. 

I‚Äôm a biologist and I‚Äôm guessing it is because the natural pH of my vagina was restored. Vaginas are acidic and boric acid is‚Ä¶ an acid. Go figure.

o6hsxs,WomensHealth,1624469738.0,"I posted a couple months back about a lump in my breast that appeared cancerous in my breast, and I was hoping it wasn‚Äôt cancer. Well, it‚Äôs confirmed, it is cancer. I was diagnosed pretty quickly and have already had surgery (lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy). Chemo was originally not part of my treatment plan because we caught it early (before it went into the nodes) and it was small, but after genome testing, it was discovered that it‚Äôs a pretty aggressive cancer that‚Äôs a little more likely to come back so I‚Äôll be starting chemo soon, after a round of embryo freezing since my husband and I would like to try for a baby in the future (it‚Äôs very important to me, and overall, my prognosis is very good/low risk of coming back). 

I‚Äôm also posting this not to scare people, but for two reasons - 1) don‚Äôt put off getting lumps checked out. I went right away and we caught it early. Had I waited, the cancer was likely preparing to spread and my prognosis might not be as good/my treatment would have been more aggressive. And 2) the first few weeks after diagnosis was hard because I was terrified, but as I met with my doctors, I found out that many breast cancers are treatable or even curable. Armed with a treatment plan, I felt a lot better. So just know, if you‚Äôre going through this, it does get easier. And if you‚Äôre young like me, there are options for fertility preservation (there‚Äôs a shot you can get to help save your ovaries plus egg/embryo freezing). Not everyone needs chemo either, so there‚Äôs that too. 

My exact cancer is hormone positive (it responds to hormones) and her2 negative (a type of cancer that can be more aggressive). I‚Äôll have a short round of TC chemo - Taxol and Cytoxan followed by four weeks of radiation. I‚Äôll be on hormone blockers for 5-10 years but allowed to pause it in order to have a baby and the doctors believe it‚Äôs safe for me to do that. My oncologist says I‚Äôm still at low risk of recurrence and my risks of it coming back, after chemo, is less than 10%.

k5e1qb,WomensHealth,1606930905.0,"Hi, everyone. I am that girl who went from worrying about her ovary already being dead to finding out that she had ovarian cancer. I know its been a while, but I'm here with another update.

So...this one is more emotional than my previous ones. So much has happened, and it is insane...please let me know if this particular post doesn't belong on womenshealth, and I will quickly move it. I just...its becoming too much, and I feel like typing may help me process this...may as well give an update while I'm at it.

I got that second lung-draining I was mentioning in the last post, and holy cow was it awful...the appointment I thought would be an ultrasound to monitor it was actually the draining itself. Instead of it being done at the hospital this time, it was done at a nearby pulmonary clinic, so when my friend who went with me warned them that I was a screamer, they had no idea how serious it was. It wasn't pleasant; for me, or the doctor and nurses working on me.

I clung to my friend like a spider monkey throughout all of this as she literally had her arms around me to make sure I did not jolt, and my brain was in hyperdrive. At some point, the doctor stopped administering the numbing agent (after extra doses) and prodded the area gently, realizing that my fear also made the area hypersensitive to touch (I vaguely remember him asking my friend if she thought this was due to fear or pain, and my friend replied ""both"". By the time the catheter went in and the draining started, all the room was spinning and I was struggling to stay conscious; I found out from my friend that the nurses started worrying about whether or not I was going to vomit, and they all relaxed slightly when they realized I was just about to pass out. I...had never gotten to that point before. By the time it was finished, they had me rest until I could actually move safely and we surveyed the damage; I was dehydrated from sweating so much, and I kept apologizing to my friend for coating her in it as I tried to get some water in me. The doctor came in with a chuckle and said that he is pretty sure I scared off some patients. We all hope I never have to go in for another one. So that was my second-ever lung draining...fun.

These past couple of weeks, we have had my mother staying at my great aunt's and uncle's...her side. My great-aunt is completely and utterly senile and...senile or not, not a nice person. My great-uncle was at the point where he can't take care of her, but utterly refused care for her. So...for a while, my mother was their caretaker...it seemed to be working out fine.

We...we had Thanksgiving there, and she was fine. She seemed...better than I had ever seen her. She was so excited to see me, gave me so many hugs...I was worried the day would be incredibly awkward and uncomfortable but...it was a good day.

Two days later...she was gone...

After Thanksgiving she had been ill, but according to her and my great-uncle, it was just some nausea and vomiting. No fever, nothing that could have been led to this. We all figured she had a bit of food poisoning. Sunday, we noticed we hadn't gotten any texts from her, and she wasn't answering calls...odd, considering she was usually so, so quick to answer. Sunday afternoon my father and I checked in on her...it looked like she was asleep on her stomach, but she was cold...

We are reeling...we don't know what to think about this. Things were so complicated before this happened, so many mixed feelings due to so many events that just melted away. She was Mom. Now she is gone...and all myself, my father, and my siblings know is we would give anything to have her back. It hurts so bad...this hurts worse than anything the cancer has done to me.

jl6b2v,WomensHealth,1604095554.0,"I still can't get over how dehumanizing today's doctor's visit was....

I went to my doctor who I have been seeing since practically birth to get a blood test because I'm supposed to start Accutane soon. My doctor immediately turned hostile and started questioning why I would even consider such a dangerous medication. I told him I already discussed this with my dermatologist and had time to think this through (which I do not think it is dangerous, btw). He started asking me if I tried other solutions for my acne, which fine, but I wasn't coming in to discuss alternatives because I already made my mind up.

He then asked me if I take any other medication, to which I said the birth control pill. He once again was shocked and appalled. He told me that the pill is also dangerous and one day I am going to want children and will be infertile because of it. He said gynecologists give out the pill because it's a moneymaker, not because it's good for women's health. I was getting obviously frustrated because I was not here to talk about that. Really though, that wasn't the worst.

The worst came when he asked if I am sexually active. I hesitated but told him yes, and that was clearly my mistake believing that I could disclose that and not be judged. The first question he asked me was if I was married?! Or if I am planning on it soon? Err.. no and I am not? He then proceeded to ask if I have single or multiple partners, which that should be a fine question to ask a patient, but I knew he was prying to keep judging. I told him I'm in a stable relationship. He then goes on to give me a long lecture about how I should not be having premarital sex. I AM 22. At this point, I burst into tears because I felt humiliated and powerless to do or say anything. He continues lecturing me saying that if my boyfriend truly loves me, then he would not sleep with me. He also talked about divorce rates and that me sleeping with my boyfriend is jeopardizing our chance at a stable marriage in the future. He then begs me to rethink my stance on sex and to not do it anymore until I am married. I was biting my lip the entire time because I was ready to explode and walk out of there. I started lying to questions, such as if I slept with multiple people throughout my lifetime and how many years I've been having sex because I felt so ashamed. I no longer could be honest with him. 

The next worst part is I need to see him to pick up my results from the blood test next week and I am terrified of what he is going to ask me. I can't really change my doctor because my family goes to him and likes his ""traditional and honest"" approach to medicine. I can't tell my parents either because I come from a culture where this topic is forbidden, and my parents would side with him. Okay, fine, I can take it from my parents, but I shouldn't have to feel this way with my doctor. I still feel so disgusted and degraded. I don't know how to process all of this. No woman should EVER have to go through this because let's be real, this conversation would have never occurred with a male patient. 

TLDR: Went in for a blood test. Instead got shamed for choosing to take Accutane, birth control pill, and ESPECIALLY for having premarital sex. Felt embarrassed, ashamed, humiliated, degraded, etc. and still do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jl6b2v/today_i_had_the_worst_and_most_humiliating/,Today I had the worst and most humiliating doctor's visit of my life,,166,35,0.97,lawschoolkat

I‚Äôve seen a lot of people recently talking about issues that could be related to a tight/ weak pelvic floor. Trouble peeing after sex, uncomfortably tight vag, pain during sex
Pain is NEVER NORMAL. 

Also most of us sit all day and have weak, elongated butt and back muscles. This will give you poor posture and put pressure on your pelvic floor which is a recipe for all sorts of issues. 

If you ever give birth it will make the process and recovery much harder. You might experience back pain. You might have cramps around your vulva and be unable to relax your perineum in order to have sex painlessly. People can get prolapse as they age. 

If your lower back has a deep curve to it, you‚Äôre putting a ton of pressure on your vagina. If you slouch while sitting or sit on your tailbone, you are doing damage. 

For your own sake do squats. Do some light lifting. Walk. Get your back and butt strong. Get used to sitting and standing tall.

 What discs do you lovey people recommend?

So I‚Äôm getting married in less than a month (27 days to go!!!!!! Yay!!!!!!!) and of course My period tracker is predicting me to either start my period on my wedding day or the day after. 
 ( sobbing when I think about it. I saved myself for marriage and my first experiences will be while cramping and bleeding!?!? It‚Äôs so disheartening )( ugh So if anyone knows of a way to make this coming cycle about 5 days shorter without using hormonal birth control or any other kind of hormonal medicine I would totally jump on that.(( I‚Äôm not comfortable using anything hormonal we will be using barriers and fertility awareness for birth control )) I‚Äôm also due to start today by the way) 


I‚Äôve never had to worry about sex before let alone sex during the cramping and bleeding stage. So this is all completely foreign to me. 


I‚Äôve seen commercials for disks that are good for sex during the actively bleeding faze and before I just buy whatever I can find on Amazon for a decent price with good reviews. I wanted to get some feedback from others who would have experience with them. I‚Äôm also aware the Amazon sellers buy fake reviews so I can‚Äôt count on them all being truthful. 

I‚Äôm 35 years old and started with a diva size 1 over 10 years ago and instantly loved it. I lost my diva cup after a few years and bought a menstro soft cup which I have been using for 6 years now and it‚Äôs still going strong ( I can‚Äôt find them on Amazon anymore sadly, or I would link it for you since I think it‚Äôs a great cup )  I also bought and tried the pixie cup size 2 a few years ago but found it to be uncomfortable, so I went back to the smaller menstro cup. I guess turning 30 didn‚Äôt magically make me need a bigger size lol. 

My questions are:

How is sizing a disk different than a cup? 


What should I look for when reading reviews on specific ones?

Since I like a soft cup should I look for a soft disc? 

What discs do your partners like best? 



 [this listing has 2 sizes included](CareCup Menstrual Disc - Set of 2 Reusable Period Discs - Premium Design with Soft, Flexible, Medical-Grade Silicone + 1 Storage Bag (1 Small + 1 Large) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096PZZNGR/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_FJ35AKF3STXCT3GZ4MHN) 

So would that be good to get for the wedding night/honeymoon? That way if one doesn‚Äôt work I can try the other size without the waiting for a new purchase to arrive?  It‚Äôs listed as soft and while that seems to be a negative for some reviewers others prefer it. It only has 8 reviews but they look authentic and are overall positive. 


Or should I go for [this one](MOONTHLIES Menstrual Disc - Reusable Period Disc - Starter Set of 2 Sizes - Tampon, Pad and Cup Alternative https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XQZJZNM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_Q22M864093RZSN51164R) ? 

Since it has more reviews and also gives you 2 sizes? It‚Äôs over twice the cost than the other listing and described as firmer  I also think it costs so much more because it seems to have more engineering put into it. So that might be a better option. 

I‚Äôm just so indecisive since I‚Äôve loved my cups for so long and I don‚Äôt know the first thing about what to look for in a disc. 

Maybe I can buy both and try the cheaper ones first?  

Keeping the others as backup if they don‚Äôt work out. So that way I don‚Äôt have to worry about waiting for an order to come and missing out on really enjoying my honeymoon. If the cheaper one do work great I can return the more expensive unopened. 

Or should I look for ones that are specifically advertised as great for sex? Is there anything that would make one better during sex than another? 


I‚Äôm a bit worried about it grossing out my new husband ( he is also a virgin, but we have openly discussed my cycle as a whole and that I‚Äôm probably going to be bleeding on the wedding night or on the honeymoon. So don‚Äôt worry he isn‚Äôt going in blind.  He has been very understanding and would never say anything if he was put off by period blood.

The reason I'm wondering if this is what triggered it is because the only time in my life that my period was mostly regular other than when I was on birth control was when I was sexually active. Once I stopped having sex, my period pretty much disappeared again until I got back on bc (which I stopped taking not long after). Does anyone have any info or related stories on this?

g2i41w,WomensHealth,1587054234.0,"I've seen so many posts in r/womenshealth the last few weeks about people stressing over ""missed"" periods and wondering if they're pregnant (even if they haven't had sex in months!) so I thought it would be worth just making a Public Service Announcement.  


**Our bodies can be highly sensitive to stress.**  


If your body has reason to think that the outside world is stressful or uncertain at the moment, it is likely to DELAY ovulation this month.  That means that if you are more stressed than normal (global pandemic, anyone) or if you have changed your sleeping habits (sleeping more or less, sleeping with the tv on etc. etc.), of your eating habits, or your exercise habits etc. etc. etc-----then it is HIGHLY likely that you're going to see a change in your normal menstrual cycle.   


Basically, your body may decide to hold off on releasing an egg until either things return to normal or your ""new normal"" becomes more routine.  That can mean that your ovulation gets pushed back by days or weeks---and when ovulation is delayed, your period will be equally delayed.   


So let's say you have a 28 day cycle:  if you normally ovulate on Day 14 and don't ovulate until Day 20....your period ain't going to show up on Day 28 that month. Instead, it'll be arriving around Day 34.  The time between your period starting and ovulation is HIGHLY variable, but the time between ovulation and menstruation is very CONSISTENT.  If there is any change to your cycle, it will almost definitely happen BEFORE ovulation.   


That means that there's very little you can do to ""induce"" a period, apart from trying to be as zen as possible to lull your body into ovulation and starting the whole process that leads to your period.    


In short: don't be too worried if your period is late this month. And if you want some extra reassurance, look into ways you can keep track of ovulation because that will be the best way to determine if you are truly ""late"" for your period (14+ days after ovulation) or if you are simply experiencing delayed ovulation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/g2i41w/psa_expect_delayed_periods_during_the_pandemic/,PSA: Expect Delayed Periods During the Pandemic,,166,22,1.0,Pleasant-Present
18ldnmk,Healthyhooha,1702919035.0,"I was sexually abused as a toddler and the pain experienced from that means I can‚Äôt touch my clit directly without associating it with what happened. 
My clit hood is also pretty small, and doesn‚Äôt pull back all the way over my clit. 

This means that I get pearls of smegma built up under my clit hood that I need to wash away. Sometimes I can do it fine by running water over my clit once I‚Äôve pulled back the hood as far as it will go. But sometimes I need to use a finger to brush away discharge / smegma build up under the hood, or gently pull the hood back and forth to get the smegma out. 

This means touching my clit directly, and when I do that, I end up passing out because of my trauma.

If I don‚Äôt touch my clit to remove build up, the smegma builds up and it gets really painful and uncomfortable.

so i‚Äôve been dealing with (what i thought) was a yeast infection for about 7 months now. 7 months, 5 doctors, 9 appointments later still no relief. I posted about it last week and a lot of people recommended doing a full fungal/bacterial culture to figure out what was really going on, since it hasn‚Äôt responded to fluconozole or other antifungals. I had a gyn appointment today so I called last week to make sure that they would be able to do these tests and emphasized that I‚Äôd be leaving for a month the week after the appointment so really needed to take these tests at that appointment. I was assured that I could have ‚Äúany test I wanted‚Äù done at the appointment. Fast forward to today and the gyn is about to do the same swab for 2 strains of yeast, BV, and trichomonis that I‚Äôd already taken and gotten negative results from (edit: surprise surprise, it came back negative again‚ò∫Ô∏è). When I asked about the full fungal/bacterial cultures she told me that they DIDN‚ÄôT HAVE THE RIGHT TUBES TO RUN THESE TESTS. I told her that I‚Äôd called a week earlier just to make sure that I would be able to do full cultures and she just shrugged. I also asked about cytolytic vaginosis (i‚Äôve noticed the itching isn‚Äôt quite as bad on my period) and she said she‚Äôd never heard of it and that it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to have too much of the good bacteria. At this point I‚Äôm just so frustrated and wondering if this is grounds to file a complaint? I just feel like I was dragged out to this obgyn and made to pay a $60 copay (I just graduated and haven‚Äôt been able to get a job yet so I don‚Äôt even have any incomeüò≠) just to not get the testing I was promised and to have legitimate concerns dismissedü´†

v997xz,Healthyhooha,1654871926.0,"I wanted to share my recent experiences about two pelvic procedures I had and why one was traumatic and why one couldn‚Äôt have possibly gone better. Both doctors knew about my SA history and it was discussed before both procedures began.


The first one was an egg retrieval for IVF. This one had me start in a different little room where a nurse failed to get an IV in my hand, so the anesthesiologist was called in early to place my IV. He was very unsympathetic and clinical. My doctor asked me what they needed to do for me in the room when I reminded her about my past and I told her I wanted to know the role of everyone in the room and have a female nurse by my side while being put under. I *really* didn‚Äôt think I needed to specify to not expose my vagina to the entire room.   


Once I was taken into the room they had me lay on a small half-sized exam table that had the big industrial leg stirrups like you find for L&D. The nurse had me open the back of my gown at this point and didn‚Äôt help me not show my bare ass to the open door behind me. So I was already uncomfortable but just tried quickly to settle on the table. I was handed a paper sheet to cover myself. Now lots of other people entered and were talking around me but not to me. The anesthesiologist began to prep his meds. The nurse had me put my legs in the stirrups and got me spread as far as I could without it hurting and then she *threw up my sheet*. I began crying and tried to cover my vagina and she wouldn‚Äôt help me! I couldn‚Äôt get the sheet back over myself and was now having an anxiety attack so I couldn‚Äôt speak and just desperately trying to cover myself with my hand. Then the anesthesiologist administered the burning propofol while I was still desperately trying to not expose myself. It was horrible and very traumatic. I cried myself to sleep that night and had flashbacks every time I showered for a week. Just awful.   


My other procedure was yesterday. This was a surgery to remove excess scar tissue from my birth tear that was causing lots of pain. We had already tried every type of medication, cream, lidocaine jelly, and pelvic PT for two years before this. This time we did everything in the procedure room. They had me undress only from the waist down and gave me a fleece blanket to cover with. I felt so much more comfortable still being in my bra/shirt and having the thicker blanket instead of a paper sheet. Instead of a little half table I sat on a chair that had a leg rest come out from under me. They reclined me a bit and then the anesthesiologist came in. He gave me a lidocaine shot first! He said he understood hand IVs could be painful and the propofol medication burns so he likes to make his patients comfortable. Best anesthesiologist ever! He also made lots of jokes with me. Once I was numb he gave me the IV. They introduced everyone‚Äôs name and role to me. And I was put out just in that reclined position. They didn‚Äôt uncover me or put me in stirrups until *after* I was unconscious! This all was literally the best case scenario possible I could imagine. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. *That* is how you handle an anxious SA survivor for a pelvic procedure! Don‚Äôt traumatically expose and ignore.

I‚Äôve heard anal shouldn‚Äôt cause pain or issues like this so it must be because I wasn‚Äôt prepared and he‚Äôs thicker too. Overall I feel violated but has anyone else felt loose like this or developed a lump after anal?

Imagine my surprised pleasure when that is one of the key factors to this device. You play the games by tightening and relaxing. It measures both and you score by being able to do both.

Last year, I created a teen-led nonprofit called FreetheFlow. FreetheFlow‚Äôs initiative is to end period poverty by providing feminine hygiene products to menstruators in need across the country. Working with my school and community, FreetheFlow has raised over $700 dollars in monetary donations and has collected over 3,000 feminine hygiene products (pads, tampons, etc).¬†

Although overlooked, the inability to access and afford pads and tampons is one of the biggest problems for low-income and homeless menstruators. In the United States, 1 in 5 teens struggles to afford feminine hygiene products, resulting in school absences and the use of less-hygienic materials. And, when homeless menstruators cannot afford products, they often turn to the use of any cloth material they can find; this puts them at risk of different infections.¬†

Right now, during COVID-19, the need for feminine hygiene products has increased as periods do not stop for pandemics.¬†

It's like my body rejects any foreign bacteria it comes in contact with. At this point I feel gross and the idea of sex scares me as I know there are always consequences for short term pleasure. And constant doctors visits have become expensive and embarrassing. I struggle to enjoy myself knowing what I'm doing long term to my body. Most of the time I don't feel it is even worth engaging in.

**EDIT: Because I‚Äôm getting down voted to hell‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm fully aware of the importance of antibiotics when warranted. Perhaps I worded my question wrong but I am not debating the need of the antibiotic if that is what the provider prescribes‚Äî having been a mother for 10 years, this is the first UTI we‚Äôve had to deal with and it has been distressing to all. She was embarrassed to tell me because she thought she was peeing and would need diapers like her baby brother. I am questioning the diagnosis because it is not presenting like a UTI - but bacterium is present and understand the need for appropriate treatment. Shit, y‚Äôall made me feel like a terrible mother for simply seeking some moral support that this is normal - a little bit of compassion would have gone a long way. I myself have been subject to over prescribed antibiotics which have caused me long term grief.

**UPDATE** : **MOTHERS INTUITION!!** My daughter did NOT in fact have a UTI and we‚Äôve been treating her with the prescribed antibiotic (Bactrim) for the past 3 days - for a UTI she did not have.

The cultures came back positive for bacterial vaginosis (no yeast detected) and have been prescribed a 10-day course of Flagyl (I have no experience with this antibiotic and was not aware it had to be compounded). THIS is why I came here to ask about her symptoms because she had no pain and lots of discharge- it was her vagina attempting to clean itself.

The nurse practitioner I saw started off saying she has never told her patients in 20 years to examine their clitoris which was a huge red flag for me. Then she proceeded to say she couldn't see anything, and I told her she actually had to retract the hood like I stated. She still said she couldn't see anything and gave me a mirror so I showed her the keratin pearls that are under the skin which I was not able to free myself. After poking around with a dry qtip she then said since I have pain due to increased blood flow there when I get aroused I should use topical lidocaine and not ""prod"" myself down there. She also said to take a baking soda bath to ""even things out"" which sounds like a horrible idea to me? I have gotten yeast infections from lush bath bombs in the past which contain baking soda. The next thing she prescribed was topical estrogen cream but I have a blood clotting disorder and the website says not to use it if you have that, but she said ""it doesn't work the same way"" and I'll be fine.

k05ufw,WomensHealth,1606227702.0,"Long-time user of Fertility Awareness over here just wanting to give you all a friendly reminder that the next month or so is NOTORIOUS for causing late periods due to all of the ""stress"" (even if it's happy stress) of the holidays and family gatherings.  Especially this year with the added stress of Covid and navigating having to turn down family functions, it is quite likely that you or someone you know will end up with an extra long menstrual cycle in the next few weeks.   


So, before you freak out that you might be pregnant, here's the science:

* Your period starts due to a decrease in the hormone **progesterone** that occurs 11-14 days after ovulation.
* Your period is not on a ""clock"" and doesn't know that it's been 28 or however many days since your last period.  All it knows is that it starts when progesterone levels fall off---whether that's on day 28 or day 55. 
* If your body is under stress, it will sometimes push back ovulation day later and later until things calm down enough.  Stress can = changed sleeping patterns, changed eating habits, working out more, working out less, being anxious about something, being overly busy, traveling, etc. etc. 
* As I said before, your period will NOT start until \~11-14 days AFTER ovulation. So if your body pushes ovulation back, it's gonna push your period back too.

So, if you aren't tracking ovulation (so you don't know if it's 11-14 days after), I wouldn't freak out if your period ends up a bit late this month or next month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/k05ufw/psa_tis_the_season_for_late_periods/,PSA: Tis the Season for Late Periods,,160,27,0.99,Pleasant-Present

ixti0v,TwoXSupport,1600800203.0,"Picture this. You're in bed with a man. He finishes, settles down onto his pillow, and then, almost as an afterthought, asks: ""Did you...y'know...? 

The man cannot bring himself to say ""come"" or ""orgasm"" or ""climax."" Perhaps he doesn't even know what it looks like for a woman to do those things, based on this pathetic after-thought of a question that he asks so lazily, so hesitantly, so as to carefully imply that even if you were to say ""No,"" there's nothing that could possibly be done about it.  The man has come, so the sex is done.   


I can't be the only one who has experienced this time and time again. I'm very happy with my current partner, who makes sure that we both get off. He might make me come 3 times before he does. But I feel like a man who prioritizes women's pleasure is so goddamn rare, and it makes me really sad. I'm bisexual, and the difference between sex with men and women is so different. With women, you might make each other come for hours until you're both too tired & satisfied to continue. With a dude, he comes, the 15 minute sex is apparently over, & you're left horny and frustrated as hell.   


I guess my advice is: You deserve so much better than that! Never settle for a man who doesn't prioritize your pleasure at least as much as his own. Sex is for everyone, and pleasure is for everyone. And if your current dude thinks sex is over after he comes even if you're close yourself, teach him that that's not how things should work. You wouldn't stop the sex if the orgasms were the other way around. You can keep going, in other and more creative ways. You both deserve pleasure.

I have never posted anything on reddit despite lurking and reading on this subreddit for years, but i finally rid myself from this horrid infection and i had to hop on and share in case this works for anyone else. So, a little backstory, I (25F) have been struggling with chronic BV since i was 17, gardnerella vaginalis to be specific! For the first 2 years my doctor kept prescribing me antibiotics, which honestly never worked, caused yeast infections, and ruined my entire immune system. After being fed up with this around my early 20s, I decided to quit antibiotics and try a natural remedy route. At this point, tests were showing that gardnerella spread to even my cervix, which doctors said there was nothing more modern meds could for me anyway. 

 Ive been to every doctor, tried every supplement imaginable. Boric acid, baking soda, pre&probiotics garlic, yogurt, apple cider vinegar, wild oregano oil, lactic acid gel, douching after sex w peroxide, even suppositories made up of only lactobacili and nothing fucking worked!!!! I was so exhausted i just gave up, used boric acid before and after my period for 5 days each month to get rid of the horrid smell, and id been doing that since i was 22. Until 2 weeks ago. I had a pretty bad bv flare up after being sick w the flu that was making me so frustrated as i wanted to see my bf, but as you can imagine there was no way i was letting him get close to me while i smelled like rotten fish juice. I went on this subreddit once again, desperately looking for ANY new advice as id try anything. And i found a comment under a post saying this girl got cured in 3 days after years of bv by taking maca root powder! So, i immediately went to a pharmacy and picked some 3000mg maca root powder capsules by the brand Superfoods, and quit my usual routine w boric acid to see if it will work. Oh. My. God. In just 5 days everything was gone. Legit! AND ITS STAYED GONE! EVEN AFTER MY PERIOD! 

HOLY SHIT YOU GUYS GO BUY MACA ROOT POWDER, GIVE IT A TRY! Idk if this will work for everyone, and i did extensive research to find any link for maca root treating bv, found none. Even used my moms health officals  only site (membership requires a health worker license) to try to find anything but literally no doctor gave maca root for anything except libido and fertility. Idk how this works at all but i decided to post here since it may help women get rid of this awful infection and maybe spread awareness for maca root being used more as a supplement for this! If you do try please report back, im super curious to see if this will help women suffering as i did!

I agree that periods should be normalized because none of us should have to deal with being shamed for something we can't control. 

But as I was handwashing my bloody underwear today morning, I couldn't help but think ""what the actual fuck am I doing?""

If I was bleeding out of my ass I would be so concerned. If I was bleeding out of my nose I'd be concerned. If I was bleeding out of literally *any orifice* other than my vagina, I'd be concerned. But when I wake up and see a giant blood clot in my underwear I'm totally okay with it and just get right to business. 

In my opinion we should all just protest against periods and make a big hoot and cancel them once and for all in order to ensure that future generations don't have to suffer, and i don't care if it's medically impossible. 

I feel so violated and I'm not even joking. It's not even funny. Like I *know* that it's inevitable and a normal bodily function and all that but I didn't ask for this shit. Idk I'm just raging right now.

13im9wu,Healthyhooha,1684188616.0,"Hi All. Long time lurker, first time posting in this sub. 

When I (23F) was 15, I had a shitty boyfriend who wanted to fist me. I was a virgin and really didn‚Äôt know much about anything, so I said yes. I thought it was a normal request because I didn‚Äôt know any better.

So, he did. A few minutes in, we realized that the couch cushion we were sitting on was covered in blood. I stood up and blood was just POURING out of me. I freaked out, didn‚Äôt want my parents to find out, so we hurriedly cleaned everything up and I put a pad on while I continued to bleed. The next day, I was still bleeding and passed out at one point.

I didn‚Äôt want my parents to know, so I never said anything. but a few days later I noticed that my labia minora had been torn and was hanging almost completely off. 

I never went to the doctor for it, I‚Äôve still never seen a gynecologist, and my labia never healed. It‚Äôs still torn and hanging loose after almost 9 years. 

It usually doesn‚Äôt bother me during sex, but does get irritated occasionally during sex. Sometimes I won‚Äôt think about it for weeks and other times it really hurts. It‚Äôs embarrassing too as I think it looks ugly.

The boyfriend I had at 15 was an insecure jerk and had abusive tendencies. Getting away from him was the best thing I‚Äôve ever done for myself. It hurts me to feel like I let him permanently disfigure me. 

So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is‚Ä¶ is this a common injury to get from sex and I‚Äôm just being dramatic? Can it be fixed after all this time? Is there anything I can take or put on it to ease the occasional pain? I‚Äôve never talked to anyone about this and just wanted to get it off my chest and get advice.

lje5ou,Healthyhooha,1613265865.0,"Ladies, I am in shock.

In a nutshell, I got my first ever Yeast Infection (YI) back in November and have been battling reoccurring ones since then. I read Boric Acid helps fight both YI and Bacterial Vaginosis (BV) and, though I'm lucky to say (knock on wood) I haven't experienced BV, I decided to try the boric acid for 21 days.

FYI, I've used all the OTC creams and prescription creams available - YI always returns. I'm on a strict candida diet and have been eating a bunch of probiotics (refrigerated ones including RenewLife and Dr. Formulated) and anti-fungals (oregano oil, garlic, caprylic acid). Boric acid was my ""last resort"".

The boric acid was irritating at first, but eventually the irritation went away and so did the YI (I think), though I'd get random pings of itchiness here and here. That said, **I found my infection would come back days after I stopped using the boric acid.**

I'm from Canada, so our boric acid brands are limited, I bought the [NutraBlast Boric Life brand](https://www.amazon.ca/NutraBlast-Boric-Acid-Vaginal-Suppositories/dp/B07212DK9F/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3LH1FR4Y5OD79&dchild=1&keywords=boric+acid&qid=1613262772&sprefix=boric+a%2Caps%2C177&sr=8-5) because of their awesome reviews, this was the boric acid I used for 21 days before the YI would return.

So I thought it may be the brand, I then bought a different brand called Intimae, I'm shocked to see the **boric acid powder is** **different** than that of that of NutraBlast's.

I've attached pics, you can see how NutraBlast's is ""chunkier"" than that of Intimae. **More importantly** the capsule of NutraBlast has **glitter** in it that's released after it's melted - WTF?! When I read the 1 star Amazon reviews, lots of women stated it's not real boric acid, now I'm beginning to think the same thing.

I've yet to give Intimae a try, though I seriously wonder if the chunkiness and whatever glitter of NutraBlast's boric acid was causing my irritation and not getting rid of the YI.

Has anyone else had these problems with boric acid? Do you use NutraBlast's Boric Life?

Also, reading through, I've realized this sounds like some type of ad for Intimae - it's not, I seriously just want to put this post out there because I worry about the ingredients I was putting in my vagina for so long.

You know I keep it squeaky, yeah (You know I keep it squeaky)‚Äù

I'm not adding to the landfills like I used to (won't be doing that for the next 30 years at the least), I do not have to feel uncomfortable in the groin wearing a pad next to my already sensitive and dry skin, and best of all, I save so much money!

It took me a few attempts to figure out how to use a mentrual cup and what fold to use to ensure that the cup opens properly, etc. I missed half an hour of college lecture doing that today. But dude, was it worth it!! I don't have to worry about leaks or stains and need not empty the cup for another 4 hours. One of the reasons I'd get irritated before this was that uncomfortable feeling wearing a pad and the anticipation of it. Since that is taken care of now, the only things that remain are practice pulling the cup out and dealing with the PMDD. 

It's a pity though, that I took so long to make the switch. I'm 21, have menstruated for 10 years and have known about this product for over 5 years now. I wish I'd done this earlier.

It‚Äôs been a very long time since having one and I have been very sick the last week not realizing my iron levels were tanked. I thought I was having mini strokes and was going to go to the hospital next week on Monday. I‚Äôve been damn near passing out/can‚Äôt see or stand at all when the episodes hit. I called my boyfriend of three years to explain that I am probably fine and that I got my period. I started to tell him about the iron levels being depleted from the blood and he shut me down immediately and said he doesn‚Äôt want to listen to any of that.

Now this is the issue: 
I freaked out and said we were never having children if he couldn‚Äôt handle talking to me about my literal well being as is related to my period, as I wasn‚Äôt even talking about the blood itself, just what was happening to me with the iron. He still couldn‚Äôt stomach it.

He got very mad that I said that about having his children and I feel like I can‚Äôt help him because I honestly believe what I said. Birth is very messy and I need serious support during and after birth and if this bothers him than idk what to tell him. I agree it‚Äôs gross but I can‚Äôt help it? It‚Äôs not my fault. I needed support yesterday too but thankfully I have a slew of really good friends who brought me iron pills and good food and stayed with me. This morning, I finally feel better!!

Hello, Hooha friends.

As we're sure many of you know by now, Roe v Wade was effectively overturned by the Supreme Court yesterday, returning regulation of abortions to the states.

Disclaimer: This is a specific US issue, and we acknowledge not everyone is from the US here.

This most definitely affects many of us here that are capable of becoming pregnant, and we wanted to show some solidarity and offer some credible resources and other subreddits that could offer guidance and assistance for those of us who find ourselves in need of abortion services. In the event you find yourself in need of hospital care after a home abortion, you do NOT have to tell them so. There is no reliable test to detect abortion medications in your bloodstream, and there's no medical way to distinguish a home abortion from a spontaneous miscarriage.

It's worth mentioning that we should all be cautious of the rhetoric we engage in here. Much of the discourse that draws parallels between, for example, The Handmaid's Tale and yesterday's ruling ignores the fact that BIPOC people have suffered from these injustices a lot longer than white women have. We strongly suggest that your social media feeds are diverse and include BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalized/disenfranchised folks, as they are often the most impacted and have important views to consider as we navigate our way through this mess. It's also worth remembering that it isn't just men in power making these decisions - there is a large demographic of women who bear responsibility for this outcome as well.

Be safe. If you live in a state with trigger bans and/or states with strict regulations, consider long-acting reversible contraception, stocking up on condoms, ""reasonable"" stocking up on birth control pills or Plan B (reasonable meaning leave some for others), tubal ligations or vasectomies.

Vote in local and state elections to make your voice heard on those levels.

Please do NOT share folk or herbal ""remedies"" to induce abortion.

In solidarity,

About 4/5 months ago I started bleeding and tearing during sex. Nothing about our sex life changed, not the positions, the intensity, the lube, anything.

The tear seems to be right at the entrance to the vagina - almost like an excess piece of skin and it tears upon insertion every time. It bleeds a little bit but not much. It hurts once the penis is inserted but much less, like a deep ache kind of pain. But the pain at the tear is sharp and bad. 

I am super turned on, I actively want to have sex with my partner, I am consenting, never coerced and he never makes me feel bad for stopping sex because of the pain. 

I have seen my doctor many times and there‚Äôs no infection but inserting the speculum was so painful I cried - this has never happened before.

My doctor just prescribed some lube but it‚Äôs made no difference. She also suggested emptying my bladder and having a bath to relax before sex - doesn‚Äôt make a difference.

I now can‚Äôt have penetrative sex anymore and I want to. I am definitely turned on, my partner makes me orgasm 3 times before we try and thing penetrative but I am just in too much pain to do it.

Hi everyone! After 30 years of having a problem free vagina, I recently had my first two encounters with thrush. 

I ended up going down the rabbit hole of treatment, and found boric acid which worked so much better than I could have hoped. 

I have seen it popping up in this subreddit, and others, that people believe/are worried that boric acid will wipe out the bad AND good bacteria. 

Out of professional curiosity as a lab assistant in cytology, and after many hours of reading and talking to some amazing people who have done far more extensive research into the topic, I‚Äôve decided to run a little experiment to really see how boric acid affects lactobacilli. 

I took my first sample today, which is what has prompted my enthusiasm for the experiment, and was delighted to find a perfectly healthy looking flora with plenty of lactobacilli, no visible fungal spores, or other alarming bacteria (as confirmed by three cytologists). 

I‚Äôll attach a photo in the comments of all the little bacteria hanging out with the squamous cells on the slide. 

The further study I‚Äôm going to conduct will involve me and one of my friends (so far, hoping I can rope in more people!) and will involve the following samples:

- before boric acid use (at least one month without use)
- after 1 day, 2 days, and 3 days
- 1 day, 3 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks (maybe a month) after last use without any probiotic use. 

I‚Äôm very excited to be able to contribute in some small way to such a fascinating topic, and hope I‚Äôll be able to bring some peace of mind to people suffering from recurrent thrush and BV that they won‚Äôt destroy their microbiome by using boric acid.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1437cql/effect_of_boric_acid_on_lactobacillus/,Effect of boric acid on lactobacillus,,153,68,1.0,KathleenMayC

a4wcfu,Healthyhooha,1544453954.0,"I wanted to provide an update to [the post from two weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9ztsix/i_just_pulled_a_condom_out_of_my_vagina_it_was_in/?st=JPIFER9Y&sh=e18d0904) where I was freaking out about having found a condom stuck inside of my vagina. I received a lot of a good advice and reassurance which did help put my mind at ease. 

There were two main things I was worried about: damage to my vagina and pregnancy. 

Regarding damage to my vagina: I was told to look out for signs and symptoms of BV, a yeast infection, or general irritation. I have very much been in tune with my hooha and haven‚Äôt noticed any changes. So thank you for the tips there. 

Regarding pregnancy: I had been worried that the first condom stuck inside of me potentially damaged the second condom. I was also reminded of precum. Somebody suggested I get Plan B. I talked to my boyfriend at the first opportunity (who was amazingly supportive and kind and not at all freaked out) and asked him if he had cum the night before. (I honestly didn‚Äôt remember because I was a little bit sloshed.) He said he hadn‚Äôt. I told him then and there that I had been contemplating the morning after pill, but that I was now opting not to get it because he didn‚Äôt come and I was right on the cusp of efficacy. (I fluctuate between 165 and 170lbs.) He was fine with my choices. 

My update comes to you today because I got my period! My painful, cramping, gassy, makes me feel like a demon period. Aunt Flo actually came into town about 3-4 days early, so I didn‚Äôt even have time to panic. 

This experience has inspired two changes in my life: Less sloppy, drunk sex (ergo less drinking in general) and lose some weight. I‚Äôve cut back on the IPAs, upped my intake in salads, and started kickboxing.

Thank you, r/Healthyhooha for the advice, reassurance, and support! You all definitely put my mind at ease.

kifnja,TwoXSupport,1608676009.0,"Hello everyone,

The mod team has decided to address the potential issues of a subreddit called FemaleDatingStrategy,  bleeding over into TwoXSupport. FDS is a subreddit who's goal, on the surface is about women getting the upper hand while dating men. While some of the posts there are on par with the values with TXS, there are some very sharp contrasts between us.

FDS believes marriage is a must in a relationship and speaks ill of women who do not wish to marry. Gender stereotypes are seemingly supported against men (Men MUST be the primary source of finances but women must not be the primary care givers to give a small example). This type of rhetoric is ultimately unhealthy. We certainly have our issues with men, hence the need for a subreddit like ours but we do not support gender stereotyping even when it's ""in our favour"". FDS has also gone so far as to take a negative of view of women who love their partners regardless of having flaws.

FDS is against sex work and workers on a fundamental level. While much of their reasoning seems based in logic and at times is aimed toward the NEED for sex work it ultimately detracts from supporting the women in it regardless of their circumstances and can be hostile toward those women.

I have yet to independently verify reports of rape victim brigading/bashing/blaming or transphobia though I have seen many comments against other cis women that lead me to believe the above is not only believable but likely. Other mods have however stated they have seen victim blaming for themselves and transphobia is alluded to in r/AgainstHateSubreddits due to mod overlap.

So while TXS is a women's subreddit, and can have the odd ""I hate men"" vent post, FDS takes this sentiment to a level that I would need an entirely separate post to adequately explain. TXS is about women being the best they can be, not the best they SHOULD be. An ideal to push yourself beyond your own imagined or imposed limitations in itself is not unhealthy but needs to be done with consideration that not all are capable or even willing to do so, and those who fit those descriptors should not be shunned.

In closing, we have decided to disallow promotion of FemaleDatingStrategy in posts or comments in TwoXSupport. Any posts or comments promoting FDS will be removed and continued breach of this policy will warrant further action upon review.

Thank you!

ikmyas,TwoXSupport,1598976026.0,"Today and yesterday, there have been two posts in both of these subs condemning violence against women, only to have a flood of men commenting and explaining why this is actually a non-issue.

I'm really, really sick of seeing this on reddit, and sometimes it makes me want to give up on the platform entirely. I don't know how you can deny all of the facts and statistics that point to the fact that we have an epidemic of male violence in the US and globally. Every time a shooter makes it onto the news, I never see male violence brought up as a framework through which to discuss it. [Of 93 shooters in 2014, 97 percent were male.](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/02/male-violence-is-everywhere/554261/) In the face of the BLM protests, I think about how female police officers [are far less likely to use force](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/18/women-police-officers-violence/) when apprehending suspects. In 2017,  a survey found that only 11 percent of female officers reported they had ever fired their weapon while on duty, compared with 30 percent of male officers.

I'm always taken aback by the number of men who think that the women pointing out these statistics just hate men, when we just want men to stop abusing women--and each other. And, we actually have common goals. I believe that male socialization is the root of this problem. Men are socialized to suppress their feelings and are taught that anger is one of the only acceptable outlets for their emotions. This is bad for everyone, and derailing the conversation by saying ""but men can also be victims of domestic abuse"" doesn't accomplish anything. We know that it's possible, but it's far less likely given the ways women vs men are socialized and raised.

The American Psychological Association has been doing wonderful work in trying to combat male violence by addressing the ways in which men are socialized: ""The possibility of negative effects of harmful masculinity occurs when negative masculine ideals are upheld. Primary gender role socialization aims to uphold patriarchal codes by requiring men to achieve dominant  and aggressive behaviors (Levant et al., 2003). The concept of gender roles is not cast as a biological phenomenon, but rather a psychological and socially constructed set of ideas that are malleable to change  (Levant & Wilmer, 2011)."" [Source](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/newsletter/2018/09/harmful-masculinity). But then, the APA was condemned by many right-leaning news outlets as ""[attacking masculinity](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/12/psychology-masculinity-men-apa-guidlines).""

I feel like as a whole, women are forbidden to point out male violence as a problem. But nothing will get better if we can't talk about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/ikmyas/posts_condemning_femicide_challenged_in_both/,Posts condemning femicide challenged in both /r/WorldNews and /r/TwoXChromosomes,Vent/Discussion Post ,152,16,0.98,onthemotorway

10kz36r,WomensHealth,1674654743.0,"I‚Äôm 28, I‚Äôve been on birth control since I was 16. Initially it was to regulate my periods and prevent pregnancy. In college, I developed a chronic illness with a lot of pain centering around my pelvic area and, being female, doctors prescribed birth control to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù with the pain (I went off it for a bit before that, not sure why honestly). It did seem to help with the pain on some level. 

That said, I‚Äôve always had a problem getting wet (self-lubricating? I don‚Äôt know the gentle term for this), which, when I was having sex with men, led to a lot of trauma we don‚Äôt need to get into. All of this combined with the birth control itself led to an almost nonexistent sex drive, which led to a lot of fights and sadness between my now-wife and I.

This month, I picked up my birth control late. I had already been off it for a week and my pain wasn‚Äôt any worse. I‚Äôve actually been on new pain meds for over a year, so I figured those would cover whatever pain control the birth control was doing. I decided not to take it, just to see how I felt.

So about three days ago, I (19f) noticed a foul odor coming from the bathroom. You know when you‚Äôre on a road trip and you pass by a large farm? Then you smell all the cow poop? That‚Äôs what it smelled like. I was confused but thought nothing of it. Then yesterday I went to go pee and I noticed the smell was coming directly from ME. I made sure to wipe myself thoroughly because I thought maybe my vagina was being weird (I‚Äôm supposed to start my period soon). Then when I went to pee again later that day that‚Äôs when I really noticed it wasn‚Äôt my vag itself but my actual urine. 

I thought maybe I was drinking something that made it smell that way (I‚Äôve only been reusing a SmartWater bottle and filling it with normal water for at least two days). Now today, I woke up with the feeling that I need to pee really badly. So I went to go pee and it felt itchy in one spot in my vagina. I peed and everything was normal but I sat on the toilet trying to make myself pee again. It felt like something was blocking me from peeing but a little bit of urine came out. I tried again 30 minutes later and then blood started to come out. It wasn‚Äôt a lot but it was enough to freak me out. 

I‚Äôm planning to get a physical and a Pap smear done soon for different reasons but I‚Äôm freaking out. Idk if I should tell my mom and go to urgent care but I‚Äôm scared. It doesn‚Äôt hurt, it just feels like a weird itchy sensation if I try to force myself to pee.

I did use a sex toy last week on the 23rd but I always make sure to thoroughly clean it whenever I use it. I‚Äôve never had sex with another person and I know for a fact I don‚Äôt have a yeast infection.

Update: I called my mom and she‚Äôs on her way. I‚Äôm crying and freaking out right now because I‚Äôm scared that this is now going to my kidneys

Update: I‚Äôm getting antibiotics now, thanks to everyone for urging me to go. Also to those asking why I didn‚Äôt go immediately, I have anxiety and I hate going to the doctors.

It started with waking up in the middle of the night to go pee, which I found really bothersome. Since it bothered me, I started to make an effort to pee before tucking myself in. Now, I have to do it several times before I‚Äôm satisfied. I feel the urge to pee but nothing comes out. 

And no, I do not think it‚Äôs a UTI because I do not have any problems peeing/feeling the urge to pee during the day. It‚Äôs only right before bed, and it‚Äôs worse when i am stressed. 

I met someone who said she had the same problem  and that her fear was peeing the bed. And she overcame it by just accepting the possibility of peeing herself.

 I told my  boyfriend about my experiences and he assured me it's okay and he won't touch me below if I don't want that.  I know it's such a weird thing since it's the easiest way to get off for most women lol.. 

anyway we are in a long distance relationship and don't have much beside phonesex or camsex. 
I stopped using penetrative toys(even tho I only ever came through them) as I feel it takes away the sensitivity when my bf and I have sex, so i started doing  something that never worked for me: flicking the bean. 
 fingering just feels like I'm violating myself so it never feels nice. it's really strange. I told my bf and he suggested that I use a toy if that helps. 

since I didn't have anything I wanted to use,  I looked into the satisfyer as my toy website was recommending it since I can remember. I never got it bc I thought it's a waste of money as clitoral stimulation felt uncomfortable to me.  well  but it was on sale so I grabbed one. 

Trying it on for the first time was SUPER uncomfortable,  I was so tensed I had to force myself to relax, got boyfriend on the call to calm me down and sweet lord jesus and holy mary that thing changed me.  

it's been a few weeks and I'm not 100% relaxed while using it but I feel like it really helped getting used to clitoral stimulation. the orgasms are out of this world. I tried fingering and even that's better than before.  I'm sure there is some deep psychological reason for all that but all I can say is that in those 9 years of being sexually active, I've never felt this good on my own, I feel like I have rediscovered masturbating lol

But most importantly thank you for making me feel understood and valid for the way I‚Äôm feeling & allowing me to understand that I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for me. That‚Äôs the biggest take away I‚Äôve received.

I wanted to provide a small update. I decided to terminate the pregnancy. After going to planned parenthood today it was confirmed that I‚Äôm 5 weeks pregnant. While speaking to my doctor I told her my concerns about work and not wanting to miss. I didn‚Äôt want to take the pills today or tomorrow but honestly had no choice, which I 100% understood. 

The doctor was so wonderful, the amount of calmness and reassurance she gave me was unbelievable. She was so great and I am so thankful to have had her to guide me through this process. She gave me a doctors note and provided me with different ways to tell my work why I won‚Äôt be showing up. Which I greatly appreciated.

Emotionally I‚Äôm a mess, I know this is the right decision for me and my significant other but it‚Äôs still so hard. I was able to see the baby and that made it real and honestly that‚Äôs when I completely lost it. 

My brother, boyfriend, and best friend have been my rock. I don‚Äôt know what I would do without them and their support.

I am so nervous for the pills I‚Äôm taking tomorrow. I‚Äôve heard they are terrible and is the worst experience. If anyone has gone through this and would like to share their experience please message me I would greatly appreciate it.

I recently discovered 2 lumps on my  Cervix, one is very small like a pinhead, the other is larger, like a ball bearing. Both are smooth, solid, non-painful and non-oozy (sorry that's ever so gross a way to put it). 

I've had lots of problems with endometriosis and am a good advocate for my health and well being in general... so off I popped to the doctor, I described what I had found, he looked at me like I was insane... then said, ""the cervix is very high up you know, are you sure you were feeling that? "" 

I said, ""yes, of course, I know what's normal with my body, can you please perform an exam and let me know if I should be concerned.""  I feel I was straightforward if a little bit curt, but not rude and not demanding... 

He then said "" well I can't even perform pelvic exams as I've not kept up with training and am no longer allowed"" he then leaned towards me and said in utter disbelief ""women can't usually feel their cervix.. What WERE you doing up THERE"" (capital letters for his raised eyebrows)

I asked if there was anyone else who could perform an exam and he told me the nurse, but I can't get an appointment until March... tbh I really want to leave the GP practice after that experience, I felt really uncomfortable, it was deeply inappropriate and undermining to my concerns...

I still need to get it checked out, all things on the internet point to it being a harmless nabothian cyst but does anyone here think I should be more worried??

A few weeks (months?) ago a video went kinda viral on reddit of a guy that helps his girlfriend during her period. She‚Äôs filmed laying in bed and suffering like crazy. I feel bad - no, we probably all feel bad for her - because we know how this feels. Her boyfriend goes to the grocery store and buys her all kind of food and drinks and puts on a movie for her while she snuggles on the couch.

Well, this is actually great, he cares for her and makes sure she‚Äôs comfortable during her excruciating pain. But why, WHY, does this need to be filmed? People were praising the guy as if he cured cancer, while in my opinion taking care of your sick partner is the bare minimum. He‚Äôs sweet for doing this, but why do you need validation from people? This is not about you dude and if you have to film getting your girlfriend chocolate because how else would people know you don‚Äôt invalidate your partners pain your missing the point IMO.  

I know there are a lot of guys who do this without feeling the need to be treated like the founder of empathy, so I‚Äôm absolutely not saying this is typically a man‚Äôs thing to do, but I get so tired of people jerking off over the fact they were nice to their suffering girlfriend.

I mention the age gap just to give insight into the power dynamic of the relationship as well as the gap in sexual experience. I was a virgin, no one had so much as seen my vagina, and this guy had had sex a substantial number of times. A lot was wrong with the relationship, but the break up was incredibly bad and it culminated in him insulting me physically. He told me that he had found me disgusting and that my vagina was gross and smelled bad. This was the first person I had ever loved, and our relationship was very codependent, so the sudden break up and insults were very traumatic for me. 

It‚Äôs been 3 years since all this has happened, and I‚Äôve gained a lot of insight in terms of vaginal health as well as how toxic that relationship was. He was a grown man dating a minor in high school, which is what was really disgusting, and now I‚Äôm educated on all the nuances of vaginal smells. I know logically that my vagina is healthy, however, I just can‚Äôt get rid of the feeling that my vagina is disgusting, and in turn of that, I as a person am disgusting. It‚Äôs really affected my relationship with my vagina, and although I‚Äôve made some progress, I seem to have this underlying fear that my vagina is going to cause potential partners to leave me once they‚Äôve had sex with me. My last ex-boyfriend (not the one previously described) sort of distanced himself about 3 months into the relationship, and although I knew it was because we didn‚Äôt really have that great of a connection, I can‚Äôt help but feel that my vagina is what drove him away. I also wouldn‚Äôt let him eat me out just because I was that scared/embarrassed. My current boyfriend is pretty amazing in regards to boundaries and sex, and I actually feel comfortable with him going down on me, but whenever he‚Äôs eating me out I can‚Äôt fully focus because there‚Äôs that nagging insecurity at the back of mind. It really sucks that I can‚Äôt seem to get over this because I feel like it‚Äôs such a big obstacle in terms of me actually enjoying sex, and I just want to see my vagina in a positive light.

Last time I posted about this on 2X (kinda decided fuck it, I‚Äôm leaving reddit anyway so I‚Äôll post a rant) I got a lot of support and validation and it meant a lot that all these women understood. Thought I‚Äôd stick around a little longer.

But today I just feel defeated. Why can‚Äôt we talk about women‚Äôs issues without men shutting us down?

The amount of UTIs, yeast infections, BV, etc that I‚Äôve dealt with in the last year...really makes you think about how women used to just deal with it. I also just don‚Äôt understand how these things go away on their own. A few times I‚Äôve tried to wait out infections and it‚Äôs like they do not get better without medication...this stuff is bad enough with medication to provide some semblance of relief.

Also a rant because I‚Äôm just so frustrated with my body. Since taking the last round of antibiotics for a recurrent UTI I seem to have developed quite the yeast infection.

15rjqcn,Healthyhooha,1692078585.0,"Hello.  I‚Äôm a 21-year-old autistic woman.  Last week I went to the gynecologist to get my first check up where the doctor checked my breasts, did cervical cancer testing, and STD testing.  I was positive that all my results would come back negative because I‚Äôm a virgin.  The only reason why I did the check up was because my primary care doctor recommended that I should and she said that I was due for cervical cancer screening.  I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend or sexual contact of any kind with anyone.  I‚Äôve never even kissed anyone.

To my shock, today I got my results back.  I tested positive for Gonorrhea.  Everything else came back negative.  At first I thought that this must‚Äôve been a mistake because I‚Äôm a virgin and I have no symptoms associated with it.  How could it be possible for me to have an STD?  But the lady who told me about my results said that the test that the doctor gave me is usually accurate and that she wants to immediately put me on medication.  She also said that people who have it can be asymptomatic.

I feel dirty, impure, and disgusted with myself.  Even though I know for sure that I‚Äôm a virgin, the idea of possibly having an STD disgusts me so much.  Not only that, there‚Äôs a lot of stigma associated with STDs.  I don‚Äôt want my family to turn on me and think I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwh*re‚Äù.  I know that innocent people who try to be responsible can still get STDs, but the stigma still lingers on my mind.  I don‚Äôt want people to think I‚Äôm a liar when I say that I‚Äôm a virgin.  I am a virgin and it‚Äôs the truth.  That diagnosis is like a stain on my reputation as a virgin.  One of the main reasons why I want to wait until marriage to lose my virginity is to avoid catching STDs.  Another reason is that it just makes me feel a sense of pride.

I‚Äôm also scared because now I‚Äôm wondering how I could‚Äôve gotten it and how there could be something I don‚Äôt know about that might‚Äôve caused my test to come back positive.

Now I‚Äôm wondering how I even got it.  I‚Äôve used tampons before, and I‚Äôve put my fingers inside my vagina to pull out discharge (when I‚Äôm ovulating) or period blood (when I‚Äôm on my period), but I always wash my hands before doing so.  I‚Äôve never used sex toys.  I‚Äôve hugged friends before, but that‚Äôs the closest I‚Äôve gotten in terms of physical contact with people.  I don‚Äôt always use toilet seat covers in public restrooms if it looks clean.  I got a vaccine (for HIV I think) in July that wouldn‚Äôt need to be boosted for another 10 years.  I‚Äôve never gone to parties or stayed at anyone‚Äôs house in the last 10 years, as I‚Äôm an introvert.  I have eczema on my vulva, armpits, and the back of my knees; I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs relevant since I didn‚Äôt see eczema listed as a symptom for Gonorrhea.

Can anyone tell me how I could‚Äôve gotten Gonorrhea while still being a virgin?

Also, is there any test that can be done to prove my virginity?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/15rjqcn/im_a_virgin_and_i_just_tested_positive_for/,I‚Äôm a virgin and I just tested positive for Gonorrhea.

Unfortunately a side effect of stem cell transplants is graft versus host disease (GVHD). Ive started showing signs in my mouth and wrists, I.E. Skin tightening, white patches, burning sensations. Overall its mild and treatable.
My oncologist talked to me about seeing a gynocologist-oncologist due to potentially having GVHD in my genitals. Ths gyno-onc i first saw did NOT listen to me at all. The reason I was reccomended was debilitating pain in my genitals. He never mentioned my cancer, my transplant, GVHD, or pain!! He just kept talking over me and didnt even listen. Thankfully he prescribed me estrogen and progesterone. He never really told me why, I had to google to find out it could help w the pain.

I told my oncologist about the visit and she was so mad. He didnt care about my pain at all!! She reccomended a NEW gyno who had worked with other women affected by GVHD, thank god.

I saw her a month later and she was AMAZING!! She listened, sympathized, and new a lot about my history (it seems she did the bare minimum of READING MY CHART!! Unlike a certain gyno...). She prescribed two different topical creams which will get rid of the pain!! After the appointment i cried, for a good reason this time. I just feel heard and seen amd listened to.

She also changed my estrogen and progesterone. Since I have a certain brand of IUD it gives me enough progesterone, so im off that pill now. And the estrogen dose I was on was too low for my age.

Just the 'basic' ones to get a general idea of what is going on. We could see fluctuations, and actively predict infections.   
We could know if it was a yeast infection, BV or something else. Could give the pH level also or whatever relevant information to give an accurate result - or be able to send the results to a professional for diagnosis. 

Why hasn't this been done before? Is it too expensive to to make such a product? Or maybe its not possible to test for cultures in an 'at-home' setting?

I have been seeing this doctor since I was younger because I went on birth control in high school. I have never had a Pap smear, just a pelvic exam so I was very nervous for my appointment today. My appointment was at 11:15 but I did not get called back to the room until about 12:15. The nurse came in and asked me questions and told me to get undressed. I asked her to tell my doctor that I have a lot of anxiety right now because I am a senior in nursing school and have a lot on my plate. The nurse left the room and I sat naked for about ten minutes before my doctor comes in accompanied by a student nurse practitioner who goes to my school. My doctor then proceeds to TELL me that the student is going to sit in for my exam. My doctor didn‚Äôt even do a pap, just a pelvic and she let the student ( who I go to school with) watch. I was so uncomfortable and embarrassed. She then scheduled for me to have a Pap smear in 6 months which is what I came in for today and I was charged 40$ for the copay.

bki16j,Healthyhooha,1556948669.0,"Hey folks,

I see recommendations for bidets here and they can be a great solution for improved hygiene and, when used carefully, may be helpful at reducing UTIs.

But that comes with one big caveat which I haven't seen discussed yet and it comes in the form of a very common bacterium named 'Serratia marcescens'.

**What is S. marcescens?**

[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serratia_marcescens) is: (abridged, my emphasis, from here on ""SM"")

> a species of rod-shaped, Gram-negative bacteria classified as an opportunistic pathogen. SM is commonly involved in hospital-acquired infections, particularly catheter-associated bacteremia, **urinary tract infections**, and wound infections. It is commonly found in the respiratory and **urinary tracts** of hospitalized adults and in the gastrointestinal systems of children. Due to its abundant presence in the environment, and its preference for damp conditions, **SM is commonly found growing in bathrooms (especially on tile grout, shower corners, toilet water lines, and basins), where it manifests as a pink, pink-orange, or orange discoloration and slimy film** feeding off phosphorus-containing materials or fatty substances such as soap and shampoo residue.

Have you ever seen any of those bathrooms where a bright pink/bright orange or rusty orange film has accumulated? Sometimes appearing in the bottom of sinks or especially at the bottom of unclean shower curtains?

That's almost certainly our good friend, SM. You might have seen it in ice makers or water dispenser lines too.

SM is much more likely to accumulate on unclean surfaces which are damp or constantly wet, and where there is hard water or nutrients to feed on. It can be stubborn to clean as it forms a film, so simply rinsing or spraying with a cleaning solution and giving it a gentle wipe is not likely to be sufficient to remove SM. Even if you remove all visible traces of SM with wiping, it's likely that small amounts of it will be left behind ready to recolonize as soon as they can.


...I bet that you know where I'm going with this.

**Your bidet may be a reservoir for SM bacteria, which may be introducing them into your urinary tract.**

So, what do?

* Check for the characteristic bright or ruddy orange/pink color of the SM biofilm, especially around holes or rims and edges of your bidet.

* If you find it, give the film a good scrub with a stiff brush and a mix of a little soap and some baking soda, ensuring to scrub all surfaces, holes etc. thoroughly

* Sterilize the bidet using a bleach solution or other disinfectant, following instructions for sterilization of plastic object. (**Being extremely careful not to mix bleach or other sterilizing solutions with cleaning products!!**)

* Rinse well

* Use as normal

And remember to always clean your bidet when you clean your toilet!

&nbsp;

This isn't likely to be the #1 source of UTIs but if you're sensitive to them or you are struggling with them despite doing everything right, it might be that you're unintentionally exposing yourself to SM without realizing it when you use a bidet.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/bki16j/im_spraying_what_where_serratia_marcescens_a/,I'm spraying *what* *where*!? | Serratia marcescens: a cautionary tale for bidet-users,,147,11,0.98,Randolf_Schnitzler

I know a lot of women get UTIs after sex and I was one of them. It got worse and worse until literally every time I had sex I would get one even if we both showered/cleaned beforehand and I peed, used D-mannose, even used a bidet after. 

So I caved and went to a good urologist. I was hesitant because my experience with doctors has not been good, I end up spending time and money and nothing changes. But I am happy to report that is not the case. Because antibiotics often give me yeast infections, he put me on a medication called methenamine hippurate that acidifies your urine and I guess prevents bacteria from growing. I have not had a UTI since!! I don‚Äôt even have to immediately pee or use d-mannose and it is life changing. 

The doctor said he wants to see me UTI free for six months before taking me off the meds and that should hopefully be long enough for my body to reset it‚Äôs natural defenses.

Want to know why I'm unhappy and why I'm not smiling? 


It feels like my insides are being twisted and tugged as well as being punched and ripped apart. And it's not only my insides that feel like that - my vagina feels like it is being pulled open and something too big is trying to get inside it.

My entire body is having spasms and aches and the stabbing pain in my back is so bad I can't exist comfortably and everything I do is making me cripple over in pain. My thighs, calves and hips ache and hurt so walking is now a conscious effort that it shouldn't be.

The bloating. This isn't just a bloated feeling. No. You physically expand and blost. Your trousers now cut into your stomach and waist leaving dents on your body and your bra feels like it is made of razors. When you undress at the end of the day the marks left all over your body look like you've been in a war. 

Accompanying the bloat is the nausea. The constant feeling of am I going to be sick and having no appetite BUT I also want to eat everything bad for me. Yes, including that food I explicitly hate. I want it. 

Your breasts become so sore and tender that even wearing a fitted coat feels painful on your chest. Also lying down in bed is no longer comfortable because where are your boobs meant to go now? They hurt no matter what they're doing.

I constantly need the toilet, but what do I need? Who knows! What was that cramp? Was it me peeing? Was it me having an accident? Did I leak blood? All of the above? I feel like I have taken 100 laxatives and they're working their way through my body all the time.

The toilets at work are also great. Let's try and find a comfortable way to take out and put in a tampon or menstrual cup or change a pad in a tiny cubicle where there might be other people around. Also do I smell? Is anyone else smelling me or am I good...?

And no, I can't smile for you because my skin is so dry that stretching my lips into something resembling a smile will make them crack and bleed, as well as the rest of my face somehow being so dry it is peeling but also producing spots at an alarming rate. 

Your insecurities are at an all time high and you hate yourself so much you can't bear anyone to look at you. You don't even want to look at yourself because for these 7 days especially, you hate what you see in the mirror. 

Following on from this are the mood swings. Whatever you say to me might make me cry, angry, insecure etc.

Personally, I don‚Äôt believe women are supposed to suffer as they do. For half the time, most women are losing mass amounts of vital nutrients by menstruating. Serious calcium deficiency is what causes the detriment to the nervous system. This is why so many women have anxiety.

A theory is that the hormone disrupters in modern foods actually cause periods. If we were healthy we wouldn‚Äôt have a period. (If you want to hear more about this theory please look up Dr Delbert Blair- ‚ÄòThe Woman Lecture‚Äô- on YouTube:)

Gotta get back on it bc eating ‚Äòwhatever‚Äô makes me feel suicidal. For half the time I feel sick. For 10 days I pms (suicidal thoughts) and then bleed heavily/ have cramps for 4 days (more suicidal thoughts).

1bbg8xi,WomensHealth,1710092876.0,"IUDs DON'T HAVE TO HURT!! DEMAND PAIN MANAGEMENT FROM YOUR OBGYN.

IUDs can be a fabulous solution to all of your birth control needs (though, like any medical procedure or medication, they don't work for everyone). They can be quick and painless to be placed and give you up to 10 years of protection depending on which device you choose.

If/when you get your first IUD or when you get an IUD removed or replaced, talk to your provider when you book your appointment (many times, speaking directly with the provider is necessary) about how you expect to be treated (like a human who can feel pain) and confirm that they will have lidocaine gel available to apply to your cervix at the very beginning of the appointment followed by a paracervical block injection before insertion or removal/replacement is attempted. I recommend calling the day before your appointment to confirm these details and also considering confirming this plan before putting your feet in the stirrups to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Louder for those in the back: IUDs DON'T HAVE TO HURT!! DEMAND PAIN MANAGEMENT FROM YOUR OBGYN.

On January first, I started having what looked like discharge, but it was nearly black. It lasted for three days and then it was over. It didn‚Äôt look like a period, I expected it to be more of a lighter color. Fast forward to today, and it is happening again. It is more of a brownish color, and is very gooey (much like discharge). I tried to google it, but nothing really told me an answer, so this is my next best option. A couple days before, I did have a sore lower back and bloating, and also abnormally thick discharge, but I just nudged it off.

kvuegw,Healthyhooha,1610467346.0,"I just want to scream. Since Sept, sex has been painful and bloody. I‚Äôve seen 5 diff doctors (I‚Äôm not even 21 yet so getting Pap smears from 5 strangers in a condensed period of time has been nothing short of stressful and anxiety-provoking), had a UTI, yeast infection, and BV (all I think stemming from hot tub sex). Anyway none of the treatments improved my sensitive and raw hooha... so finally I find out on my very own that there‚Äôs a tear in my coochie. Go back to doctor, show her and she can barely find it herself. Orders no sex for ten days, desitin application daily, and sitz or epsom baths. Did that for thirteen days, nothing heals. I go back, and now her theory is that being on hormonal birth control for five years has seriously weakened my vaginal tissue (a rare but possible problem, even more rare that it‚Äôs causing tearing and not just pain). When she simply put the friggin speculum in it caused a tear & bleeding. 

So my vagina is all weak and fragile. So she suggested I stop taking my hormonal birth control and start using a hormone cream daily for a month (no sex for a whole month either). AND to top it off she said I tested positive for bacterial vaginosis AGAIN even though I just fucking treated it so now I am having to take my fourth round of antibiotics in the past five months. 

I‚Äôm so flustered and I‚Äôm sad that I got the short end of the stick in terms of the unspoken side effects of birth control.

i3u2zm,TwoXSupport,1596582852.0,"In Hannah Gadsby's Netflix special Nanette (which I think is a must-watch for literally everyone), she describes how, by presenting in a traditionally ""masculine"" way, she is considered by many to be ""incorrectly female."" On top of the obvious hatred coming her way from straight people, this has also been an issue with the queer community as well. She goes on to say how she was confronted and told that she ""owes it to her community to come out as transgender."" Well, the thing is, she's not transgender. She's a woman who is, apparently, existing incorrectly.

I'm just so tired of people thinking that there is only one way to be a woman: adhering to traditionally ""feminine"" stereotypes. And then assuming that if you don't feel kinship with those sexist stereotypes, you must not be a woman.

I would describe myself as gender-non-conforming in presentation, since I wear my hair short, I don't shave, and my wardrobe is majority menswear. I feel deeply uncomfortable in dresses and makeup. I was held up at the airport by TSA because they thought I was a man, and my scan came up wrong. However, I feel comfortable in my own body (most of the time, anyway), and comfortable being a woman in my own way. But I don't know if I like the word ""cis"" to describe myself, since I don't want it to be assumed that I'm comfortable with our strict definition of woman. *That* definition is what makes me uncomfortable. Wearing dresses causes me dysphoria, but I feel damn good as a woman-identifying-female in a suit.

Pre-covid, I had an experience that really bothered me, wherein I was interacting with a group of women who started using ""they/them"" pronouns to reference me without asking me what I'd prefer. Now, I'm not offended by that, since I believe that they meant well. But I'm sad that we're at a point in our cultural dialog where if a woman doesn't look how we think she should look, then we conclude that she must not be a woman. That just seems deeply un-feminist to me. I wish that we could avoid assumptions about people's gender identities. I wish that we could understand that not conforming to traditional notions of the gender assigned to you doesn't mean that you're not that gender. Instead, I want us to expand the notion of what that gender--and more specifically, what womanhood--can look like.

EDIT: Edit to clarify that I don't take issue with the word ""cis"" as a whole; I just was musing about whether or not I felt that it accurately describes me since I have complex feelings about my relationship to my own gender.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/i3u2zm/on_hannah_gadsby_gender_and_being_incorrectly/,"On Hannah Gadsby, gender, and being ""incorrectly female""",Vent/Discussion Post ,142,17,0.97,onthemotorway

I thought it was the acidic blood during my period that was getting rid of the thick white discharge, but now looking back it must have just been the hydration my vagina was getting during my time of month. 

Before my treatment, pH testing strips (when not on period) tested my vagina to a level of ~8/9 (so super alkaline) so I‚Äôm guessing the extra hydration is bringing me down more to an acidic level, since the thick white discharge is gone. I realize the solution sounds very simple but even when I thought I was drinking more water during the day, I was still not hitting my recommended daily water intake. 

Also, I have used the GCL vaginal gel when not drinking enough water, and it does not get rid of the discharge. So hitting your recommended daily water intake really is key here. 


TLDR-hydration may affect your vaginal pH, causing some issues down there.

j8dblq,WomensHealth,1602300228.0,"Holy cow...so...I am the girl who went from worrying whether her ovary is dead or not to battling ovarian cancer. Well, I am here with an update on something I expected to be much more minor than it was.

I got a PET scan before my chemo, and the ones who did it seemed concerned about one of my lungs...they said there was a bit of fluid in it. I must admit, I didn't think much of it due to the couple of weeks I was holding back coughing due to recovering from surgery, as well as the sinus troubles I was having. Thing is...when I went in for chemo, my doctor said it was concerning enough that she referred me for a possible lung draining. That appointment was today. I had no idea how serious the situation actually was.

For those who do not know what lung draining is, they basically numb you up, slide a needle into your affected lung cavity, replace the needle with a catheter, and drain the fluid. It is not comfortable, and in all honesty it was terrifying to me. However, if all goes smoothly the process is surprisingly short, and you are out of the hospital same-day. Yes, the needle hurts, and while they definitely can numb you, there is no numbing agent that can keep you from feeling that needle. I had to have a friend keep a vice-grip on my head until it went in and was replaced by the catheter.

By the time it was finished, they took 2 liters from my right lung. I...I had no words outside of the coughing. That was in me. I don't even know how I held that much. They said my lung was like a tiny little sponge because of it. I thought this trouble breathing was due to my recovering diaphragm. Nope, apparently I have been building this liquid since I was out of surgery, and I have been functioning on pretty much a single lung. I went into anaphylactic shock the other day with one working lung.

I have been through varying stages of mental freak-outs trying to figure out how this whole thing works.

Thankfully, the doctors and nurses are expecting my other lung to grow back to normal over the next couple of days now that it has the room. How, I don't know. I am just really, really glad they are so confident of that. Now I am sitting here in bed, breathing deeply and listening to my creaky little lung as it slowly takes back to breathing, and coaxing it to take in as much as it can...all the while grateful that I have never been a smoker. These little guys are strong...

So, hopefully, that should tie up any more surprises for now. I will try to add a picture that my friend took of one of the bottles when I figure out how to.

Eventually after trying to look down there to figure out why I couldn‚Äôt take out a tampon regularly, I saw some kind of thin tissue piece that was holding onto my tampon (real pleasant). 

It wasn‚Äôt until last night that I looked up why I may not be able to take out my tampon so easily. 

Hymen abnormalities. I have NEVER heard of this. It was only through some researching that I discovered that this could be my reason. 

While I haven‚Äôt seen a doctor for this, I believe I may have a septate hymen. Now, I just have to do some maneuvering to use tampons, but I am so glad I‚Äôve learned some more about the female body.

Cramps from walking too much and standing too long. Can't sit up straight while on my period because of the pain, so I hunch over with a heating pad. Weird discharge like I've never seen. Blood clots and spotting randomly all the time. 

I told 4 different obgyns all of this over the last couple years and everytime they give me a pap and say my strings look great and my tests are all normal.

I‚Äôve really kept my opinions to myself but last night this lady that has no tubes whatsoever due to endometriosis and has to do ivf to get pregnant posted this pic about to all the couples trying to get pregnant and can‚Äôt then see all these ppl wanting to abort their unborn child. I‚Äôm sorry.  

Like ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôm sorry about your situation because if you want to be a mother and can‚Äôt or struggle or like her have to use ivf that‚Äôs unfortunate but how can you sit there and benefit from reproductive science? medical procedures? And then be unsympathetic to other forms of it?

I honestly don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any woman that‚Äôs just like OMG YES IM READY TO ABORT THIS BABY with like this lustrous thirst ppl are acting like they do. I‚Äôve never been in the position where I‚Äôd need an abortion but I can only imagine it‚Äôs not a decision someone would take lightly. 

But what I asked her is what would she do if they started regulating ivf? Since the government loves regulating or bodies? She didn‚Äôt reply to me..

I didn‚Äôt wanna be hurtful so I didn‚Äôt say this but I‚Äôve seen ppl make a religious point to it. That it‚Äôs God‚Äôs will for someone to be pregnant. Well ok then, how would she feel if someone told her it was God‚Äôs will she couldn‚Äôt get pregnant? 

I just don‚Äôt get it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm a mother of one and I worry about my daughter‚Äôs future. Hell I worry about myself. 

I‚Äôve scheduled counseling for sterilization. I was going to end of May/beginning of June after I got a few things out of the way but then my daughter got strep and that took awhile to fully get over.  I wish I could‚Äôve got in sooner tbh because I‚Äôm scared now that option will be taken away from me. I‚Äôve been trying to convince my dr since my daughter was born 5yrs ago to do it. 

Now I‚Äôve finally got my foot in the door I don‚Äôt want it slammed in my face. I‚Äôm honestly scared they‚Äôll start messing with birth control. We‚Äôre one and done.

vjgp58,WomensHealth,1656047799.0,"I just had the absolute worst experience with a doctor I have ever had, and that's saying something.

I don't have insurance so everything is out of pocket and expensive AF.  I don't go unless I am absolutely sure I have to.  It has been probably 7 years since I have gone to the doctor. (Been in the ER a couple of times but that's different) Fortunately, I am pretty healthy and I want to stay that way.

And this is where it all goes wrong.

I'm 47 and I am one of the Big Girls.  Back in December, I decided to change that.  I have lost 100 pounds which puts me just under half of my weight loss goal.  I'm eating healthy and exercising...a LOT.  My goal is not weight loss, but to live a healthy life and that means rewriting 40+ years of bad habits. I have gone from barely being able to stand long enough to play Beat Saber to walking several miles a day.  I am proud of myself.  This is the hardest thing I have EVER done. 

Today I went to the doctor for three reasons.  No, I hadn't seen this doctor before so I had to do the full physical work-up and at the time I thought was worth it.   1. I need a new prescription for an EpiPen because I am allergic to bees (Confirmed anaphylaxis if I am stung) and my neighbor has several hives.  2.  My allergies are out of control and nothing seems to help.  3. Have a CBC run just to be sure nothing is out of whack...it's been 7 years! (Blood was drawn several days ago, I was getting the results today)

I left in tears, without the scripts I needed, two scripts I didn't need, and minus $275. 

The things he said to me included...

\~\~\~

""I just have trouble believing you have lost all that weight""  so I showed him my FitBit with all my recorded workouts and the app to my scale that shows my weight loss week by week.  ""Well, it's pretty easy to fake those things.""

\~\~\~

HIM: ""How much alcohol do you drink?""

Me: ""Very rarely.  It's been at least a year.""

HIM:  ""So you are in recovery? You shouldn't drink at all if you are.""

ME: ""Where did you get that idea?  I just don't really like it, I don't see the point of it.""

HIM: ""What about illegal drugs?""

ME: ""None.  And not ever.""  

HIM:  ""Are you sure?""

ME:  ""I think I would know if I was using drugs""

HIM: ""I'll have \*nurses name\* send some literature home with you about addiction.""

\~\~\~

""I have no doubt you are diabetic.  It's a given with people your size.""  My A1C is 4.6 and yes he had the lab results in front of him. 

\~\~\~

""You really should consider weight loss surgery because you will gain it all back if you don't.""

\~\~\~

HIM ""Have you considered seeing a therapist?""  in response to me asking for a prescription for an EpiPen.  

ME: ""Not unless the therapist is going to bring me an EpiPen""

HIM:  ""I don't like your attitude""

\~\~\~

And my personal favorite...

HIM: ""I'm not writing you a prescription for narcotics.""

ME:  ""WHAT THE HELL?  I didn't ask for any!""

HIM: ""You came in with a laundry list of medical problems.  It was just a matter of time before you asked for something.""

\~\~\~

It has been 12 hours and I am still just absolutely stunned. I don't even know how to process this.  He continually talked over me and interrupted me.  He ignored direct questions and twisted my answers no matter what I said.  He outright called me a liar twice and kept asking about my depression.  I hadn't said a single word about depression but he brought it up at least 3 times. The ironic thing is I actually have a degree in medical anthropology. I have been a patient advocate and have even helped clinics establish protocols for this exact situation.  

He wrote me a script for diabetes (Glucophage) and high blood pressure (lisinopril) but my blood pressure was low normal. I don't have high blood pressure, never have. His nurse handed me a packet with all kinds of pamphlets ranging from how to quit smoking (I don't smoke) to addiction to weight loss.  There was a list of therapists and bariatric clinics and a photocopied booklet called ""Inspiring Scriptures and Prayers"".

And no, this is not a free clinic.  I paid full freight for this after this jerk came highly recommended by several friends.  Ironically they are all very slender women. 

I was nothing but a number on a scale.  

I have never felt more invisible or more alone in my life. 

I don't even know if this will stay up. I don't know if this is the right place or if there is a better place but I needed to vent this before it made me cry again.  The friends who recommended him are saying that I am being overly sensitive and that he was just trying to help me, so there is untold drama on my FB page. The battle lines are being drawn between the people who believe me and the people who think I am seeking attention.  

The only thing I know for sure is that I am looking for another doctor and that it will probably be another 7 years before I go again.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/vjgp58/see_you_in_seven_years/,See You In Seven Years...,Rant,136,50,0.99,BeatMeSaber

&#x200B;

As of last week, I've finally tested negative for BV. I've had BV for about 2 years but let me preface that I had no idea I had it / started to treat it until **May** of this year.

The reason  I didn't know I had it was because I thought all of the symptoms were normal (itching, red a bit swollen, a lot of discharge, yellow in color, the smell was never that bad so I guess that's why I didn't go to a gyno. I attributed it all to hormonal change and estrogen.

I've tested negative last week, and I don't want to say I've been cured yet because I am currently on my period and I want to see what happens after. I will make an update.

I want to also say that since **May** I've tried many many things to get rid of this, so I genuinely don't know what helped me to finally test negative. So I will break everything I since then until now.

It wasn't until this past March that my discharge turned from yellow to bright green. That's when I freaked out and googled, and it brought me to this thread and learned about BV and realized I had it all this time.

*I also haven't been sexually active for about a year and a half.*

So here's my timeline:

**May 14th - June 20th:** I started doing NutraBlast Boric Acid Vaginal Suppositories (1 week) and Rephresh Pro-B Probiotics (whole 30 days)

*Sometime around this time, I got my period but I did see a change in the amount of discharge and smell, and the itching was kinda gone. The green color was still prominent and I was still a bit red and swollen.*

**June 22nd:** Gyno appt. Got a pap and was prescribed drum roll, please... METRONIDAZOLE. She also gave me a refill because it might come back. So I did the round of metro plus boric acid for 7 days.  I had finished my probiotics last month so I didn't continue these.

I CHANGED ALL OF MY UNDERWEAR ALL OF THEM,

**June 24th - July 23rd:**  I was clear from all symptoms. I didn't get tested so I have no idea if it really went away around this time.

**July 24th- August 3rd:** A couple of days before my period I started to get the symptoms again. This time it wasn't the large amounts of discharge or smell, but just swollen and red, and itchy, watery discharge.

So I bought **Rephresh Pro-B Probiotics** again and started the second refill of metro plus **boric acid.**

On **July 24th** I started taking [Vitamin D3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DN4VCA2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and [Vitamin B Complex with Vitamin C and Folic Acid.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014D2GEK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

*( I haven't stopped taking these and I take them every day.)*

**August 4th -** When my period went away I still had the same symptoms. just swollen and red, and itchy, watery discharge.

**August 11th**  I called my gyno and she barely let me talk and she just gave my fluconazole and another round of metro. I ordered a new probiotic [AZO Complete balance](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074BLLV81/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

**August 12th - August 22nd:**  Metro, Fluconazole, probiotics,

**August 29th:** Still hasn't gone away so I got another type of probiotics to go with the Azo ones. [Culturelle Women's](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079G4N8K2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).

I have stopped taking boric acid because I think it was making it worse.

**Sept 4th-Sept 18th:** Got a new gyno for a second opinion and she was incredibly sweet and empathetic and familiar with everything BV. I told her this exact timeline, and she said this is a chronic thing sadly so we might have to just manage it with boric acid and probiotics. But only if the antibiotics she was going to give me didn't work... [SOLOSEC](https://www.solosec.com/). It was in backorder so I didn't get it until the 17th of September.

**Sept 18th - Sept 28th** I took the Solosec (one dose of granules in yogurt), while still taking the Azo (**5 billion**) and the Culturelle (**15 billion**) and I added [Renew Life](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CCCNISU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ( **90 billion** which is the highest of the probiotics I've taken) , and I added a vaginal suppository called [Probaclac](https://www.probaclac.ca/vaginal-probiotics-for-bv) ( **8 billion** per capsules a 14-day treatment but I did 7) and [Trader Joes Plain Kefir](https://images.app.goo.gl/jqLAVQb6f7YffTaC9) a cup every morning and keep in mind still taking the vitamins.

At this point, I felt a change, day, and night change... but I HAD NO IDEA WHAT WAS NORMAL ANYMORE. No watery discharge, no itching, my vagina wasn't swollen or red anymore... It's never looked this pink and ""normal"" in a long time. But I still had yellowish greenish discharge so I was not convinced.

**Sept 28th - October 2nd** I had my follow-up. I even told her that I wasn't convinced I didn't know what was normal anymore I cried a bit. She examined me, and I begged for a full panel of everything and she did. She also said that everything in there looked normal, but had to wait for the results. She asked what probiotics I was on and at this point, I had run out of AZO and Culturelle, and was taking just Renew Life 90 billion and she said this was great and that she recommends anything above 30 billion.

**October 2nd:** Got the call that everything was negative. I even said "" NO WAY!"" in the call and the lady laughed.

**October 4th:** I got my period and I still have it. So I will see what happens after and I will make an update next week when it's gone.

I promise I will make one because there are people who say they will and they don't.

If you asked me what helped I think it was just all the probiotics I took at once ( a total of 166 billion a day plus the Kefir Milk with live cultures) after the one dose of Solosec.

I still have 7 days of the probiotic suppositories just in case. I will give it a week after my period to see.

Because... I'm still not convinced haha.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

UPDATE: october 16th

It's been a week since my period ended, and I have no signs of BV. My discharge is slightly yellow but I'm starting to realize that it might be ""my"" normal discharge.

I'll be back in 3 weeks with a monthly update.

still BV free, so I'm p sure this time is for good.

Once I switched to tampons, I started to be OK with having my period. I'm not sure when this started (I think probably after I started staying at home to finish my final year of university and also switched to a cup), but now I love being on my period. Perhaps it's because I feel I have an excuse to lay in bed and do nothing? Perhaps it's because I know I'm not pregnant? The coolness of using a cup and not having leaks etc definitely adds to it. Most of all I feel... Feminine? Like my body is working? Don't know how to describe it. 

The weirdest part is that I love the cramps. I got an IUD a little over a year back, and I love the cramps I get during my period. I get sharp, stabbing pains and I actually like getting them because it means I can get in bed and curl up.

ia3smc,WomensHealth,1597479928.0,"WARNING: please don‚Äôt read if you are squimish because I go into a few graphics details about child birth.

There are a hundreds of topic I could go into here but my own personal experiences are unexplained infertility and dysmenorrhoea. 

My dysmenorrhea is debilitating. It will floor me whether I‚Äôm at work, at home or in the supermarket and I have passed out from the pain before. The most they will do in the UK is scan you for fibroids, do a blood test or two and generally the results come back normal. The next step is then to dose you with hormone-affecting drugs like the Pill or Mini-Pill to basically just mask the issue rather than getting to the route of the problem.

I really wanted to try for a baby but the thought of coming off the pill frightened me. For 5 years I suffered excruciating pain every 26 days whilst I tried to get pregnant naturally and then eventually successfully through IVF. I had plenty of tests done for infertility and nothing abnormal was found (again) and it was classified under that good old fashioned term ‚Äúunexplained infertility‚Äù. Like we‚Äôre living in the 19th century where modern medicine isn‚Äôt a thing.

I am so privileged and eternally grateful and that I was able to get pregnant and deliver a healthy baby but the birth experience was also weird. Irregular contractions throughout, kept passing clots the size of tennis balls whilst I was labouring and I could tell from the midwives expressions it wasn‚Äôt normal. I had to have a blood transfusion afterwards. But in my debrief they couldn‚Äôt tell me what went wrong, what the clots were, why the contractions were never normal.

My pregnancy and labour notes were not digitalised, they were in a folder that I had to carry around with me to every medical scan or appointment (UK mums will know what I‚Äôm talking about). There is no centralised resource for my sexual health, no possible chance for them to cross reference my GP notes on my dysmenorrhoea with my infertility tests and finally my birth story and work out what‚Äôs going on. And this drives me MENTAL.

I am 28 now. I have been pregnant before, and terminated it. I have no regrets, no shame. I made the right decision. When I found out, I cried. I was terrified, and so so angry at myself for not being more careful. I was lucky, and eternally grateful, that the father was supportive of my choice, despite being easily the most abusive person I have ever had the displeasure of being with. That was one of the things he did right.

But I can't talk about it. I can't talk about my desire to never have kids, I can't even just mention it in passing. Why? Because that opens the door to other people's opinions, and absolutely nothing I say will get them to stop.

I get it. I'm good with kids. But why does that automatically have to mean that I should want them? Why does that automatically negate the fact that the entire time I'm interacting with them, I'm screaming on the inside?

I had my gynecologist appointment this morning and wanted to update y'all! 

So, I got to the gynecologist today and I had to see a doctor who isn't my normal. Overall, that experience wasn't great. She did everything a lot more hard and fast than my normal doctor was and it didn't make me feel the most comfortable. I lay down, I get in the stirrups and the first thing she says to me is, ""okay, so there is definitely something in here."" After 5 minutes of intense cramping and 3 different forceps (one to just hold my IUD in), she pulled out a MASSIVE (about penny sized but everything feels huge when it's in your body and you're freaked out I guess) wad of hair and blanket fuzz that was wrapped around my IUD strings. I have to go back in 3 weeks for an ultrasound to make sure that my IUD is in the right place, but everything feels okay for now.

I have some cramping still, is that normal? I experienced a lot of pain when they were digging around so I assumed that this was just the aftershock of that so to speak.

OK, so feel free to say that I'm crazy, but I just want to know if anyone else has experienced this.

So for the last year I've been working from home. My husband can't work due to chronic illness. 
We live in a 2-up, 2-down terrace (it's cosy and I love it, but there's not a lot of space), so for a year we've been together constantly. Sitting side by side on the sofa all day, every day. 

Anyway, the last few months or so I've noticed a weird pattern. In the week preceding my period, my husband (we'll call him N) will start to ""mirror"" my symptoms. He gets spots, is super hungry, and has proper full-on mood swings. 

For example, my period is due tomorrow (according to my tracker, and it definitely feels like it is). N has had a proper skin breakout this last week, constantly snacking and is feeling so irritable. What prompted me to post this was that N was playing a super laidback game on Xbox, and suddenly got incredibly annoyed when he couldn't complete a level. He turned it off, turned to me and said, ""I'm really sad and angry and I don't know why."" 
And all I could say was, ""yeah, me too. Sucks, doesn't it?"" 

And this is not the first time. Like I say, I really started to notice it a few months back. 

The thing is, if he was super involved with tracking my period, I'd say it was psychosomatic. But he's not. It comes as a surprise to him every month, basically. 
And I'm not regular as clockwork, either, ranging from 20 to 27 days or so. So it's not that he's subconsciously anticipating my cycle.

Or am I just being crazy?? Has anyone else experienced anything like this?

TLDR; it seems like my husband gets PMS along with me - has it happened to anyone else?

original post:


I just had a big cry fest at work and again in my car because I'm so confused and upset, so forgive me if this post is a mess.

I've been dealing with recurring yeast infections since I started hormonal birth control LAST OCTOBER and I genuinely don't know what I'm doing wrong... kinda just wanna throw the whole pussy out rn. just get rid of it. sex becomes painful after a while anyway so what's the fucking point.

used NuvaRing for about 4 months before calling it quits, and now I've been on Nikki for almost 3 and I'm still trying to deal with this. I'm so tired of feeling dirty. it's starting to really, really affect my self esteem and sex life. I'm going to make an appointment at a second gyno much closer to me for a second opinion on why the hell this keeps happening, but they're also a religious organization and I'm worried they'll just blame it 100% on the birth control and tell me to stick to condoms or abstinence until marriage, rather than help me come up with some kind of solution. like I understand they won't prescribe birth control because they don't agree with it morally but I'm so afraid of just getting written off... I just want to know why other people can take a pill and be fine and I have to have cottage cheese crotch every other weekend

um well if you made it this far props to you. I currently take renew life probiotics, change out of damp underwear or use a pantyliner if I can't change, I don't douche or put shit up there that doesn't belong, I don't know what else I have to do to just have a normal vagina and it's wrecking my self esteem.

okay thanks

x5nls7,Healthyhooha,1662299848.0,"So to start off, at first I would literally eat fast food every day, drink sugary boba teas at least 4-5 times a week, drank coffee every single day and ate absolutely no fruit. I was wondering why my vagina would smell so bad so I bought the Monistat feminine wash to help. I noticed the smell was better but the inside of my vagina still smelled. (like i would pee and it would be smelly and I would wonder why my vagina smells bad on the inside.)

&#x200B;

So I decided I would add some better foods into my diet not for my vagina at first but because I noticed my weight going up and it was affecting me mentally. I started off cutting down on fast food entirely. I'll still eat it maybe 2-3 times a week but very rare. Instead I now eat oven meals from my HEB store that has the prepackaged food with a protein carb and a vegetable. I also decided to buy popping boba from amazon and buy some diet green tea from Walmart with 0 sugar and drink boba drinks that way to cut down on bad sugar. I haven't drank coffee for 11 days now. I'll bring that back in gradually but not right away. Maybe like once-twice a week. 

Now the biggest help I feel has been adding fruit into my diet. Watermelon, strawberries and pineapple I feel have helped tremendously but mostly strawberries as I eat those daily with chocolate hummus. Along with peeing alot more due to the watermelon and strawberries, my pee no longer has a bad smell! I also havent used the Monistat fem wash for 11 days as well.

TW: HORRIFYING AND BLOODY

This was after my second ER visit had misdiagnosed me with a yeast infection and a UTI. I made my way back the next day when the issue had only gotten worse. Unbelievable labial swelling, I'm talking 5x its normal size, very painful and I was barely able to walk, totally out of it.

They finally have an OBGYN look at me after hours of waiting around, and the first thing she does is gasp, physically recoil, and say, ""Oh honey, that must hurt so bad."" I start bawling, and they end up deciding to drain it, which was the worst pain of my life. I screamed and bawled, and about four or five tablespoons worth of pus came out, and they're currently analyzing it in the lab figuring out what's causing the infection. There's another abcess they haven't touched yet, it's more internal, and a growth in one of my ovaries they say they might have to cut out, warning me that this could render me infertile. They said if I'd waited any longer I'd have been at risk of going septic.

If all goes well they're sending me home tomorrow with a home health plan, the day before my classes start. Not gonna lie, I still feel sore and kind of like death. I'm nauseous and in a good deal of pain, sore all over and I've got no energy at all, but I'm just glad it's being sorted out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/kyvij6/unhealthy_hooha_and_the_worst_possible_start_of_a/,Unhealthy hooha and the worst possible start of a New Year UPDATE,,133,23,0.99,sad-wendall

I love how engaged everyone is on this sub, we are an incredible community that come together to help all who come here for help but ureaplasma IMO is getting thrown out way too much.  I agree it is more prevalent than previously believed by the medical community and does **contribute** to the cause of other vulvo/vaginal issues but not all and certainly not as many as being suggested on this sub.

Please try to make sure that you are providng reliable and **sourceable** information so we are not contributing to the spread of poor info on the internet.

There is an enormous amount of things that can go wrong with the vulva/vestibule/vagina and when someone comes here asking for help with pain when urinating or upon penetration, or having ""unusual discharge"" with no other info provided, we need to dig for more info to properly help the sufferer narrow things down instead of jumping straight to ureaplasma.  

Even if the person gets tested and is positive, this may only be a portion of what is actually causing their sufferage and stopping at a diagnosis of ureaplasma will only delay their healing.  Many antibiotics have a side effect of anti-inflammation which makes you feel a lot better but then your issues start to return once the prescription leaves the body and this can cause a person to be frustrated all over again possibly losing faith and hope in turning to communities like this one for help.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/h9h8pi/its_not_always_ureaplasma/,It's not always ureaplasma,,132,18,0.96,Thelastunicorn80

112hc4i,Healthyhooha,1676411829.0,"I‚Äôve (37/f) been suffering from yeast infections for 3-4 months. There are multiple GPs at my GP practice and I usually get assigned to whoever is next available (we have a GP shortage in NZ) and for the last 3 visits they have all been male.

All they did was to ask about my symptoms and ordered me to take my own swabs and various tests (blood tests, smear, BV, STI were done by a nurse). One was quite hung up on the fact that despite having all other common yeast infection symptoms, my discharge (as least what I thought) was not necessarily ‚Äúcottage cheese‚Äù like. All the tests came back negative except candida. And all they were giving me was just clotrimazole and one-off Fluconazole.

The medication above do take care of the symptoms for a week but they always return a week or 2 later, just like clockwork. 

I have asked one of the male GPs if he can just take a look at my vagina to see what is going on down there but he didn‚Äôt think it was necessary. When I asked him to refer me to a gynecologist he almost laughed at my face and told me not to use tampons even though i had been using tampons for the last 20 years.

My partner said I should go to a female doctor because men don‚Äôt get it. At first I thought he was being ridiculous, but he brought up the fact that women often find male doctors dismissive. Three weeks ago when another episode of itchiness erupted, I called my clinic and asked for a female doctor. The wait was so much longer but I booked it anyway.
During this period my symptoms have come and gone and come back again after a round of clotrimazole. 

Today as soon as I met my new female GP I told her about the research I‚Äôve read on the New England Journal of Medicine on weekly Fluconazole for six months as recurring yeast infection treatment. She was happy to give it a go as long as another candida swab test comes back positive.

She performed a proper physical exam on my vagina and took the sample herself. She saw the discharge inside and said it does look like I have yeast infection. She noticed all the scratch marks on my vulva and understood how much I had suffered. 

In the meantime she prescribed me clotrimazole, promethazine and glycerol for temporary relief. She booked me in for another appointment three weeks from now to look at the results instead of telling me to ‚Äúcome back when you itch again (but by then the wait to see me will be 1.5 weeks)‚Äù

ky6vzf,Healthyhooha,1610753832.0,"Hey guys first of all for anyone suffering with their hooha I hear you it‚Äôs the most uncomfortable and awkward situation to be in !
I‚Äôve had recurrent yeast infections for 2 years  i never had normal discharge and constantly suffered with lesions, cuts and swelling . To see a gyno it took me a full year (crazy waiting lists here) and after two appointments they said they couldn‚Äôt help me and that maybe it was ‚Äònormal‚Äô for me - not helpful whatsoever and left me suffering .
I tried pessaries creams flucozone and vaginal probiotics and all the usual recommendations non bio washing detergent cotton knickers  etc but nothing worked longer than a few days what seems to have worked for the past month-

1. I went off birth control -I really think this was most of the problem. I had been taking it for several years and after a few weeks of a break things started to improve I also think my vagina started to self clean again as I had discharge for the first time in years .if you are really struggling try a break if you can.
2. Oral probiotics- for some reason these worked a lot better than the vaginal ones directly .I completely doubted their effectiveness and never bothered with them . I take rephresh or optibac for women and they are definitely worth a try too.
3. I don‚Äôt use any shower gel at all anymore and wash my hair separately .I use dove sensitive bar all over not just down there and I only gently rinse internal Labia with water . Also make sure it‚Äôs completely dry after shower gently pat !
4. If you‚Äôre in serious pain what helped was good quality toilet roll don‚Äôt wipe but pat and most off all use aquaphor regularly throughout the day and after showering /wiping  it helps so much with any irritation when nothing else would !
5.try give yourself a break from sex for a few weeks to allow for a recovery of skin.
6. Same goes for shaving -grow out that hair for as long as you can and let it do it‚Äôs natural protecting !
7. Sometimes vaginal irritation can be exacerbated by weak skin around the area. I started taking multivitamins too so may have contributed its worth adding to your routine 
8. Lastly I am convinced things got worse down there when I was stressed out so chilling out probably helps too easier said than done

8gtpq3,Healthyhooha,1525381019.0,"So I recently got a bidet off Amazon after thinking about it for a while. I lived with a roommate up until about a month ago and didn‚Äôt want to get one then because we shared a bathroom and she would have thought it was weird. Now, I initially thought it sounded horrible and weird...cold water spraying directly at my butt/hooha?? No way!

However, I‚Äôve had a chronic issue with hemorrhoids and hate using toilet paper. Even wipes can cause irritation for me. I also live alone now. So I finally got the bidet and installed it yesterday which was actually super easy to do on my own. Coincidentally, I also have a yeast infection right now (went to the dr today, doing my meds tonight so I‚Äôm fine) but I‚Äôm having intense soreness and itchiness down there. 

It took some determination/courage haha but I finally made myself sit down and turn the knob to turn on the spray and WOW! At first it shocked me but then I felt the most amazing relief when the cool water hit my vagina. Also, I can see how this thing gets you way cleaner after a #2 compared to toilet paper.  Not to mention how much TP you could save by using this. 

I have an IUD and don‚Äôt have periods much anymore, but a bidet would also be super helpful at those times too! And even after sex when you want to feel clean down there but don‚Äôt want to jump in the shower. I wonder if they might even reduce the risk of getting UTIs?

Anyway, I thought I would post about this here because I wanted to share how amazing I think these bidets are for not only cleanliness of the backend, but also the front end! If you think it sounds weird and gross, I promise it‚Äôs so much better than just TP.

I explored every antifungal pill and cream available, even experimented with the candida diet, but with no success. This ordeal strained my relationship with my partner, who also suffered from yeast infections after intercourse. The infections seemed to vanish briefly, only to return as stubbornly as ever. Despite visiting eight doctors and three trips to the ER, no one could offer a solution. 
After enduring this for two years, I was referred to an infectious disease specialist who conducted a swab test to identify the specific strain of yeast and its drug resistance. It was determined that I had Candida albicans, which was resistant to all antifungal treatments except for an IV infusion called micafungin.

I can even taste myself on him, and it‚Äôs fine.

About 2 weeks ago i posted about my pregnancy dilemma, with my daughters dad, On a different subred. I got some really good, honest advice and only a few days ago after thinking hard for those 2weeks, decided on abortion. Nothing has happened yet but a procedure will soon be in motion. And it was one of the Hardest decisions iv'e ever made and i am honestly scared to go through it even as an adult woman.  Now, all i see is Post after post, story after story, news announcement after news announcement about it all.

It feels so surreal. I am grateful that i was born and live here and have this choice but I also feel heartache for all the woman and little girls who are living that reality. I even feel guilty because i didn't want to make this choice but after some reflection i know it is for the best for me, for now. I wish i was in the position to care for a lil baba again. I already have 2 little girls, my relationship with the father isn't too good and financially/physically it would be a huge struggle.

I believe All woman and young girls Should have that choice because mistakes happen all the time. Woman/young girls get forced into sex and raped, and reproductive coersion is a real thing too. It's all very disheartening.  And i wish i wasn't in this position at this time right now.

ou22rt,Healthyhooha,1627579826.0,"After MONTHS of testing, doctors appointments, research, and tears, I finally have gotten some answers and I wanted to share my experience thus far in the hopes that maybe it'll help someone. I'm a 24 cishet female for background. I've only had sex once since April, so knew it wasn't a partner passing it back and forth. I take probiotics, only wear cotton underwear, use unscented laundry detergent, only use fragrance-free soap (don't let it near my vulva). 

April/May: Noticed typical YI symptoms (clumpy white discharge, itching, burning with peeing). I've had YI's before so I started treatment immediately

* Monistat 1-Day - didn't work
* Monistat 3-Day - didn't work
* PCP prescribed me 2 rounds of 3 doses of fluconazole - didn't work (just made me incredibly nauseous)
* During 2nd round of fluconazole, tried boric acid suppositories. Within 3 days symptoms disappeared
* Tested for YI, BV, trich - all negative
* YI symptoms come back, I believe triggered by lube. 
* 7 days of boric acid - symptoms clear

June

* YI symptoms come back. 14 days of boric acid - symptoms clear
* Tested for YI, BV, trich - all negative
* Test for GBS - results positive, but rare meaning most likely not cause
* Treat GBS with amoxicillin - no effect

Around this time, based on my own research and the symptoms, I begin to suspect ureaplasma

July

* I have PIV intercourse (w/ condom, no lube) - symptoms immediately come back
* 7/21: Tested for YI, BV, trich, chlamydia, gonorrhea, UTI - positive for YI and BV
* Currently treating YI with course of 3 doses fluconazole + 5 nights of metronizadole gel for BV
* after harassing both my OBGYN and PCP and getting pushback, manage to get a mycoplasma/ureaplasma test
* 7/29: test POSITIVE for ureaplasma
* today will begin treatment for ureaplasma with 10 days doxycycline, twice a day

Although it sucks that I have ureaplasma, I am so immensely relieved that I FINALLY have answers. I only was able to get a swab for mycoplasma/ureaplasma after annoying the hell out of both my OBGYN and PCP, but it was so worth it because now I have answers. Hoping the months of misery will finally end once I treat the ureaplasma.

I've had constant yeast infections for a year. They might not not be over, who knows. But it's been a month since the last one and I'm still treating it over time. I have learned so much during this time about hygiene and taking care of my vagina. It's a whole process of learning to love it and I'm learning to recognize that it's a form of communication since my infections are probably psychologicaly induced. It's my body telling me there's something wrong in my life and I need to work on it.

But I'm here today to share my relief with you. My vagina feels healthy. I never had bad hygiene, but I learned so much about how to clean it properly. It's clean. It has healthy discharge. It feels smooth and soft and inviting instead of disgusting. It smells nice and fresh (from the probiotics and high water intake).

x54l2v,Healthyhooha,1662238572.0,"Let me start off by saying this is going to be long so bear with me. 

This all started about a year & a half ago. I was experiencing a burning sensation during sex, which I had in the past from time to time, it would often just resolve itself (I have some trauma so I always thought that there might be a connection). This time, however, it didn't. 

This progressed to being so painful, I couldn't be penetrated whatsoever. At this point I had tried treating myself with over the counter BV medication, which didn't help. 
I started occasionally getting itchy around the entrance of my vagina & my labia minora. I then tried otc yeast infection medication. Everything was pretty irritated so I waited a week before I tried another round of BV medication when I noticed it didn't go away, then took another round of YI meds. 

After none of these worked, I went to see my family doctor/PCP. I thought maybe it was BV again because, I had just taken YI medication & it wasn't helping. I also find that my BV and YI symptoms present virtually the same, so I usually need medical intervention to determine the cause if I can't figure it out on my own. (I've always had heavier, thick discharge from birth control, & don't have excessive watery discharge with an odor even when I'm BV+)
She noticed that my vulva & my groin looked red and irritated, and she suspected yeast. She did a PCR that came back positive for BV, so I was prescribed antibiotics. 

The itching seemed to have subsided at this point but the pain and burning was still there. I figured I just needed to let my skin do its thing & heal, it was irritated for so long, after all. Boy was I wrong. 

September 2021 rolled around.The itching became constant, severe & I could not find relief whatsoever. Luckily, I had a long overdue PAP scheduled (these types of examinations were put on the backburner for clinics because of lock downs province-wide). During the procedure she said that it looked like yeast & gave me a prescription for YI medication. 

But surprise!! It didn't work. Again. I went back, she gave me a different oral medication, which ALSO didn't work. She then tried me with the same medication one more time, but a longer course, for 2 wks. I gave it another week before I decided to make an appointment to let my skin settle. This led me into to December. 

Over Christmas holidays I experienced searing, burning pain & relentless itching and irritation. It was the most intense I had ever felt in my life. I booked an appointment for another examination. She said that, again, it looked like yeast. And if it came back positive I may need to go on a month long course of anti fungal meds. My doctor did a PCR to check for BV & yeast. BOTH came back negative. 

My family doctor was on maternity leave by the time the results came back. The doctor that's been filling in for her suspected it was hormonal. We switched my birth control 2 times with no improvement. She suggested a third and I told her I wanted to go off it completely to see if things would level out on their own. No change. 

Finally, in February,¬† she put me on a waitlist for a biopsy with a Gynecologist and prescribed me clobetasol because she suspected a lichen disorder but needed a biopsy to confirm. There's a long wait here in Canada so she began lichen treatment until the appointment. The skin was so irritated that it was peeling off. I stayed on clobetasol for 6 months, taking it once a day which became less and less effective.
This brings me to yesterday, the day of my appointment. 

After the intake assessment with the nurse, the Gynecologist did an examination with a speculum. She took one look at me and said ""I know your doctor ruled out infection, but you definitely have a severe yeast infection. It's so invasive that it's spread to the surrounding tissues and has infected your skin"" I was shocked. That couldn't be possible, could it??? My last PCR was negative for yeast. 

I have two possible theories:
1 - the PCR didn't test for every type of yeast and I had a different strain. 

2 - I took so many oral YI meds, but didn't treat it topically to the surrounding tissues and skin in my groin, perineum, etc. So even though they swabbed me, my discharge was clear, but everything else was not. So I got reinfected internally when it spread back inside of me after treatment. 

I think it could be a combination of both.
My Gynecologist asked me if I was diabetic or immunocompromised, because this kind of YI isn't typical of healthy people. HOWEVER, the combination of OTC BV and RX BV meds and also the multiple courses of antibiotics for wisdom teeth abcesses in the last year or 2 messed me up - BAD. So much so that I must have never recovered. I also definitely had BV and a YI at the same time at one point. 

My gyne prescribed me two medications, and to take a baking soda sitz bath before I applied them: terconazole internally and a compound cream of nyaderm and hyderm to the skin infection. She told me this will take a lot of work, and even after this 10 day course, I will probably not feel any better but it's a start! I'll have a follow up in 2 weeks time.

I had first orgasmed in elementary school with my shower head before I even knew what I was feeling, and I did it a lot. I am now 25.


There‚Äôs no way I could ever orgasm all the way with just a hand, even my own, or oral or grinding or anything. I figured I‚Äôd just have to deal with it and never talk to my husband it, but I gathered up the balls to suggest using a vibrator and he was pretty supportive about it. We have tried using the vibrator twice now and I still haven‚Äôt orgasmed with him. It‚Äôs even hard to do it on my own sometimes and bringing in another person is just not what I‚Äôm used to. But I want nothing more than to be able to do it with him only and never on my own again. I‚Äôve only ever been with him and we‚Äôve been having sex for nearly 9 years. But even with recently implementing him using the vibrator on me, I still can‚Äôt :( idk if it‚Äôs just all in my head and is new, or if I have extra skin/‚Äúclitoral hood‚Äù covering my clitoris (called clitoral phimosis) and that‚Äôs why It‚Äôs never been easy for me... TMI but I try to look and see if I can see my clitoris but I just don‚Äôt know if I can or what I‚Äôm really looking for. I‚Äôm going to the gyno next week to talk about birth control so I may bring it up... I just feel like a sexual failure. I love my husband so much and I want to give him this part of me, I‚Äôm just very discouraged. 


I hear about my friends being able to orgasm with their partners without sex toys and my mind is just blown because that never even remotely seemed like a possibility for me. My husband suggested not using the vibrator on my own for a few weeks and we will try again. Is it desensitized because I‚Äôve been using hard pressure my whole life? Am I just mentally not in a right place to orgasm using a vibrator with my husband yet? Is it possible I have too much skin covering the clitoris?? obviously no one will know the actual answer, but does anyone know of a situation like it? Do you know of anyone who had a clitoral hood reduction?

jmjnyk,WomensHealth,1604304548.0,"Hi everybody, I am the girl who went from worrying about her ovary being dead to finding out that she had ovarian cancer. So, I have somenew developments that I would like to share...more specifically, something that is most likely the cause of my cancer. 

So as I may have mentioned in previous posts, ovarian cancer tends to be extremely rare in those who are still in their childbearing years. It was to the extent that, as soon as I (26F) was informed of my diagnosis, I was sent to give blood samples for genetic testing. There are genetic mutations that enhance the risk for ovarian cancer drastically, the BRCA mutations being among them. However, cancer of any kind in my known bloodline is completely unheard of, so until the test results came back it was to be assumed that I simply hit a stroke of sheer awful luck. 

Well, I got the results at my appointment on Friday. I somehow not only have the BRCA1 mutation, but I also have the RAD50 mutation. Going off the paperwork I was given, the BRCA1 mutation bumps the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer from 2% to anywhere from 16-59%. so...we are fairly certain this is the cause of my cancer. 

However, that is not the end of it...it seems that the BRCA1 mutation also bumps the lifetime risk of breast cancer from 13% to anywhere from 40-87%. Not only that, but the RAD50 mutation also causes an enhanced risk of breast cancer, though there is not enough research to say how much just yet. 

Bottom line; I am very, very high-risk...

The plan is that in December, I will be meeting with some high-risk breast cancer specialists to get a better idea of what my options are. The doctor mentioned that on top of extra screening, if I am not willing to go through a mastectomy there are medications I can take to help decrease my chances. On top of that, there is a medicine he has high hopes for called ""parp inhibitors"" that may help me, though we don't know for sure until I meet with the specialists. Either way, I can't start these medications until my cancer treatment is finished. 

The majority of my close blood-family is likely going to get tested as well, and apparently it may be free due to me being found to have these mutations. It will likely start with my mother since she is the only bio-parent who would be civil enough to cooperate from the get-go, then my brothers. Should they wind up testing negative, I have an estranged paternal half-sister as well; it will be awkward as hell to contact her mother after several years, but I will be damned if this girl has to find out about these gene mutations the way I had to, or worse. Nobody deserves that...the only who is definitely not getting the test is my father, as he is technically my father in every aspect besides blood, and isn't linked to the apparent mess that is my genetic code. 

Its just...wow...what the hell is even happening here? Its really hard to wrap my head around all of this, so soon...I am not even really sad about the test results anymore; just shocked more than anything else. A year ago, I would have never, ever expected this; I have always been perfectly healthy until now...life is crazy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jmjnyk/whelp_that_explains_it/,"Whelp, that explains it.",,130,15,1.0,SubstantialDrawing7

just today, he was telling the class that women are most fertile at around 16 to 24 years of age. he then proceeded to tell us that as girls, we should get married early, because *of course* our main purpose in life is to produce babies. i brushed it off as just some advice for people who might be interested in starting families, although it was very weird. a boy then told him that he wanted to get married at the age of 29, and the teacher said that he wasn't interested in the boys because they would never 'expire'.

at this point i was reasonably angry i think, and i just left the class through the back door. when i came back, i asked my friends if i missed anything, and they told me that he approached them (we were divided into teams) and asked them when they wanted to get married, and stated that married women are generally happier and more successful than unmarried women (also including a comment saying 'look at the unmarried teachers and married teachers in our school. you see a difference right?') ???

i normally tolerate these discussions of his, but i just felt like i needed to exit the classroom today. i do feel like i was overreacting because most of my classmates didn't think it was that big of a deal. idk

zgeflh,WomensHealth,1670539441.0,"Hey,

So I posted on here a few weeks ago - sorry, don't know how to add the link!

A couple of weeks after the doctors found a mass on my ovary the pain came back much quicker and worse than before.  I had walked to the chemist to get a prescription for my daughter and on the way back the same pain as before started except this time I was on my knees unable to stand within 5 mins of getting home.  Went to the gynaecology ward at the hospital where they admitted me.  Everyone was amazing again, they gave me pain medication and the next day the surgeon came to see me and said they would be doing emergency surgery to remove the mass.

They did the surgery and when I woke up they explained they removed the mass along with an ovary and fallopian tube and also my appendix.  The mass had ruptured and this what what bought on the pain.  

It's been 3 weeks since then and I got my biopsy results back today.  They've said I have mucinous ovarian cancer, they think they caught it early, I need to go back in, in January for a full hysterectomy and following the pathology from that they'll know what stage the cancer is.  It's a rare type of ovarian cancer but has a better success rate if caught early so fingers crossed!

So basically again - don't brush off your pain, go and get it checked out. I know I've been lucky with my experience as my doctors were attentive and listened and I know this isn't always the case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/zgeflh/update_got_my_diagnosis/,UPDATE - Got my diagnosis,Support/Personal Experience ,127,11,0.99,subtlethrone123

ojunsm,Healthyhooha,1626228995.0,"As I‚Äôve been reading through various Reddit posts, I agree that there really ain‚Äôt an incredible amount of information about Bartholin cysts‚Äî particularly on goggle and whatnot so I thought I‚Äôd share my experiences to help with expanding the knowledge.

My history with Bartholin Cysts: 
I‚Äôve been getting them on and off for about the last 5-6 year and had around 20+ total. I‚Äôve been treated medically twice‚Äî the first one and the one I‚Äôm recovering from right at this moment. 

First one:
This one swelled up to about the size of a baseball and was so excruciatingly painful Incant even begin to describe it. I got in on one or two days notice with an GYN and it literally burst in the waiting room as I was waiting for my appointment. Not knowing what it was, I did nothing to treat it before the appointment and they basically just squeezed the rest of the puss out. There was so much I had to have new clothes brought to me so I could leave the office. The pain immediately subsided though and I wore a light pad for a few days and it drained a bit more 

Cysts 2-5
I had 4 more cysts that same summer. knowing what they now were, I soaked in the bath a lot and they all managed to burst. I worked very little that summer and was extremely annoyed and frustrated. 

Cysts 5-20ish
These have happened occasionally over the last 5 years. After having so many, I‚Äôve now found phoebes cure, as well as some other tricks. Very regular warm sits baths, black tea bags, with hazel and castor oil, prid drawing salve, apple cider vinegar, silica/tumeric/black pepper pills. 

All these worked for me in some fashion and all these cysts burst on their own. Do them combined and you have a real solid Arsenal. The worst news though is unfortunately it takes time for them to burst and if you don‚Äôt have a flexible workplace/can‚Äôt work from home/take time off you‚Äôre going to be extremely uncomfortable and your employer is a dick. 

Cyst 21ish
I used my normal arsenal of tricks but I left one out of the above list because so highly do not recommend it. Tree tree oil should not be used and I‚Äôve seen it suggested many times. If not diluted correctly, you can get a ‚Äúchemical burn‚Äù on tour skin down there. I now know this from experience. My cyst did burst, but I was left bed ridden for almost a month and had to go to urgent care when the burns from tea tree oil caused an infection on my skin down there. Please, for the love of god.. do not use tea tree oil. If you do, dilute it aggressively and god speed

Cyst 22 (Now) 
I am now working in a much less flexible work environment and am also 600 miles from my regular GYN. My cyst showed up again, causing me to go to the ER because I don‚Äôt have the ability to spend a week and a half nursing it until it pops. The ER drained and inserted a word catheter and I am about 36-hours post insertion. It hurts. Walking sucks, sitting-just dont, underwear is a definite no, and I‚Äôm hoping I dont have to poop anytime soon. Finding a GYN to take a new patient to remove it is a nightmare. But that can easily be avoided if you don‚Äôt travel/actually have a GYN. 

As for the remainder of recovery and removal, I can it speak to that yet, but I hope that the word catheter is a solution to a recurring problem‚Äîalthough I‚Äôve read many times that it‚Äôs not. 

Where do mine come from:
If doctors tell you they‚Äôre caused by STDs I personally think they‚Äôre full of shit. After this many, I‚Äôve narrowed mine down to every time I wear shorts and most recently now when I wear jeans. Tight fitting clothes is my kryptonite. This most recent cyst was my first due to wearing jeans but in my defense.. because of Covid I‚Äôve worn nothing but leggings and pajamas for the last year and a half and prior to that jeans were not a problem. 

I‚Äôm disappointed with the lack of information on the internet and the lack of interest by our medical community to find solutions to a problem that exists for so many women. It‚Äôs enraging that it‚Äôs not a priority.. but I think we all know why (it‚Äôs not a condition that men have to deal with and it certainly isn‚Äôt life threatening enough to care). 

I feel for all women on here and other threads desperately seeking information and I hope you don‚Äôt ever get as many as I‚Äôve had.  Or any at all for that matter.

l1s6qd,WomensHealth,1611208045.0,"Hi, everyone. I am that girl who went from wondering if her ovary was dead to finding out that she got ovarian cancer through some...less than desirable surprise genetics. So...I have some updates, and thankfully the news is nowhere near as bad as most of what I have shared on reddit throughout the second half of 2020.

Thankfully, the rest of my family has been able to remain together. It has been hard losing my mother, but we are hanging in there on that front. There was a pretty big scare on Christmas Eve where our dog broke out of the house and was gone for 6 hours. We were terrified; she usually opens the front door on her own to get out, but she never wanders off very far, and always comes back after she spends time in the yard. A storm with some really strong winds hit after she got lost, so the poor thing was caught in it. She has the shiniest black coat, too, so we were terrified she would be nearly invisible to drivers. We searched the entire town and were trying to prepare for the worst after all that had happened so far...we started crying together when she showed up at the door soaking wet and shaking after midnight. We found out later that one of the neighbors were shooting off fireworks while she was out, and the loud noises must have really terrified her, and coupled with the storm...well, we gave the poor baby plenty of love and treats. The next day, we were grinning through Christmas morning, because we were just so happy to still have her.


My lungs are doing much better, as well! The last couple of pulmonologist appointments have shown that the leftover fluid is decreasing, so the doctor is saying that while the pleural effusion was not technically due to the cancer spreading to my lungs, the cause was still likely a symptom of the cancer. As a result, the chemotherapy has been shrinking the last of the extra fluid. The doctors can't hear any problems when they listen to my lungs, and outside of some chest wall pain during my chemo crash, my chest has been feeling great! I will never take breathing for granted again. 

As for my cancer, my oncologist has noted that she is feeling great about how things are coming along now thay the pleural effusion has shrunk, and she is really optimistic about the possibility of the next chemotherapy being my last. They told me that after my sixth cycle, they will send me in for another CAT scan to be sure. That scan will tell whether or not I have finally hit remission. So far, I am hoping for the best! 

That said...the next stop will be to finish the job on my hysterectomy. Since the cancer progressed so much, I was told that my best chance of keeping it from returning is to take the remaining ovary, fallopian tube, and uterus out. On top of that, we found that based on the type of tumor, replacement estrogen and HRT will not be safe for me. So...menopause is hitting me early after all. Not looking forward to that...I am also anxious about what the lack of estrogen could do to me. I have heard about health risks, and while there is medication for it, I am pretty worried about the possibilities. 

But there is one thing that I am pretty excited for. The chemo caused the majority of my hair to fall out, but I haven't had it in me to shave what's left...I will be blunt for the Tolkien fans here, I look like I am about to go search for my precious. But a couple of days ago, I was looking in the mirror and under those scraggly hairs, I saw it. I saw that my head is covered in peachfuzz! My head feels fuzzy now...I heard it can start coming back before treatment ends, but I didn't want to get my hopes up about it. I know it will still be a good while, but this gives me hope and relief...maybe with time, I won't be so different from what I used to be. 

So this is where I am now. I want to say thank you to everybody who has offered me their words of support, as it means so much...I'm looking forward to getting stronger and stronger. I do have questions though...if anybody who is reading this has gone through surgical menopause, would you be willing to share your experience on how it went? Does it end at some point, and how bad is it? Are the long-term health risks involved with being cut off from estrogen young something I should be really worried about, even with medication to control it?

I am currently sitting in the emergency room awaiting transfer to a hospital to get emergency surgery (not sure what surgery yet...) because of a misplaced IUD and a swollen ovary that is bleeding. Swollen ovaries have the potential to flop over and twist and could cut off blood flow and die. Woo hoo. 

I came to the ER because, 1 month after having my IUD placed, I started pouring out blood. Literally dripping blood everywhere. I got lucky with a very thorough doctor. He did a pelvic exam, took swabs and samples of everything. I got 2 ultrasounds, one of my pelvis and one of my vagina. I would not have found out I could lose an ovary and potentially die had I not been like ""hmm thats not right.""

If something is wrong or out of the ordinary, you need to call a doctor. Telehealth is becoming increasingly available. Use it!

hipqmr,WomensHealth,1593531667.0,"Here are some things I've learned along the way (feel free to add more in the comments!):

**LOGISTICS**

* Before having sex with a partner, make sure to both get **STD testing** even if you are both virgins. Some STDs are transmitted from mother to child. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. It's also more comfortable to say ""hey I'm getting STD testing soon, you should too so we don't have to worry about it later."" It sounds less like an accusation and more like a mutual collaboration to keep both of you safe and healthy.
   * If he refuses even after attempting to educate him on why it's important, dump/block him. No sex is worth that risk.
* Also make sure to discuss birth control. Is he going to wear a condom? Are either of you allergic to latex? Are you using hormonal birth control or an IUD? Is that not necessary because you'll only be doing hand and/or mouth stuff or you're both women?  (I promise this is better to discuss DAYS before the act to save you from extra awkwardness when you realize you can't safely have sex, or make you risk it and have unsafe sex). You'll also be able to focus on JUST the sex when the time comes because you won't be worrying about logistics the whole time.
   * This should go without saying, but if you are not on birth control/can't get on birth control and he won't wear a condom, reconsider the relationship. Don't make any decisions that would put you at risk, no guy is worth that, especially if he's the one trying to put you in a risky or harmful situation.
* If this is a long term male partner you are going to have sex with, have an **""accident"" plan**. What will you want to do if you accidentally get pregnant? What would he want to do? It's obviously ultimately your decision, but knowing if he would support you and a child or not can help you make that decision easier, and can even help you decide if he's a good partner for you.
   * It's a red flag if he answers with ""whatever you want to do,"" that's a cop out. It's neither owning up to the responsibility of his actions nor expressing his valid desire to not have children right now. You'll essentially be on your own if an accident happened with a guy like that, he'll flake no matter what decision you make and won't support you 100%. However, this kind of guy might be good if you like to be the one to always control situations and take the reigns, each to their own.
* You will want to take a pregnancy test AT SOME POINT while being sexually active, so save yourself the stress and buy a couple ahead of time (they stay good for a long time). **Dollar store pregnancy tests work just as good as the expensive ones!!!**
* Don't be afraid to take Plan B if something goes wrong (condom broke, forgot to take pill, etc). It's best to take it within 3 days of the woopsie. edit: plan b works by preventing ovulation, it does NOT affect an already-fertilized egg, so it won't help if you've recently ovulated. This is why tracking fertility is so important for not just TTC women!!!
* If you have a regular cycle, track it with an app like Clue or Flo. It'll let you know when you're fertile so you can know to avoid sex during that time window or be extra careful (or go extra crazy if you're trying to conceive).

&#x200B;

**THE DEED**

* Even if you are naturally lubricated enough, you're going to eventually need lube at some point and that is totally okay. Sometimes you are extra dehydrated or things are just a little off hormonally. Make sure the lube you use is safe to use with condoms and won't cause an allergic reaction for either of you. **ONLY USE WATER-BASED LUBE IF YOU ARE USING CONDOMS.**
* Before having sex (in general) it's a good idea to get to know your body through masturbating. It'll help you get more comfortable and figure out what you like. This tip is for **everyone: the more stimulation you use during masturbation (vibrator on the highest setting, gripping dick too tightly, etc) the more desensitized you'll be. Being able to orgasm during masturbation with as little stimulation as possible (just fingers, low vibrator setting, etc) will make orgasming during sex easier.**  My male partner and I both had this issue going into our relationship and it took a little while for sex to be more enjoyable than masturbation.
* **If you feel too tight to comfortably have penetrative sex, try pushing out like you're peeing. It relaxes the vaginal muscles (this is one of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard and has saved my life MANY times).**
* Doing kegels and strengthening your vaginal and pelvic floor muscles makes sex much more enjoyable for both parties ;) (for me and my partner, at least).
* Water is **not** great lube. Make sure to be naturally lubricated enough during shower sex.
* **COMMUNICATE**. Say you like it when he does something that feels good or ask him to do something you know you already enjoy. Make sure to ask if he enjoys what you're doing or if there is anything he would like you to do. It's also **MORE** than okay to ask to slow things down or stop. Sometimes you need a breather or an emotional break for a minute, or to stop altogether. It's also okay to compromise, for example, if he wants to have sex but you don't, and you're comfortable giving him a handjob, offer that instead. Or maybe you don't want to have sex but you're okay with getting fingered, I think you get the idea.
* If you can get yourself off but he can't, it's okay to do it yourself during sex (like clit stimulation while you're having penetrative sex). That way you both can have a good time. Most women can't orgasm from penetrative sex alone, so getting a little extra help from your hand or a toy is great and can be enjoyable for both parties.
* Don't be afraid of period sex! Obviously most of us probably aren't even thinking about sex while we're curled up in bed with cramps and rampant emotions, but if you feel good on your light days and ur dude isn't afraid of blood put a towel down and go crazy. My man personally loves it because as he says, I'm ""extra lubed up."" Make sure to clean up beforehand and after with a wet wipe or a shower.
* If you have trouble getting turned on or just don't feel in the mood a lot, work on being physical with ur partner in other ways first. Massages, back rubs, hair petting, spooning, wrestling and play fighting are all great, and you might even find yourself ready for some action after some of them. Also **DON'T FORGET FOREPLAY**. Guys tend to not need a lot of foreplay and can go straight to smashing, but for us ladies it's incredibly important for getting physically and mentally turned on. Don't let him try to skip foreplay unless you are a magical being who doesn't require it.
* This is more of a relationship thing, but **try to make sex just about each other** (unless ur poly or in an open relationship or smthn). If you are going to masturbate, have your partner send you nudes instead of watching porn, and try to get him to do the same. Obviously sometimes a little alone time is needed, but when you can, make sure to orient sexual thoughts and actions with each other, it's very good for strengthening your relationship. **THIS IS JUST A PERSONAL SUGGESTION, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT UNLESS YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND WANT TO TRY IT**
   * I'm currently with a male partner who does not watch porn (surprising, I know) and let me tell you, being the source of all of his sexual desires and satisfaction makes me feel very special, and I know he feels the same way since I also don't watch porn. It has also made sex so much better than any previous relationship I've been in (where we both watched porn alone). Maybe it's some biological thing, who knows. Just because it's good for us doesn't mean it'll be good for your relationship, but if you like the sound of it give it a try!
* For the love of god have a towel or tissues in the room beforehand.
* edit: pee after sex!!! it helps prevent UTIs

gdk098,Healthyhooha,1588625859.0,"So I went to my annual exam with a new gynecologist May of last year and everything went well, however she recommended me an intimate soap. I was kinda confused about it because we all know the ‚Äòvaginas are self-cleaning thing‚Äô but I went with it. I used it on my vulva and outer labia and I started to develop excess amount of white discharge. Because I was taking a bunch of pills for acne I didn‚Äôt question it but I was worried I was developing yeast. It made me really insecure and sex had to be planned because I was obsessed with cleaning myself. Well, I started to come off the medications yet the discharge seemed off still. I decided that I would order boric acid and do the treatment. While I waited for the delivery I decided to just wash myself with water taking advantage that I was doing quarantine without my SO. Lo and behold my discharge went from white clumps to very small quantities of transparent liquid, same with smell/taste. Now I‚Äôm so mad I pretty much went with what my gynecologist was saying for almost a year when it affected me so much. And I just don‚Äôt get why would she even suggest it since I wash everyday, sometimes multiple times and never had problems with smell or other symptoms.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/gdk098/why_would_my_gynecologist_recommend_me_a_soap/,Why would my gynecologist recommend me a soap?,Hygiene üßº,129,73,0.94,m14angelica
g9zupn,WomensHealth,1588122393.0,"PLEASE take a test if you think you might be pregnant. Maybe even two if you want. I promise it's more reliable than anything we're going to tell you on here. You can find them at all drug stores, target, walmart, and even order them online. If none of these are an option for you or have limited access, ask your partner/dude you're bangin or even a trusted friend to get you a pack (they usually come in a pack of 2). It's totally normal to stock up on tests and just have them around for situations like this. They're relatively inexpensive for the relief they'll give you (or give you enough time to decide what to do in the small chance you actually are preggers). 

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use protection always if you REALLY don't want to get pregnant. Condoms obviously don't feel as good but having an unwanted pregnancy is gonna feel even worse and won't be worth it (unless you want kids rn, but that doesn't seem to be a common theme in these kind of posts). 

Stress, increase/decrease in physical activity, diet and lifestyle changes can delay your period or make you skip it altogether, **just because it's late doesn't mean you're necessarily pregnant**. You can also still get PMS symptoms during the time your period is delayed, which are all pretty similar to early pregnancy symptoms. 

Remember, if your cycle is regular you can always calculate when you were last fertile (or when you would have been if you're on hormonal BC) by finding your ovulation day and adding a safety net of around 4-5 days before ovulation day and 2 days after. Clue and Flo are great apps for this if you want to be aware of your fertility and are not on hormonal BC or don't have access. If you didn't have sex around this week-long window, the chances you are pregnant are SIGNIFICANTLY lower than if you had sex during it. Flo lets you put in your temperature every day so you can know when you ovulate every month so you can use extra protection or abstain for a while around that time. **But, there's still a chance for pregnancy no matter what because our bodies don't seem to always follow the rules.** So like I said, if your period is late and you think there's a chance you might be pregnant **TAKE A TEST.** If your period is abnormal, these apps can still help with getting a sense of what certain signs can mean in terms of where you are in your wack cycle (like maybe you have very specific PMS symptoms which foretell a period coming in a couple days, on ovulation day you feel different, etc). I started using Clue when my cycle was extremely irregular and it helped me learn about my body so much, I would highly recommend. Now my period is very regular and I switched to Flo because it's a lot more detailed with the symptoms you can log, I would also highly recommend.

So yesterday I went to see my OBGYN due to how much discharge I had been having.  Since it was clear I didn‚Äôt think it was anything serious (it was a mild yeast infection and I got medicine for it). While there I was told I was due for my pap and I also wanted to discuss getting back on birth control since I‚Äôm casually dating and want to be safe in case anything happens. 


Please keep in mind that I‚Äôve had an IUD put in me twice before so I knew it was going to be painful. What I was NOT expecting was for it to be so painful that I PASSED OUT!!! I woke up not knowing where I was at or who the assistant in the room was and I started crying!! It was one of the most embarrassing moments ever. Plus I had never passed out before so I had no idea what the hell was going on.

You know how basically everything has someone influencing in it? So influencers in my country have a loooot to say about vaginal ""health"" and ""hygiene."" A couple of wild things that come to mind:

2. Warm milk and cinnamon for (I'm assuming) increased lubrication during sex
3. Pineapples for... well, yeah.

So the latest thing I've seen going around the internet is ""post-period hygiene.""

Now I have to make sure I take my birth control regularly and on time without missing a day or I will start bleeding right away. My periods have gotten better but the cramps are intense. I lost my virginity at 21. With that same partner I was constantly having yeast infections and BV that never seemed to fully go away. Thinking back I think he might have also been getting yeast infections and it was being passed back n forth. I also got HPV from this partner. Which has not cleared and continued to now be the high risk HPV. I get yearly Pap smears and colposcopies. Which I found out that my cervix is a lot more sensitive than others and that when getting biopsies it takes a lot to stop the bleeding. I am now 25 and with a new partner for over a year. I am still suffering from yeast infections/BV. I am also noticing that I will get thrush if my yeast infection is really bad. So I am assuming I overall have a Candida overgrowth.

gl3e4a,WomensHealth,1589666852.0,"Before you get the wrong idea, I‚Äôm not a part of any hipster cult or weird nudist colony. I would consider myself to be a very average, married, vanilla mid-twenties female. I‚Äôm very new to yoga but I‚Äôm curious to how far I can push my body. And like many women I, too, have body image issues. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5‚Äù, 170 lbs, and a little thick around the middle. I know I‚Äôm not fat, but I‚Äôm not skinny either. I‚Äôve noticed the changes my body has endured since I‚Äôve become an adult, and some of those are harder to accept than others. There are stretch marks and jiggly parts, scars and blemishes. I so badly want to accept those things, but it seemed I wasn‚Äôt taking the correct steps for it. 

Rewind back about 5 years ago. I got to the point where I was obsessed with my weight. The number on the scale, specifically. I was weighing myself multiple times a day, counting calories, and recording it all. I did see results from it, but that process took a much greater role on my mental health than the good it was doing. I decided to ditch the scale. I haven‚Äôt owned one since and only weigh myself at the doctors office and I find myself surprised at how low my weight is every time. Not that it‚Äôs a significant amount less than I would think, but it reels me back into the reality that I‚Äôm not a huge, enormous cow like I see myself in the mirror. 

The mirror. Here arises the next issue. I‚Äôm a comparer. The older I get, the more I find myself pinching, squeezing, and repositioning my body in the mirror every day. Wishing my boobs were perkier, my thighs touched less, and my muffin top a little less muffin-y. I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs consumed me so much lately, but again I became obsessed with my body‚Äôs imperfections and I‚Äôve even noticed a change in mine and my husbands relationship because of it. It‚Äôs hard to let someone else love you when you don‚Äôt love yourself. 

I‚Äôve been trying to find ways of acceptance and self love through gentle meditation and prayer, but I was still struggling. I‚Äôm working to become more disciplined in my yoga practice due to my extra time at home now (thanks COVID) and have really been trying to focus on the strength my body gives me instead of its physical image during the actual practice. I don‚Äôt know about you, but this has been crazy difficult for me. I‚Äôve always been a believer in facing my problems head on, and today I did just that. I did a little research on the idea behind naked yoga (totally blushing) and decided to really come face to face with my problems. So I got naked. 

I closed all the blinds and locked all the doors. This was to be for me and no one else. I didn‚Äôt even tell my husband I did it, hence why I‚Äôm venting to reddit. But I made it through a pretty intense (for me) practice and by the time I made it to savasana at the end, I laid there with tears in my eyes. For the first time in my life, I was able to accept and love and be proud of my body for what it had done, and during my short meditation I prayed a thankful prayer for my strong, imperfect body. 

Did this solve my self-image issues? Not even close. There were still pinches during certain poses from the extra love I have and it took some serious mental focus to get myself away from those thoughts. It‚Äôs going to take lots of work and a lot less criticism in the mirror to get to a good state and stay there, but I felt it today. I found the peace with myself, physically and mentally. Now, if you read this far, thank you. If this helps one person find that same love for themselves as I got a glimpse of today, then this terribly long post was worth it.

I am a 28 year old female, and I‚Äôm engaged to be married 
We just had sex for the first time. We were both virgins.
We‚Äôve been together for 4 years and we both decided we  wanted to wait until we were atleast engaged.
We are both very connected emotionally and intellectually,
And we are both very sexually attracted to one another. 

The sex wasn‚Äôt majorly painful, but even after I was wet, it was really uncomfortable and tender inside after we were going for while,
Especially in the missionary position, which felt like my cervix was being poked or something, and like my urethra was being rubbed raw. 
I‚Äôm very short, 4‚Äô11, so I don‚Äôt know if that has to do with anything. 
It felt a little better when I was on top.

He was very gentle, and made sure I was comfortable and enjoying it, and was very attentive and listened to me when it was getting uncomfortable. 

I did eventually orgasm, but we had to stop and try something else for him, because it was getting uncomfortable down there. 

I wasn‚Äôt ever taught much about sex, and that‚Äôs really embarrassing to say since I‚Äôm 28. I‚Äôve looked up things about it over the years on google, but after having sex I realized how unprepared I really was for the physical aspect of it.

So I get into the room and she tells me to takeoff my shirt and bra and said that she won‚Äôt be giving me a gown because it gets in the way. I have never ever had this happen before and it made me feel really uncomfortable standing there in the room with my hands covering my breasts until it was time to step over to the machine. It just felt weird not having a gown on. Maybe I‚Äôm over reacting but it just made me really uncomfortable and I‚Äôm confused as to why she would say the gown would get in the way?   Am I over reacting? Has this happened to anyone else?

vaeeeg,Healthyhooha,1655008745.0,"I want all my women, men, & anyone in between to know about ureaplasma. It is not widely taught, however it absolutely should be. This is a parasite that is passed through sexual intercourse, but not considered an std in the US (even tho it is and is listed as an STD in other nations). Most of the time you can have this without knowing, but as it progresses you can often times get symptoms. This is a fairly new infection we have found within the last 5-10 years which we couldn‚Äôt previously see because its SO small, often causes no issues, and we didnt have the tech to find it before. It can cause different types of discharge colors and strong odors and pain in the urinary track/ vagina. (Everyone has different symptoms) This can cause infertility problems in both men and women! A lot of women who have had ‚Äúrandom‚Äù infertility problems actually have had ureaplasma that caused damage. Its resistant against some antibiotics, but doxycycline can usually treat it. Ask your dr for alternatives if youre allergic. I had it for years without knowing. I strongly urge everyone who is sexually active to ask your dr to specifically check for this (as they usually only check for it upon request) because it can cause PID and damage. It can cause damage to mens reproductive health as well. If you have a partner id highly suggest letting them know to get treated too if you have it because if you have sex with them again after getting it treated, often times you can get it again. Please look it up and learn about it, especially if you are dead set on having children or have had infertility issues in the past/present because it can cause problems. Stay safe everyone!‚ù§Ô∏è

**UPDATE
so there is a subreddit specifically for Ureaplasma and I learned the infection can cause Pelvic floor dysfunction!! So if you have any urethral burning, dry vaginal canal, and other symptoms but no infection of any sort pelvic floor exercises, stretches, and breathing techniques can help! Magnesium too! Our body holds stress/trauma in three places, the pelvic area being one of them. Our every day stress has MESSED UP a lot of our body and if you have had childhood trauma, abuse, or any traumatic events in general a lot of that gets stored in our body and can cause problems from the hips down, including lower back pain!! I will continue to post on here often now about ways to release that trauma and get your health back on track!‚ù§Ô∏è 
‚Äîi want you all to know as well many women show different symptoms and different treatments work for different women. As I am not a dr and am just passing along info i learned from my gyno I highly suggest researching it/talking to your gyno or primary care dr to learn more :)

**Second update! Its come to my attention I didnt add some important points to this! So first of all you can get tested by getting a swab done or urine test, however for women a swab is going to be the most accurate test as urine tests dont always find it! Second, theres a lack of knowledge of this STI in the medical community WORLDWIDE and a lot of DRs DONT treat or test for this infection! Its sad and can cause further debt and pain to us, but if your dr wont test for it SEE SOMEONE ELSE! It IS real and you shouldnt let ignorant drs prevent you from getting the help you need! If you test positive and are treated and need to get your partner tested but the dr says you dont need to‚Ä¶WALK AWAY. You can get this sti again if your partner is not treated, so find a DR who will treat them! I do not have a list of Drs who do and dont treat this STI, but on the Ureaplasma subreddit there are some posts listing where you can go in every state in the US as well as a few in other nations! Also if your DR doesnt know about ureaplasma but is willing to help you and test for it they may ask for a test code which you can also find on the ureaplasma subreddit! The link to it/more info is in the comments! Feel free to DM me for link and questions or comment it on this post.

To give some background my boyfriend and I both have decided together that we don‚Äôt want kids. I do want a tubal eventually but I know at my age a doctor most likely wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable preforming that procedure because I'm 21 years old with no kids. It‚Äôs nothing against anyone who does that want or have kids, we just don‚Äôt feel called to parenthood truthfully. And with the state of the world it also would just be best not to have children that‚Äôs just what we prefer. SO I decided to discuss doing the 10 year hormone free IUD, along with my birth control pills to help with my hormonal imbalances and PCOS symptoms. On top of that my boyfriend and I hike and will be taking multiple day long hiking trips and I want to be extra safe as well just in case I forget to take my birth control pill.. I told my gyno about all of that and which she is still going to see if insurance will cover the IUD‚Ä¶. BUT in the mix of all of this she felt the need to interject and tell me that ‚Äúthe reason most couples don‚Äôt want kids is because they just haven‚Äôt found the right person yet. So you may not have found the right person to want babies with yet‚Äù‚Ä¶. Which completely rubbed me the wrong way. So I stopped her and explained even growing up as a child I didn‚Äôt want kids and that I don‚Äôt feel right having kids in such a crazy world and she told me THAT WAS EVEN MORE OF A REASON TO HAVE KIDS! So to me it feels like she invalidated my beliefs and tried to insinuate my relationship wasn‚Äôt valid because we don‚Äôt want to have kids.

I got the Mirena IUD 6 months ago when I was 6 weeks postpartum with my second child. I've never had it but I wanted a long lasting birth control. It was fine for the first month but I started to have some pain, weird bleeding, and a lot of discharge. They did an ultrasound and found it was in the right place but I did have BV infection.

Fast forward 6 months later and I'm miserable. I've gained SO much weight, I'm so bloated, irritable (which I never am), depressed, and worst of all, sex was starting to be super painful during and after (tmi sorry). I went in and saw a NP that I don't usually see and told her all of this. She said my only symptom that could be IUD related was acne. I was pissed. She took out the IUD (I haven't been able to feel my strings for months, something they also knew) and low and behold my IUD was sitting really low. She said my body was trying to expel it and that she's never seen that before. I felt like I was going crazy, that the pain was in my head and that I'd just have to suck it up!!

f7169b,Periods,1582238344.0,"I started getting period symptoms two weeks before my period came - the standard sore breasts and bloating. It was around the same time I experienced the most intense depression ever. For two weeks, I was crying every five minutes, leaving my bed genuinely made me feel sick, talking to other people was so exhausting the second I entered my room I would break down, I didn't pay attention in my classes (failed one of my assignments) and during work I would feel so heavy it distracted me constantly. 

This was different to average menstrual-sadness. I can't even begin to describe how low and heavy I felt all the time. 

Anyway, my period came after two weeks of agony (I started going to therapy again because I thought I was seriously depressed - began to consider medication) and I'm not lying when I say as soon as my period came, a huge wave of relief just washed over me.

z97h92,Healthyhooha,1669851862.0,"Hi everyone. I've been lurking here for months looking for helpful info and never posted before, but I decided to finally post because I myself found some info that I thought might be helpful. I wanted to share links to a number of studies I've come across in my research as I try to find a way through my chronic/recurrent, drug-resistant yeast infection, which I've been fighting for over a year. In short, these studies all point to the possibility of IUDs being a major contributing factor in recurrent yeast infections (recurrent vulovaginal candidiasis, RVVC) for many people who have them.

The studies suggest that this is due to candida biofilms forming on the surface of the IUDS, specifically the strings. These biofilms are slower-growing groups of yeast cells covered with a protective layer consisting mainly of proteins that prevents whatever you're being treated with from being able to kill the yeast. This puts you in a situation where you can treat the infection over and over, and every time, kill all of the free floating yeast cells, but more yeast cells will keep on emerging from the biofilm and reinfecting you.

This mirrors the way yeast biofilms can form on other types of implanted medical devices, and cause chronic candidiasis in other systems/regions of the body. This mechanism doesn't have to do with what type of IUD it is, whether it is hormonal or copper; it's as simple as yeast cells clinging to it because it's a static physical object.

There also appears to be a correlation between biofilm-forming yeasts and those that are more resistant to drug therapy even when cultured and tested in the lab (ie, even outside of any biofilm), with drug-resistant yeasts more likely to form biofilms.

Some of these studies also discuss that this can happen with BV infections as well.

I'm putting the links in the comments due to link posting restrictions in this sub.

After reading all of this, I've decided to get my IUD removed (Mirena) in the hopes that it will help my treatments to finally outrun my infection, even though it's the only birth control method that has ever worked well for me. I am not saying that I think everyone else should definitely do the same, but I thought this information might be worth considering for anyone in a similar situation.

qcf2c9,Healthyhooha,1634775929.0,"This is a long one, TLDR; I went to the ER for an incredibly painful bartholin gland cyst. My nurse gave me the most traumatic, excruciating, agonizing experience of my life by not properly numbing me before slicing my vagina open, and even did it after telling her I was not numb yet. 

I get reoccurring bartholin gland cysts, about once a year I have to go to the ER to get it drained. I‚Äôve had them for 7 years. The first time I got it drained, my obgyn didn‚Äôt use enough anesthesia and it hurt REALLY. BAD. After that when I started going to the ER for it because I‚Äôm living in my college town, it was a better experience because they use numbing cream before the injection. The numbing injection is the worst part. It HURTS, but it is significantly better with numbing cream. 

2 days ago I had another one and I started running a high fever which was pretty concerning, so I went to the ER. It was actually the best experience out of all of them. The injection (while it‚Äôs never fun or pleasant) wasn‚Äôt as bad, and as intended, I don‚Äôt feel the ‚Äòslice‚Äô one bit. It really is the needle that really really sucks. 

The next day (yesterday) it suddenly came back full swing. I‚Äôve never had it come back within a year, let alone one day. I took many Epsom salt baths, tried warm compresses, everything. Today it was excruciating. I‚Äôve never had my cyst hurt that bad before. I came back to the ER, crying constantly from the pain. I was about to get sliced again, but I knew because of how irritated and painful it already was, this injection was going to be absolute hell. 

I BEGGED to be put under, while absolutely sobbing. My nurse declined, but I kinda expected that. She pulls out the needle and I‚Äôm like ‚Äúwait, can you use numbing spray first?‚Äù She says no. I beg her. She says it doesn‚Äôt work much anyway. I assure her, I‚Äôve lost count of how many times I‚Äôve gotten this drained, IT. HELPS. She says ‚Äúwe ran out‚Äù. It‚Äôs a huge hospital. I highly, HIGHLY doubt there isn‚Äôt a single thing of numbing spray. So I‚Äôm sobbing, terrified, I know how bad this is going to be. So she injects me and I let out this absolute wail/scream/cry. I‚Äôve never heard this sound come out of my mouth. It was the most excruciating pain I‚Äôve ever felt in my entire life. She pokes my cyst with a knife to test if I‚Äôm numb, I‚Äôm not.

Wow I honestly did not expect this much backlash and support from this post. Also don't appreciate some of the names I've been called... But I digress.
I realize a lot of you don't care about the Tampon Emoji and that you think this is a ""first world problem"" but I think it is important to have an emoji that doesn't sweep something COMPLETELY NATURAL under the rug. A blood drop emoji isn't enough. A blood drop emoji can mean a lot of things. I mean maybe I am naive or just a female pms-ing at the moment or maybe I'm feeling entitled. But I think it is important for the younger generations to be more open and not be afraid to talk about periods. It's not that bad! My entire life people have referred to a period as; dot, monthly, pms, red week, hell week, and much worse. They never directly say ""period"" no one ever just wants to say ""period"". So this is a small effort to show that maybe we do need one. No matter how small or insignificant it seems to you.

Women need more recognition when it comes to their periods. Please sign this petition to get Apple to make a Tampon Emoji.

ka70ly,Healthyhooha,1607568999.0,"Okay, am I the only person who has had success with using a zinc oxide cream (AKA literally a diaper rash cream like Bordeaux‚Äôs or Desitin üòÇ) for fishy vaginal odor?!

For the record, there‚Äôs NO way this was normal body odor ‚Äî I would have a fishy smell even right after I took a shower. Over the years, I‚Äôve tried antibiotics, apple cider vinegar, boric acid suppositories, you name it. Boric acid helped, but as soon as I stopped using it, the smell would come back. This wasn‚Äôt a yeast infection ‚Äî I‚Äôve had terrible yeast infections that were always insanely itchy and fixed them right up with Monistat. Was this bacterial? Fungal? Who the fuck knows. The point is ‚Äî the smell was not pleasant and I‚Äôve had it for years.

Anyway, here‚Äôs what I did for THREE DAYS and I haven‚Äôt had any odor since. Again, this is after years ‚Äî years ‚Äî of struggling and wondering what the fuck I was going to do. Though you‚Äôll notice there were some other steps here, nothing *ever* worked without the addition of the zinc oxide cream.

*Step 1* At night, I took a shower & used Babyganics body wash (it‚Äôs a fragrance free thing meant for infants haha) on my vulva.
*Step 2* Dried off.
*Step 3* literally spread Bordeaux‚Äôs Butt Paste (yep) on my vulva ‚Äî do not put this stuff inside your vagina ‚Äî put on a pair of cotton underwear, and went to bed.
*Step 4* repeated the next night.
*Step 5* repeated the next night.

That‚Äôs it. To be clear, I am still only using the Babyganics wash on my more sensitive areas, but using this never helped until I added the zinc oxide cream for a few days.

Am I the only person who has tried this and succeeded?! I have no idea what made me want to do it. I‚Äôm pretty sure someone once told me they used a zinc oxide cream for like athlete‚Äôs foot or something and I was like fuck it, it can‚Äôt hurt, let‚Äôs give it a shot.

Why this worked? I have no idea. I know zinc oxide is a moisture repellent, but that‚Äôs about the extent of my science.

Can someone else pleeeeaaase try this and report back?! It is such a cheap, private, and doable thing, I needed to get the word out there!

j39w75,Healthyhooha,1601563420.0,"Tdlr; My detailed experience getting a colposcopy at 23. Get your checks, but don't freak out, it's fine.

I'm 23 and recently was recommended to get a colposcopy. I saw some people posted about their experiences but it wasn't really a reflection of how mine went. So I figured I'd post. 

My doctor was actually hesitant to go through with the exam because she said that most people under the age of 24 will flush out anything harmful, like pre cancerous cells, but since I am HPV positive this year she was still going to go through with it She made it clear she was on the fence about doing it at all. 

I'm going to give a step by step of my experience so other people who have anxiety can be at ease. So the first thing she does is put in the speculum, this is as unpleasant as always, but a 1/10 on the pain scale because you can ignore it after a while. So the doctor sits between your legs and uses a microscope (looks like that machine you wear to get your eyes checked for glasses) and they take some swabs. Now they have to put 2 solutions on. One is a vinegar and one is iodine. The vinegar BURNED HORRIBLY. It's super uncomfortable, but it dulls over time. The initial shock is a little brutal. I didn't take any ibuprofen but I  don't know if it would have helped. Honestly if I'm not being a baby about it, it's was a 4/10 for pain just feels bad because you're not used to that kind of burn in your vag.  So then she did some more swabs, put in the iodine and did more swabs. The rest feels like a normal pap, you can't feel the swabs that much and it's not that bad. The doctor will move the speculum around because she wanted to be thorough, but all you feel is it moving and some pressure. It's uncomfortable but doesn't really hurt. 

She ended up not doing a biopsy because it looked OK and also I'm young. So she removed the speculum, asked if I had any questions and gave me a pad (because the iodine will give you funky discharge). 

My doctor explained everything really well. She told me that HPV is like a cold for your cervix, which was a great explaination. I feel like gyns in the past have not been as clear or explained things as thoroughly as she did and I often get health anxiety. But now I'm feeling really good and my anxiety is at ease. I'll get my results from the swabs at some point, but I don't feel stressed at all.

j6yvzp,WomensHealth,1602103022.0,"Hi, everybody. I am the girl who went from wondering whether her ovary was dead to finding out she had straight-up ovarian cancer. I had my first chemo appointment and...well, it did not go as well as I hoped. I figured I should update.

The original plan was for me to have three hours of Taxol and 30-40 minutes of Carboplatin afterwards. They managed to get me hooked up to the IV, gave me all of my prep medications, and then injected the Taxol. Of course, they warned me beforehand to let them know if something felt wrong, as on rare occasions there are people who are allergic to Taxol, and if they are it is very likely the reaction would happen within the first 10 minutes of administration. I wasn't that worried at first, because I have no history of being allergic to anything.

Of course that would change near the 10-minute mark, and I am now painfully aware that I am allergic to the Taxol. 

It happened so quickly. One moment I was fine, then felt encroaching nausea and noticed little lights floating around in my vision. I was in the middle of saying something to my friend who was there with me, when suddenly it hit me; my chest felt like it was crumpling, my throat closing, and my tongue swelling a bit. I used my last breaths to scream for help. I felt bad doing that in a room full of cancer patients going through such a hard treatment...but damn it, I was so terrified...It hit so hard and suddenly, and my body was struggling to scream and cough on instinct. I had never dealt with that before...I have also been told that my body was turning interesting shades of red and I had goosebumps everywhere. My friend was freaking out and trying to help them however she could.

Thankfully the nurses gave me some steroids to help me out of it, and they stopped the procedure. They are planning to give me a variant of Taxol that does not have the same mixed compounds, as they claimed my reaction matches up to that as the issue. They kept me monitored for 40 minutes and sent me home, albeit a bit hesitantly due to my low blood pressure (I am so glad I just finished with those blood thinners this morning). We will be trying again on Tuesday.

I feel dead tired...they said that is normal, though.

Bright side, if this variant works, I will only need 30-40 minutes of it compared to the 3 hours the regular Taxol calls for.

nbqvq7,TwoXSupport,1620938491.0,"Sex is something that so many women have a complex relationship to, and something that is so often intertwined with our mental health. I suffer from bipolar disorder which leads to hypersexuality during my manic episodes and I cannot count how many sexual experiences I've had that I've deeply regretted or felt unsafe during. And sure, you can say Bipolar is a niche experience that only...what? 2%? Of the population has. But I've seen women with depression go through this too, turn to sex as a sort of comfort/distraction from their pain. Not to mention women who've recently left abusive situations and are experiencing trauma. Sexual trauma and hypersexuality have been linked in many research studies, with the going theory being that traumatized people turn to sex as both a distraction from their trauma and a way to feel like they're ""regaining their power"", but of course it often just ends up feeling bad and uncomfortable.

I don't know, it just pisses me off that so many women carry the shame of so many negative sexual experiences because it's rarely a conversation that's held widely. Pretty much every woman I know, myself included, has regretted her one night stands, or the sex she had when she was feeling vulnerable and in a bad mental headspace, because sex with strangers just isn't a positive or healthy experience most of the time, and feeling misplaced shame on top of that makes it so much fucking worse.

And don't even get me started with women who \*aren't\* that sexual but feel pressured to be. Women who feel like they need to be into rough sex because some dipshit loser they were dating made them feel bad about not being into it. Or women who feel like they can't be into normal vanilla sex because they've been made to feel like that's ""boring"" and ""prudish"". Or women who feel like they can't not be into sex that often at all, because not being a source of sexual availability means you've ""failed"" as a woman somehow.

I don't know. I want this to be better. I'm sick of seeing women feel ashamed just for fucking existing and being human and imperfect and having complex relationships to sex. And I'm sick of there being very little mainstream advice on how to navigate these situations, how to be safe sexually when you're struggling with mental health issues, or how to establish boundaries around sex as a whole, how to stand firm with your own sexual choices.

Hi all. My 9 year old daughter has woken up this morning and told me that when she went to pee her vagina hurt. Initially I thought she meant her urethra and that she had a urine infection but she said it's her vagina. I had a look and could not see any redness/inflammation but she could not open her legs very wide because she said she felt a tearing sensation. She has now washed with warm water and put some cream on it. 

Could this be her hymen? I don't ever recall mine breaking so I have no reference point. Or is it possible that it's vulvovaginitis? Did anyone experience anything like this as a child? She was wearing a onesie in bed so I don't think she could have scratched herself. We talk openly about body parts and I reassured her that if this happened as a result of her touching or scratching herself she has nothing to be embarrassed about.

c3j4jq,WomensHealth,1561164955.0,"My friends call me Lizard. I'm 24, and I wanted to share my story.

Ever since I was 14 or 15, about 10 years ago, I have had very heavy periods. Like, abnormally heavy. To the point where, around 20, I was soaking through about 10-12 ultra tampons a day and/or changing my Diva cup on the hour every hour. In January of this year, I stopped being able to wear insertables entirely and ended up giving in and buying adult diapers because they were the only thing strong enough to get me through the day without leakage. 

I started going to the doctor for them in my late teens. Nothing was ever found on imaging and a ""diagnosis"" of endometriosis was slapped on me repeatedly by about 4-5 doctors so they could put me on birth control. It worked for about a year before the pill became completely ineffective and my heavy, painful periods returned. Nothing was ever found. No legitimate diagnosis was ever given. Eventually, I gave up for several years and just dealt with it the best I could despite being in enough pain that I'd spend days curled up in fetal position on the floor, lying in the bathtub as I let scalding hot water pour over my abdomen, or bent over the toilet vomiting. Painkillers didn't work, and still don't. I've been on everything from Tylenol to morphine and nothing kills the pain.

Eventually, it got so bad last August that work started sending me home semi regularly because I was in too much pain to move. I decided to see a GYN again, this time at a MayoClinic branch in Southern Minn. Once again, ultrasounds revealed nothing. She suggested a Mirena IUD. I went for it. I expelled it within a month. We tried a second one. Once again, I expelled it. As a last resort, we tried the Nexplanon around the beginning of April this year - by that time i had been on my period for about a month straight with no reprieve. She told me to send her a portal message if I experienced anything more than light spotting and minor cramping, which I did.

The following Tuesday, I received a reply from a doctor that was answering her messages while she was on a week leave that basically told me to take a couple of ibuprofen and suck it up. Lots of women have heavy periods. It's not that bad.

I almost passed out that day on the way to the bathroom.

About a week and a half later, I was sent home from work twice because I was lightheaded and nauseous and throwing up. I didn't think much of it because I had caught a cold that previous weekend. I was supposed to move to Tennessee on the coming Friday, April 26, so I figured I'd suck it up and keep going, because what I else can I do?

Friday April 26 was the day that I passed out in the HyVee checkout line.

I had no idea what happened. I woke up to a store employee who worked part time as an EMT yelling, ""call the paramedics, she hit her head."" I have no idea what happened, just that I felt dizzy one second and was on the floor with a massive gash in my head the next. I got carted away in an ambulance with full neck brace to the local hospital, where they told me I probably passed out because of dehydration, but they wanted to run a blood test just in case. The doctor returned, white faced, and told me that I basically shouldn't have been able to walk. My hemoglobin tested at 6.1, 0.9 units below the threshold for a transfusion.

That's when they gave me the first transfusion. I continued to bleed all night, passing clot after clot the size of eggs. My nurses were horrified when they saw that, no, I wasn't joking about how much I had been bleeding or how big my clots were. It got worse after the transfusions because my blood count had gone up. It was almost like my body had been trying to preserve itself by letting my hemoglobin get so low, and I felt like a leaky tire: every time they tried to put more blood in me, I'd just bleed until I was down near that threshold. They loaded me full of TXA and IV estrogen and dilaudid in hopes of stopping the pain and bleeding. It made me so nauseous I was given Phenergen, after which I started having severe convulsions. Turns out I'm allergic. They gave me Ativan and more dilaudid, effectively knocking me out until the Phenergen was out of my system. 

The bleeding slowed but didn't stop, but it was light enough doctors were able to give me a second transplant on April 28. I was supposed to have been in TN for 2 days at that point. I was supposed to see one of my favorite musicians that night. Instead, I was in the hospital bleeding all over the nice white linens and trying not to vomit as they pumped blood into my system hoping to get my counts up.

I was discharged on April 29 and moved to TN on May 1 with a post-hospital visit set up with Vanderbilt Womens Health and instructions to go to the ER if I started bleeding heavily again, which I did that Saturday. That was my second trip to the ER. It was a smaller hospital near my apartment, so they couldn't do much except check my blood counts and put me on an estrogen taper in hopes of slowing down the bleeding. It didn't work.

At my post-hospital visit, they did a biopsy and an ultrasound, finding several small fibroids and signs of adenomyosis. A week later, my bleeding still hadn't slowed down, so they removed my Nexplanon implant. It took about an hour as the implant had been encapsulated in scar tissue. That weekend, the bleeding became even heavier.

That Sunday, May 26, was my third visit to the ER. Once again, they couldn't do much except call Vanderbilt to ask about it, give me more IV estrogen, TXA, and a few painkillers, and tell me that if I started experiencing shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, and dizziness that I should go back to the ER and try to go to Vanderbilt since that's where my GYN was. My hemoglobin tested at 7.3.

That Tuesday during work, I became heavily symptomatic. My coworkers called me a Lyft to take me to Vanderbilt's ER. My hemoglobin hadn't changed since that weekend, but because I was heavily symptomatic, I was given my 3rd blood transfusion of the month. Afterward, once again, I started having immense pain and passing clot after egg-sized clot. I was given morphine, which put me out. I was in the ER for 4 days while they waited to find me a room. My mom drove 8hrs to make sure I didn't have to suffer alone. Doctors came and went, but I don't remember much other than crying and saying that I was terrified to go home because I'd just end up back in the ER if they discharged me. I had my 4th transfusion while still in the ER as my hemoglobin levels wouldn't stabilize. The on duty nurse wouldn't give me pain meds or anything to help me sleep, so I threw up about 4 separate times because I was in so much pain, though she claimed I was having a reaction to the blood. If that was the caee, why hadn't I thrown up the last time?

Eventually, they found me a room and booked me in for a hysteroscopy on Friday the 31. They prepped me for surgery, put me out, and then presented both my mom and I with the news:

I have fibroids. The most severe case of fibroids my surgeon of 20+ years had ever seen. He told both me and my mom flat out that he'd only ever seen a handful of cases like mine, and only in women over 35. Never in someone so young. 10 years of going to the doctor trying to get a diagnosis and failing, only to finally get a diagnosis that my uterus was more tumor than organ. I have to reason that they took so long to find because, statistically, people my age don't typically get fibroids. At least, not this severe. It irritates me to know that no one found them before, and that consistently trying birth control and IUDs probably worsened them as fibroids feed off estrogen and progesterone.

They removed the two largest fibroids (measuring 1.5cm and 3cm in diameter) but were unable to scrape my entire uterus. When I woke up from anesthesia, I felt better than I had in YEARS. Since then, my bleeding has stopped, my hemoglobin has gone back up, and I'm starting to get my energy back.

That said, I still have a uterus full of tumors, and the worse the case of fibroids, the bigger the chance that they'll grow back. Even if it won't be for 3-7+ years, knowing my luck, they will be back. I'm currently in talks with my doctor about a hysterectomy. I've bled enough in the past 10 years to have 2-3 lifetimes of periods, and I just want it done.

14hfsw6,WomensHealth,1687570204.0,"I‚Äôm 22/F and I feel like nobody gets it. Every time I have attempted sex it has gone badly - whether it be from vaginismus making sex painful and not even allowing entry, to randomly developing UTI‚Äôs after intercourse - even with both of us showering and being clean before sex and using a condoms, to light bleeding after sex from being overly ‚Äútight‚Äù and causing some minor tears. 

My best friend told me the last time I talked to her that she loves having sex and that it is amazing, and I wish I could relate. 

It is such a pain in the ass to treat these issues though I have just given up. I was in pelvic floor therapy after telling my doctor about experiencing pain from penetrative sex, but I hate constantly being examined by doctors trying to figure out the issue. I hate being poked and prodded, and pelvic floor therapy itself was very uncomfortable because most of the nurses were my age and it felt so stupid having to be there in the first place. I felt as if they were judging me the entire time. And the exercises they had me do felt useless to treating it. 

I think my issue is directly related with having scoliosis, or an unnatural curving of the spine, because the spine is connected to the pelvic floor, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it is somehow putting stress on my pelvic floor muscles causing them to work harder than they need. But I don‚Äôt know. I do not think it it is directly related to any actual issues with my vagina itself as these symptoms are elusive and not always consistent. But even if it is scoliosis - there is nothing I can do as the only fix is surgery and I don‚Äôt think my curve is severe enough to consider it. But the last time I had an x-ray done was when I was 13. 

Most of the guys in my area do not understand at all the health issues that I am dealing with and think the pain is minor - but the pain I get from penetration makes it feel like everything is on fire if I am not careful. But I have no STD‚Äôs, nothing like endometriosis, fibroids, or PCOS(though this isn‚Äôt confirmed and I am suspicious).

I have had some weird symptoms in the past - like I went two years straight without a period and I swear doctors didn‚Äôt believe me. But after I took birth control for a week my cycle returned as normal and hasn‚Äôt stopped since minus missing a period every now and then. Nobody has bothered trying to explain that one to me and just shrugged it off. But I have always wondered about that.

It kinda burns after I urinate, not during. A little whitish discharge was also coming out but it didn't smell. 
STIs can't be the reason because neither he nor me have had any partner before. Idk about a UTI though. 
It also begins to hurt if I start getting aroused. It has been 48 hours. No I cannot go to any doctor, so please please help me.

it was very frustrating and it made me hate even bringing up any of my concerns. i finally sucked it up and made an obgyn appointment, and was shocked by how easy it was. all i said was that my periods are really painful and hard to deal with, and she was ready to prescribe birth control before i even suggested it. she told me some of my other options but ultimately settled on starting with the pill to see how i like it, and how my body handles it.

jyw6no,TwoXSupport,1606054085.0,"So I thought this would be an interesting thing to discuss but was too frightened of backlash to post on TwoX...

Sometimes I browse AITA and something that seems to come up regularly there is the situation of who is allowed to be in the delivery room (more specifically, men throwing a fit because their partner/the woman carrying the baby doesn‚Äôt want him in the room whilst she gives birth) 

Since COVID, women are only allowed to choose one person and many of them choose their mum rather than the father of the baby - the outrage this provokes on AITA is pretty upsetting - comments include things like...

 ‚Äúif my wife did this I‚Äôd divorce her‚Äù 

‚Äúyou are entitled to be in the room, it‚Äôs your baby too!‚Äù

‚Äúshe‚Äôs a selfish *insert sexist and hurtful word here*‚Äù. 

‚ÄúChildbirth is a beautiful family moment, if my wife took it away from me I‚Äôd never forgive her‚Äù

‚ÄúYou have every right to be in there!‚Äù

I guess I was hoping to hear your opinions on this, personally I think birth is a medical procedure and not a spectator sport and not one person is entitled to be there besides the woman experiencing it. Once the baby is born they have equal say, until then it is entirely the person risking their life who gets to choose (and should be able to do so without being vilified and attacked) 

I think the romanticising of childbirth in media is another factor in the prominence of men‚Äôs entitlement.

It upsets me a lot because I‚Äôm terrified of pregnancy and childbirth and don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôd do ... maybe I‚Äôd want to be alone, maybe I‚Äôd want my boyfriend, maybe I‚Äôd want my mum (the woman who carried me inside her for 9 months, raised and loved me for 24 years...) To be shamed, called selfish and criticised for making the choice that‚Äôs best for you in a life threatening situation must be really awful. 

I think it‚Äôs totally unfair for the fathers to put their feelings over the woman‚Äôs and tbh, the sense of entitlement to women‚Äôs bodies continues to baffle and frighten me. 

Saying that, I can understand feeling (privately) hurt that your partner didn‚Äôt choose you, but can‚Äôt imagine how you wouldn‚Äôt just want what‚Äôs best for mother and baby during delivery, even if that meant you waited outside.

1ak2b2n,Periods,1707197160.0," So me (19F) and my situationship/gf? (19F) have been seeing each other for the last 5 months sexually but have known eachother for around 9 months. I mention this because we have a really comfortable and honest relationship where we basically feel comfortable doing anything around eachother. But the last 2 times i saw her (we are semi long distance so i only see her every month or so) she has gotten her period. Again, i have zero issue with this (obviously being a woman myself) and even have had period sex. Where my issue stands is that she literally does not wear or use any sort of period product when she gets it with me. No pad, tampon, period underwear, diva cup, etc. nothing - just free bleeding. Her periods are heavy and it gets to the point where she bleeds completely through my bedding and pants leaving huge marks and staining the mattress. I feel awkward talking about this with her since i know she can‚Äôt control her periods. and i know she feels embarrassed by waking up and seeing the blood stains on the bed, but instead of letting me know, she tries to hide it by laying on it or covering with a sheet. also, before we do things, she never tells me that she‚Äôs on her periods and just pretends it‚Äôs not there and even lies about being on it when i do acknowledge it( claims to have heavy nose bleed in the night, cut her leg etc). What put me over the edge was when i gave her my pants to wear for a day, and she again didn‚Äôt wear any sort of period product, and completely bled through my pants AND onto my car seat. Instead of telling me or any attempts to clean the blood out of my pants, she gives me the pants folded so i can‚Äôt see it and doesn‚Äôt say a word or act like anything wrong. I also didn‚Äôt notice until she left and i was refolding laundry.

Should i have the right to feel grossed out? and should I i say anything? i dont want to make it weird.

I only recently learned that what I thought was my ""urethra"" was actually my clitoris, but let's not go there.

Women, please hear me, for I have a clitoris and I am in despair. Due to previous methods of solo-sex, I have damaged my clitoris. After looking at some educational videos, I have found that they do vary in color, size, and shape. Mine has a hole in/near it.

It hinders sex with a partner. No partner of mine has been able to touch it (with anything, not even a gentle graze of their fingertip or tongue) without being in pain.

I know I'm not the only one but I don't see many posts like this! I've managed and gratefully solo-sex is not painful.

I don't know if you ladies would need picture proof to believe me (many have not believed me), but I'm vastly uncomfortable with putting it out on the internet.

I'm also a bit less in despair now that I know more about my body. I had an appointment with a sexual wellness doctor to talk it over. I have another appointment later in December (the 21st) to go over what bits are what with her and what bothers me. She has stated that since solo sex is not painful for me, everything sounds normal to her, which is a relief.

Does anyone else relate? I feel like some people do. I think I've heard whispers about other women struggling with this. What should I tell my doctor so that I feel heard but also so that something could be done?

Hi there. You may remember me from [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Periods/comments/14iwrit/can_anyone_tell_me_what_this_is_it_fell_out_of_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=1), where I was trying to figure out what fell out of me in the shower. We'll, I have my answer, and it isn't a fibroid after all. After sending it for a biopsy, we discovered that it was necrotic chorionic villi  tissue--basically, placental matter left over from a previous miscarriage, which had become wrapped in more layers of tissue (sort of like an oyster making a pearl) until it got too big and just fell out.

My OBGYN suspects that the tissue is from a 2016 miscarriage and probably caused the two subsequent miscarriages I had by preventing the embryo from attaching to the uterine wall. This could have been prevented if I had ever been scanned for retained products of conception after any of my miscarriages, but I wasn't, and I didn't know enough to push for it.

So this is my PSA: if you have a miscarriage, make them check for retained products of conception after you've stopped bleeding. This has caused me serious health issues, especially with my period (which has been lighter, less intense, and with seriously reduced cramping and PMS symptoms).

We went and got really super drunk out at the bars a month or so ago. We got back to my place and did only hand stuff to each other. I realized only after that we did not remember to wash our hands. I woke up the next morning feeling really itchy and smelly down there, and knew it was BV.

No worries, I took a shower and it seemed like itchy symptoms went away, little smell but not horrible so I thought I was in the clear.

The following week we meet up again and things lead into full on sex this time. During it, the smell came back again from me and I legit smelled like FISH. I have no idea if he noticed (we were optimal levels of drunk this time). My heart sank and I prayed he did not notice. We finished anyway and the sex was great nonetheless. We hung out the entire day after and he even willingly stayed longer than expected, so in my head if there was an issue with it he was chill and looking past it. He was fine hanging with fishy me. 

Idk why I felt too scared to bring it up anyway to clear myself, I guess I did not want him to feel bad for giving me BV.

I made an appointment to get treated for BV but it‚Äôd be a few weeks later.

We meet up again a couple weeks later (before my dr appt) to go to a concert and drink and we have an amazing time. We hang out again for 24hrs enjoying each other‚Äôs company, but this time nothing sexual happens.

We texted for a few days after a lot, and when I mentioned doing the museum thing next week, he stopped responding. That was Friday. 

Now all I can think about is it‚Äôs the fish.

He may be thinking I always smelly fishy.

What can I do to bring this up now? In my head this would be an acceptable dealbreaker for him whether this stays as a fwb or actual dating.

1d024do,Healthyhooha,1716604960.0,"Been seeing one gyno regularly for my reoccurring BV for the past year now. At my last appointment I requested to be tested for ureaplasma, as my BV just keeps coming back no matter the treatment course. 

That gyno told me the office didn‚Äôt offer that kind of test and that she‚Äôd like to try out a long-term treatment plan just to see if that works before referring me out to a specialist‚Äîas I‚Äôve been on multiple rounds of oral antibiotics and boric acid already with no success

Cut to a month into my long term metronidazole gel treatment plan given by this gyno and my symptoms are raging, worse than before I started. She had me start this new treatment plan with another round of 7 day oral antibiotics, and within a week after finishing the oral antibiotics and starting the use of the gel twice weekly, as she specifically told me to do, my symptoms came back raging. 

I read others who were being denied those urea/mycoplasma tests as well and some advice they got was to ask for it in writing so it‚Äôs on your medical record that they denied a test you specifically requested so they can be held liable for it or something like that if that just so happens to be the test you needed. 

So I went back just a month after my last appointment because I honestly don‚Äôt wanna be a guinea pig for this long-term treatment plan the next 3 months, at least not without being diligent about testing for all possible causes and getting to the root beforehand, considering it isn‚Äôt guaranteed to work and my symptoms have only worsened, not gotten better in the slightest.


And this time that usual gyno I was seeing wasn‚Äôt in the office on that particular day of the week so I saw another gyno in that same office. And that‚Äôs exactly what I did. I told the other gyno I specifically asked for the ureaplasma test last time and was denied, asked for the test or a referral to a specialist again and stated if it would be denied I‚Äôd like that in writing‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and what do you know?! The gyno walked back into the room with not only a ureaplasma test but ALSO a mycoplasma test that I hadn‚Äôt even mentioned or thought of! In the same exact office the other gyno told me they didn‚Äôt provide those tests!

151ck23,Healthyhooha,1689529702.0,"Spoiler alert: Pelvic floor therapy / dilators work, guys.

Background: In March 2022 I had BV and yeast infections back and forth, by summer it was ureaplasma, and by December I was diagnosed with provoked vestibulodynia. My gyno said all the repeat infections caused my body and pelvic floor to feel like it‚Äôs always fighting off an infection so it was always red, burning, inflamed and dry. Sex felt like I was sticking burning sandpaper in there so I gave up trying completely and eventually that relationship ended (for other reasons, not because of no sex). I was also diagnosed with interstitial cystitis.

Current Day: So it had been about a year and a half since I had pleasurable, wet, pain-free sex. After the breakup, I believed no one would want me since I can‚Äôt provide sex and I felt hopeless everyday. But after a few months of using dilators and taking meds and natural remedies, I am thrilled to report that I WAS ABLE TO HAVE SPONTANEOUS PLEASURABLE SEX ON VACATION!! 4 times‚Ä¶ but who‚Äôs counting? (me)

What I did to get to this point:

1. Pelvic floor therapy and dilators: I tried PFT once but it was expensive so I bought my own set of 5 dilators starting from the skinniest size to the biggest. I insert one inch every other night using Good Clean Love sensitive lube. Lightly use pressure on the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o clock areas and eventually practiced penetration with them to mimic the in and out movement of sex. At first it burned and stung like sex but the feeling goes away slightly after 20 min. This cannot be something you try once for 5 min. Practice makes perfect, I‚Äôm still learning as well. Diaphragmatic breathing, soft music, laying down, getting relaxed is key. Graduate to the next size dilator when you stop feeling pain with the current one! Also, the program/website called Pelvic Sense has great stretches, exercises and medical information for vulvodynia. 

2. Find a doctor or gyno who listens, cares, and wants to genuinely help. It took 6 different doctors to find the one I have now‚Äî it is not easy but it‚Äôs so rewarding and relieving to finally find one who is willing to try every possible measure to get you relief. Mine prescribed me gabapentin cream, recommended all the Good Clean Love products, and told me to stop blow drying down there after showering because that was making me extra dry. 

3. Magnesium helps with nerve damage, ashwaganda promotes libido and moisture down there, and d mannose helps with my bladder issues. 

4. Never stop talking about your vagina, never stop seeking help and relief. My family is sick and tired of me talking about my issues but idgaf. The vagina is no different from discussing any other medical issue like having heart problems or diabetes or something. It‚Äôs a painful experience that has affected everything in my life, not just sex. What I wear, what I eat, if I feel like going out, how I sit, how I sleep, how often I go to the bathroom, how much money I‚Äôve wasted, doctors visits, random rawness or discomfort, swimming, the smell down there, my confidence, depression, etc. 

If I think of more that‚Äôs helped me I will add it in the comments but I recommend the dilators most of all. I don‚Äôt feel completely hopeless anymore and I want to share this to anyone who feels like they‚Äôll never be able to have sex or enjoy life or find love.

Then she announced my cervix is really inflamed, she left me on the table with the speculum in to go find additional equipment to get more samples.
She did the thing where they get a sample from the cervix and I reacted negatively by tensing up, because it hurt.
She told me this is a bad sign, it means something is wrong. I told her that it always hurts and causes mild bleeding for me, ever since my first exam at age 15 (I‚Äôm 30)
She said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs very odd‚Äù
And then she couldn‚Äôt get the speculum out!!! She kept tugging at it and saying ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs odd your body just sucked this up there‚Äù
She kept telling me to relax (which in this circumstance triggered me) and I had a panic attack and it did not help.
I was so embarrassed by the whole thing. 
When I got home I checked her medical notes and she wrote I have ‚Äúvaginal pain‚Äù‚Äî I don‚Äôt but it does hurt when my cervix is poked. She alluded to me having vaginismus, which I‚Äôve never had, just her fucking appointment traumatized me.

long story short i had unprotected sex with a rando in late september, and from october to february i had non stop BV and yeast infections back to back to back. every time i‚Äôd do antibiotics, the yeast would get worse, & every time i‚Äôd do antifungals, the BV would get worse. finally i went to my doctor and she prescribed me what she calls the ‚ÄúBomb‚Äù LOL. here‚Äôs her exact words:

Metronidazole by mouth for 2 weeks and boric acid 600mg suppositories (Azo brand) at night before bed for 3 weeks.

i followed this to a T. also:
- i took a vaginal probiotic once a day with 25 billion CFUs (at least 2 hours after antibiotics) 
- i only had protected sex with my boyfriend so i wouldn‚Äôt get any more bad bacteria
- i changed my body wash to a ‚Äúfeminine wash‚Äù that was unscented 
- showered immediately after workouts because in the past i‚Äôve been bad at that
- wore non-thong underwear most of the time

one week after i finished my antibiotics and finished my boric acid prescription, the BV was GONEEEEE. completely. i almost cried i was so happy. and my doc told me it should stay gone as long as i put in a boric acid after every period and after every time i have sex. every time i feel a little itch during the day i use a boric acid just in case (once a week or so, i‚Äôm overly paranoid lol). and i‚Äôm still taking the probiotics each day. it‚Äôs been almost 2 months and i have had ZERO odor üòç

zsapqq,WomensHealth,1671679363.0,"I, 28f, recently decided I should get tested for PCOS, thyroid and other health issues once a friend told me that I had all of the symptoms of PCOS and struggle to lose weight. My friend recommended a few doctors (one being an obgyn). I decided to make an appointment but the main doctor was booked out for around 4 months, however, her PA was available the same day. I accepted the appointment and showed up at the office. Let me start off by saying, that I am in no way religious. I think religion and medicine should be completely separate, but am wholly accepting of whatever anyone wants to be. I did not know until I was taken to an exam room that it would be surrounded by religion (Christian music playing in the background, painting of Jesus on the walls, anti-abortion stickers, etc). As a non-religious person, and with an anyone-can-do-whatever-they-want-as-long-as-they‚Äôre-not-hurting-anyone mentality, I was a little taken aback. Anywho, I meet with the PA and she starts asking questions about my sexual history. Am I sexually active? Ever had an STD? How many partners I‚Äôve had? Once I disclose how many partners I‚Äôve had (which is less than 25, more than 10), she proceeds to say ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to talk about chastity.‚Äù I laughed because I thought it was a joke and said ‚Äúlike, abstaining from sex? Why on earth would I do that? Especially if I‚Äôm safe about it and use protection?‚Äù She didn‚Äôt give an answer and I firmly told her that I had zero interest in talking about chastity or anything else similar to the topic. At the end of my visit she said ‚Äúsee? I didn‚Äôt talk about chastity.‚Äù
As someone who is super open about life/experiences/issues/etc, especially when it comes to a medical professional, am I the only one who finds this to be just completely strange? 
At one point (with a whole lot of Jesus‚Äô staring at me), I asked if I needed to be religious to attend this practice and she said ‚Äúno! Of course not. We cater to all types.‚Äù 
Anyway, my question is, was mentioning chastity a normal line of questioning? After doing some more deep diving, I found out the practice is very rooted in catholic religion, with most folks saying the doctors prayed with them after the visit. 
Obviously, this isn‚Äôt a good fit for me, but is there anything unethical or wrong about judging me for how many people I‚Äôve slept with/mentioning something religious during a visit? It certainly seemed like she was judging the number of people I‚Äôve slept with. 
Or am I in the wrong because for all intents and purposes, this was a practice with deep religious beliefs, and I didn‚Äôt know? To be honest, I wasn‚Äôt even aware a medical practice could have such blatant beliefs.

My period had sort of tapered off for a couple of months which worried me but I assumed it was due to stress. I got my period back but the pain was intense causing me to stay at home for days on end. Suddenly, I was experiencing the same pain but outside of my actual period which lead me to believe I was PMSing. Two days later, no joke, I am curled on the ground unable to move, sobbing my eyes out in the worse pain imaginable. Like the most intense pain I've ever experienced. This all happened after I was sent away from my clinic three times with some Advil and a hot pack. 

Went to the ER and after an ultrasound, they told me I had two gigantic cysts twisting my ovary. Some ovarian cysts resolve on their own but dermoid cysts, like the ones I had, had to be surgically removed. Some surgeries to remove these cysts are less invasive than others but ultimately I was left with a C-section-like scar.

As someone with PCOS who gets a host of issues during my period (the worst of which being a weakened immune system), I discovered there was actually no reason to put myself through it because my birth control allowed it

First of all, the ‚Äúperiod‚Äù you get from birth control pills is actually withdrawal bleeding. It is not the same as a natural menstrual cycle, and rather an artificial simulation of a period (and therefore NOT medically necessary).

We've been together for about a year now and things are great expect for the smell of her vagina. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know a ton about how the vagina works or what it's supposed to smell like (I've had no other partners) but her scent doesn't seem normal. On a good day, it'll smell a bit like strong onion-y BO but on a bad day.... I don't know how to describe it other than poop. It smells like if I stuck my face in someone's butt and they didn't wipe well. 

At first I thought it was maybe her hygiene after a trip to the bathroom needed improvement but I've been back there and it's fine. I notice the smell the most after my fingers are on or in her and it can be a bit hard at times to be excited to perform oral sex on her. The smell also lingers on my fingers sometimes after a wash. I'm also starting to get concerned that something is wrong and she may need to see a doctor.

I have yet to bring it up because I can usually just power through and if something was up surely she would know before me but now I'm realizing that I'm just putting myself in a worse position by not. I'm starting to at times not want to be physically intimate with her because of it and the longer I don't say something I think the chance of hurt grows exponentially (something I wish I had realized earlier but nothing I can do about that now).

So I guess my question is, how can I bring this up? Should I bring it up? Should I mention that I've done internet research and point her to resources?

1872t5a,Healthyhooha,1701298966.0,"I (21f) recently had my annual check up with my doctor and she informed me that if I want to have children in the future I will need to stop taking my hormonal birth control pills by next year. Next year would be my 5th consecutive year of taking birth control. 

I‚Äôm somewhat concerned about other birth control methods such as condoms and stuff but my biggest concern is my periods. 

The reason I got on birth control is because I had extremely heavy and painful periods that would cause me to overheat, get tunnel vision, go blind, and faint (in that order). The only other way to prevent this is to lay on the cold floor and not stand up while it‚Äôs happening. 

Not only is it painful and scary to be fainting and going blind, but this also interferes with my ability to work every time I‚Äôm on my period. 

I‚Äôve tried to get help from doctors about this before and have gotten a ton of tests done but everything comes back normal and birth control has been the only thing preventing this from happening. I don‚Äôt want to lose my ability to have children but I don‚Äôt know if I can handle the fainting and everything else that comes with it.

I‚Äôm not even sure where to start when it comes for asking for advice on what to do about this.

EDIT:
Thank you guys all for your responses. The general consensus seems to be that my doctor is either dumb or lying and I need to seek out a second opinion which I plan to do. 

I also have a lot of people bringing up Endometriosis and some other things to get tested for. I am rather sure that the reason I am fainting is because of Vasovagal Syncope. This isn‚Äôt directly related to my period pain but I think it‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing me to lose consciousness. That of course doesn‚Äôt address the source of my pain though. 
I will be sure to ask about Endo when I seek out a second opinion but I won‚Äôt deny I‚Äôm incredibly hesitant to get more testing done after the last time.

One of the studies \[[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3682672/)\] reported that a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù (62%) of women say insertion is about as painful as menstruation. This was not comforting to me because some people (myself included), have *very* painful periods. I pushed for a paracervical block and anti-anxiety medication when I had my IUD placed. I felt nothing and 100% would insist my doctor give me both again. 

I see questions about IUD insertion/pain at least once a week on this sub. And there are always at least a few comments saying, ‚ÄúYeah, it hurts soooo bad, but you will be ok.‚Äù 

**Let‚Äôs not say that.** 

If you are the lucky person who had an easy and (relatively) painless IUD insertion, I am happy for you. Or if you are just the the type to grin and bear it, I am a little in awe of you. But let's be honest, how many of us have heard IUD insertion is a walk in the park? And just because women have the fortitude to give birth doesn't mean we have to be ‚Äúok‚Äù with uterine pain in general. 

**TL;DR** will getting an IUD hurt? Most likely, but it doesn‚Äôt have to. You can and should share any concerns with your doctor. Ask about pain and anxiety reducing options that are safe and affordable for you. A good physician will work with you. If they push back, use a few legitimate studies to back up your argument (or look for a doctor who is more receptive to your needs).

I have been feeling really numb the past month. I don't know how to feel about the results of my own trial. I have had small moments of defeat, anger, frustration, but no strong emotions, which is weird for me because it's been a really difficult 2 years since he was charged. I have felt defeated in regards to women coming forward about the abuse and sexual violence they experience, and the law not doing anything about it. 

I remember feeling so shocked and grateful that I was even believed when I went to the police, and confounded when he was charged. It felt like the system was working. People were actually listening to me. They believed me. After a horrible relationship with this 'man' I left it assuming all responsibility for the abuse I experienced. It was incredibly validating that the legal system that almost always fails women and victims in this scenario was doing it's job. 

Over the course of the investigation and trial I came to largely regret ever going to the police. I try not to, but I am left with the feeling: ""For what?"" Being cross-examined and painted as the person responsible for my abuse by his lawyer was one of the most dehumanizing experiences of my life. Having to discuss the most intimate, traumatizing experiences of my life in front of a room of strangers was one of the most numbing, surreal, and humiliating experiences of my life. 

And for what?

I am left feeling like I can relate to no one. Aside from this horrible relationship, my life has unfortunately been marked with many traumatic events, and I just feel like I can't function as a normal adult as a result. I'm unemployed right now and am terrified of applying anywhere. I have become somewhat paranoid of meeting any new people ever for fear that they will be manipulative and/or abusive. Similarly to my abusive parents, bosses, friends, and intimate partners I've had. I have a good support network, and trusted people in my life that know about what I've been through. I have been talking to multiple counsellors over the past 2 years. But I still find myself feeling overly numb and unable to relate to people. 

I know I'm probably depressed, but the day-to-day is easier to handle if I use methods of distraction, and if I just try to ignore what's going on in my head. I have spent so much time and energy over the past couple years healing and understanding the things I've experienced, and often lately I feel like I'm talked out. I wish I could just move on, forget about it, and never think about it again. But more than that I wish it never happened. 

My abuser gets to walk around the world free from any consequences and I have to live C-PTSD, fear of intimacy, broken trust in others, fear of men, etc. I just don't know where to go from here.

kzaucg,Healthyhooha,1610905109.0,"For the past 3 years I have felt off. I had repeated bacterial vaginitis, yeast infections, and extremely painful pelvic pain. No doctor was ever able to tell me what was wrong, and why I had repeated infection and pain. All doctors attributed my pelvic pain to my IUD. I have many friends with them and they never had pelvic pain for more than a month after insertion, mine persisted for years. I also bled after sex, but was negative for all typical std‚Äôs that the OBGYN typically test for. The doctors will make you feel crazy, and belittle your problems, so beware of that and fight for yourself, you are your biggest advocate and don‚Äôt back down especially when it comes to your health! I eventually saw a specialist that prescribed me boric acid suppositories to insert for two weeks for my vaginal infections, and felt instant relief. But it turns out that relief was only a bandaid to an even bigger problem and that relief lasted for a short time. 

Fast forward to September 2020, and I started to develop UTI symptoms: urinary frequency, urgency, bladder pain, feeling like I wasn‚Äôt emptying, etc. i was having urinary symptoms on top of pelvic pain, and vaginal infections. I went to the doctor once a week for a month and all my testing came back negative for UTI‚Äôs, my doctors were at a loss of what was wrong. I had this UTI pain for almost 2 months it was AWFUL. It was really starting to affect my life, I wasn‚Äôt sleeping and I was very anxious. 

I had to advocate like heck for myself, I refused to back down because I knew something was really wrong. I found a doctor that was willing to order a microgen dx urinary and vaginal test. Turns out I was positive for ureaplasma parvum. I had a naturopath try to prescribe me natural things, so I ditched that doctor and had my primary care treat me for this. Find a doctor that you trust, and that is willing to work with you and not discount any of your questions or concerns. That is the hardest part is finding a good doctor. I went to at least 6 different OBGYN‚Äôs over the years, but none of them were willing to listen to me or think outside the box. My primary care immediately knew what ureaplasma was, and prescribed me 21 days of doxycycline to take twice a day and my partner took the same exact course which is crucial. My partner had absolutely zero symptoms but even if they do they should still be treated. No sex, no contact, no oral sex until you get retested again. My symptoms have completely disappeared after taking the full 21 days of doxycycline. I avoided dairy for 2 hours before and 2 hours after bc it affects the absorption of the antibiotic. It does cause serious nausea so do eat with some type of food in your stomach if you are prone to nausea. My primary care also ordered a CT of my kidneys bc I was having back pain, and it turns out I have unrelated gi issues as well, and a huge distention that the dr‚Äôs think could have contributed to urinary frequency. The dr‚Äôs still think most of the issues were caused by ureplasma, but some of that pain could‚Äôve been my gi issues as well. So get a doctor that is willing to explore all avenues, bc it may not be just the ureaplasma. I am now being properly treated for all of my health issues finally!


I am not here to give medical advice or tell you what to do, I am simply just telling you my story and hoping that this gives you some kind of hope. There is a lot of negativity on the internet regarding this bacteria. You never know how some people live their life, especially the people that have symptoms that never go away. You don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre engaging in sex with someone who has the infection, or if they didn‚Äôt finish the full course of antibiotics, etc. Don‚Äôt believe everything you hear on the internet. I hope my story can help at least one person out there! I believe the only reason I got through this infection was finding the right doctor to work with me and take me seriously. Take your antibiotics, abstain from sex until you and whoever you have sex with is negative, and then you‚Äôre free from this! I know lots of people have lingering symptoms, it may take 6 months plus to be completely symptom free, but if your test is negative and you still have some lingering pain, keep following with your doctor, it is not uncommon. I have twinges of urinary pain that last 30 minutes or so every few weeks, but it is nothing like the pain I felt every day when I was suffering with this.

yabv1n,WomensHealth,1666406157.0,"TW: sexual misconduct 

I (22F) spent a solid 12 hours in the ER 2 weekends ago. I was traveling with my boyfriend in an unfamiliar part of the country and we thought I had appendicitis. We went to the nearest decent hospital. 

Anyways, after many tests, it turns out I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured and caused significant internal bleeding in my abdomen. The ER staff called in an ultrasound tech and 2 doctors (OBGYNs) from a sister hospital. One doctor was a man (approx 30 years old) and one was a woman (slightly older than him).

For some reason, it was decided that the male doctor would do an internal pelvic exam. I definitely would have preferred the female doctor for this but I didn‚Äôt get a say. 

I (very stupidly) had my boyfriend leave the room because I didn‚Äôt know if he was allowed to stay and I worried he would be uncomfortable seeing me in pain and in such a vulnerable state etc. Then the doctor tells me to get undressed from the waist down, but doesn‚Äôt give me a gown or a sheet. So I was just naked from the waist down trying to cover myself with my sweatshirt when he and the nurse came back into the room. He apologized for this.

The male doctor and female nurse used the speculum and that seemed normal, however he then proceeded to stick his fingers inside me for several minutes with NO GLOVES. He was narrating this a little at first saying ‚Äúokay two fingers coming in‚Ä¶ oh actually only one!‚Äù kind of laughing, I‚Äôm assuming because I was very tight. I was really embarrassed and uncomfortable because it didn‚Äôt feel much different from being fingered in a sexual way (besides the extreme abdominal pain and psychological distress). 

I didn‚Äôt say anything to him in the moment. I decided to push it into the back of my mind until today, when I had a follow up with a trusted female OBGYN in my home city. My exam with her felt very different and more professional. I told her what happened in the ER and she was shocked and seemed kind of horrified about him not wearing gloves.

After hearing her perspective I decided to call a patient advocacy line and make a report. The woman on the phone was also deeply concerned. She said they would inform his supervisors and investigate immediately. I requested anonymity and she agreed. She kept asking me if I‚Äôm okay and I told her I don‚Äôt know. 

I just don‚Äôt know how to process this. He could have made an honest mistake, or he could have intentionally taken advantage of my extremely vulnerable state and sexually violated me. And I‚Äôll probably never know which one. 

I don‚Äôt know if this is even relevant, but I am a ‚Äúconventionally attractive‚Äù 22 year old girl and I work part time as a model. I have had a lot of experiences with unwanted and inappropriate sexual attention from men and so maybe I am paranoid and overly sensitive.

I'm just going to talk about some of the stuff I read, please correct anything you see that you think is wrong or that you believe I misinterpreted.

First question: is there a difference between a period and a menstrual cycle?

I kept reading about a menstrual cycle of some kind which supposedly lasts \~4 weeks, with a decent amount of variation, but I also an article which stated that the actual flushing of the membranes, the bleeding part, lasts for about 2 to 7 days? Is this true? And if so, is it just a very small amount of blood that just slowly exits the body over this period of time? And does the word ""period"" refer to menstruation or the entire cycle?

I also read about how these menstrual cycles sometimes don't occur, and sometimes skips a month. Prior to this I always thought menstrual cycles were this kind of endless cycle that just doesn't stop until you lose fertility, but are there days when you're not in any stage of the menstrual cycle at all, other than when you're pre-pubescent/no longer fertile?

Thanks.

Edit: Do women use tampons for the entire length of menstruation, switching every so often, or are there times when a tampon isn't used (i.e. when sleeping, or something, idk).

13u9bml,Healthyhooha,1685303325.0,"I‚Äôm not sure where I can talk about this throughly once again, I have posted about it before but now I really feel like if I wrote about it and get others insight it would help me out.

I‚Äôm 26 female and I haven‚Äôt gotten the HPV vaccine. It came out when I was around 11 I think, so my mom refused it back then. Fast forward of my dad losing his job, family not having health insurance to go to the doctor followed by me going off to college and then Covid closing everything, I‚Äôm now on Medicaid and I guess I have the opportunity to get the vaccine or so until I turn 27 just to have to be covered by Medicaid.

I‚Äôm not sexually active and never have been due to personal reasons. As I mentioned in a previous post my obgyn and my now nurse practitioner that I just saw, highly encouraged me to get it or looked into it more. I felt like my nurse practitioner was REALLY trying to talk me into it. Heck I almost did the vaccine at her office but then chicken out at the last second saying that I need to think about doing so more.

I‚Äôm torn because growing up, my mother would talk about how the vaccine has lawsuits, of people getting autoimmune diseases from it, and even now how it does. My mom isn‚Äôt anti-vaxx, heck this is the only vaccine that I think I don‚Äôt have, but she has this belief and thinks that it‚Äôs stupid for me to get since I‚Äôm not sexually active or even have a boyfriend. I think now that I‚Äôm older she just keeps telling me that it‚Äôs up for me to decide. I want to protect myself, in case that day magically come as I don‚Äôt have control on what my partner has done or if they would knowingly have it, or heck if I get it from sexual assault if that happens to me (I‚Äôve read stories on how others got hpv from sexual assault and sadly been commented on in the past that i‚Äôll probably be sexually assaulted)

I‚Äôm also scared on how I would react to the vaccine as since I‚Äôve had Covid a year ago I haven‚Äôt been reacting to other vaccines that well. I had a tdap booster when I went to my last appointment and well, I had a stomachache and diarrhea for a day or so and my mom called me a whimp for having side effects to a shot. I feel like Covid really effected my immune system even a year later, and i‚Äôm scared for the future on that.

My nurse practitioner was also really encouraged it since again i‚Äôm 26 and supposedly Medicaid won‚Äôt cover all of the shots once I turn 27. So I guess I‚Äôm short on time as I would be able to get two shots at least, before I turn 27 depending on if I get an appointment in the next two months. 

I want to get it due to the comments from my doctors, my friends who have gotten the vaccine now it‚Äôs their 20s, and even stuff like the news encouraging others to get it, but again I have the fear of how will I react to it and the unknown of how it‚Äôll effect me in any way.

I guess I want some others thoughts or even wondering am I the only one who thinks this so much.

xvxf45,Healthyhooha,1664935082.0,"Yep..I'm certain I had bv years. I feel so embarrassed and awful that my past partners and current partner dealt with it. Although no one has ever said anything to me about it, I'm sure that it was noticeable during sex. Sadly, I'm only now getting a better grip on keeping up with my health by seeing doctors at 25. It feels like a milestone to be at a place now where I have a PCP, prescriptions, diagnoses etc. 

After years of abnormal (in my mind normal) discharge and vaginal odor, I finally went to a doctor to get swabbed. The smell got stronger over time and was an almost sour, sometimes slightly fishy smell. I think I was so used to it that it wasn't off putting to me, but I knew it was there. I also had a persistent itch, specifically on my mons pubis area that indicated an issue. I thought was due to dry skin or shaving/trimming. 

Once the results came back confirming it was bv, I was prescribed oral metronidazole twice daily for 7 days. Just after the first day, I noticed the smell I once thought was normal was gone! I was so shocked. It was so bizarre to not smell anything. 

Since completing the week of metro, I no longer have an odor or excessive discharge. I still get itchy on my mons, but not as irritating as before. The lesson learned is that if you notice a smell, go see a doctor right away! Even if you have a slight suspicion or doubt. 

I'm very much embarrassed and honestly sad to realize I was not taking care of myself for so long. But I'm here now, and will do better about checking on my hooha health.

wzdh01,Healthyhooha,1661634236.0,"I haven‚Äôt had a UTI in a long time up until two and a half weeks ago. About five years ago, I was in a long distance relationship and the first time my partner and I would have sex after not seeing each other for an extended period, I was prone to getting them and they would totally disable me. The sight of blood in my pee alone would make me seriously nauseous and that was far from the worst part. 

Fast forward and I‚Äôve been with my current partner for almost two years and I had never gotten a UTI from sleeping with him. Then, a month ago, he and I both got Covid at the same time. We were really sick for about ten days and the after effects are still lingering in terms of fatigue but we are generally recovering. 

However, two weeks ago, the morning after sleeping with my boyfriend, I awoke with an unwelcome, familiar feeling. Within a few hours, I was peeing blood and was in agony. Such a specific, horrible agony that‚Äôs really difficult to describe. Having just moved abroad and not yet having medical insurance in my new country, my boyfriend‚Äôs mother went out of her way to get me a prescription to treat it and after hearing about how much I was suffering (like crying in pain), his mother also managed to get a prescription for codeine tablets (10, 20mg pills). These SAVED me. 

Once again, this morning, I woke up nauseous and knew almost right away what was in store. I went to the toilet, smelled the familiar smell but didn‚Äôt see blood until later in the day. I had a low grade fever and wanted to scream! 

This time, my SO found a bottle of unused doxycycline in his medicine cabinet but the OTC pain meds just weren‚Äôt doing me any good. My boyfriend happens to have many close friends who are doctors and one very kind acquaintance helped by coming to our flat, confirming I was in pain, and prescribed the same codeine tablets. Once again, they are saving me from literally sobbing and writhing to pain. 

Firstly, I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs plausible that my recent Covid infection might have left my immune system weak and more susceptible to UTIs? But mostly, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm alone in thinking UTI pain is wildly under-treated and women are just expected to suffer through it for a few days while we wait for the antibiotics to work? 

I seriously don‚Äôt consider it mild pain and think a mild opiate like codeine in low doses and without refills is a totally fitting medication for the level of pain and discomfort. However, in the US, I‚Äôve never been offered anything prescription strength for the pain, only now that I‚Äôm abroad in a country with national healthcare am I given something that actually helps. Maybe it‚Äôs a matter of the opioid crisis in the US but man, UTIs require way more than Tylenol IMO.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/wzdh01/is_uti_pain_way_downplayedundertreated_in_the/,Is UTI pain way downplayed/under-treated in the medical field or am I just very sensitive?,Sexual Health ,114,87,0.99,seriouslydavka

o8btyl,Healthyhooha,1624717703.0,"This is very graphic and was one of the most difficult and shocking things to deal with. Usually, I am pretty on top of my hygiene down there, I'd wash daily and even several times in the shower/bath, use baby wipes, a shower head ect. Well, at least I thought I was on top of my hygiene. Anyway, I have a very small clitoris which is almost completely covered by my clitoral hood but I noticed a small stinging pain when touching the clitoris directly. To make it worse, I tried simulating the clitoris with small makeup brushes (Seriously, don't ask! Just wanted to try something new and copied some masturvation porn videos) and it hurt like hell and stopped. 

A few days later I just decided to examine myself down there and see what my actual clitoris looked like... then bam, I see several white bumps on there under the hood, some which looked almost glued on there. I googled it and was convinced that I had growths and then went down this rabbit hole and convinced myself that it was cancer. I had salt baths and still they wouldn't come off so I was convinced that I had lumps attached on the clitoris itself. Then, I called my doctor and they said its likely due to secretions and build up... they turned out to be right (I'll get to that later). Because of the soreness I was trying to figure out whether it was a sore, blister, pimple ect...

I was convinced that it went down as the spots/pimples/lumps looked less visible. Then checked again and pulled the clit hood further and there were a lot more... And to make it worse, I saw a thick public hair sticking out right under the hood at the top where there is an ultra tiny gap/hole right on top of the clitoris. At that point, I was convinced I had hair growing from there and that the ""spots"" were due to an ingrown and freaked out. Called my doctor again about the hair and she said to use warm water/a warm compress and that as long as it is not getting bigger or causing infection, it should be fine. I went from thinking that I was going to lose my clitoris due to cancer or this ""ingrown hair"". 

I thought I'd have to go to the doctor or nurse to have this hair removed so I had to do what I can to remove it...
I attempt again then the tiny bumps suddenly fell off and were white and solid... turns out it was a build up of smegma (Yuck, I know!).  So I gently cleaned the area with a baby wipe and got one of those thin tweezers to remove the hair poking out of that gap/hole on top of under the clit hood. It took ages and a ton of stretching to get it out, it was incredibly painful! It turned out to be 1 pubic hair from when I was shaving at several other bristles from what do ya know, the brush... 

My clit is now irritated but everything is clean. But I'm incredibly worried about the same happening again!

Anyway, the moral of the story is to pull the hood back FULLY! Because just looking at my vagina normally, everything looked fine. Even when I thought I pulled the hood back fully, I didn't notice the hairs stuck until later. So if you want to keep that area clean, make sure to pull it back as much as possible! 

Oh, and don't put brushes down there LMAO! 

I hope this helps and any advice on how to avoid this in future would be appreciated. Especially since the hood covers everything and due to the hole/gap right on top of the clitoris. I'm still shuddering over this experience but I'm thankful it wasn't anything serious!

I‚Äôd say part of it is that I‚Äôm a light sleeper and so snoring or movement from him prevent me from falling asleep or easily wake me up.  The other part is this almost ‚Äúsleep anxiety‚Äù.  I‚Äôll be lying in bed with him and I‚Äôll get these thoughts ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you just head to the couch now?  You know you won‚Äôt be able to fall asleep here.  Every minute you‚Äôre here is wasting time you could be sleeping‚Äù.

I‚Äôve tried breathing exercises.  I‚Äôve also tried Benadryl and NyQuil (I know, not the healthiest way to form this behavior).  My boyfriend and I don‚Äôt live together so we‚Äôre only sleeping in the same bed 2-3 times a week.  

I feel badly that he wakes up in the morning and I‚Äôm gone, down sleeping in the couch.  I also think it would be so nice to wake up next to him, but that‚Äôs a rare occurrence.

ismtwc,Healthyhooha,1600096604.0,"Tldr: Doctor making questionable choices that appeared to exacerbate the problem. I complain about fears of never having penetrative sex again.

...

I got my first yeast infection after a bubble bath on August 7th. The urgent care I went to did not examine me or culture the discharge. I was prescribed Fluconazole and took both doses as prescribed along with Monistat 3. My symptoms were cured-like white basically odorless discharge with itching and pain up into my vaginal cavity and some itching on my vulva. My symptoms lessened significantly with treatment, so I tried sex, but penetrative sex felt like ripping and burning inside of my vagina and especially on the back part of the entrance of my vagina. 

After having sex this one time, the itching increased and the same discharge returned. I went to my primary care doctor, but had already begun monistat 3 by the time my appointment rolled around. I believe I was on day three of that treatment so when they tested my blood and discharge, they couldn't find a bacteria, yeast, or STIs. The doctor said that this was most likely because the monistat treatment had worked. I wish I would have known not to use the monistat before going into the doctor. It seems like common sense right now, but the untreated symptoms are pretty unbearable. 

The doctor did not prescribe anything after that appointment and said to call back if symptoms came back or worsened. (At the time of the appointment, my symptoms were being well managed by the monistat.)

A couple days later, I attempted to have sex again and found it to be extremely painful just like the previous time. However, the next morning I did not get the weird discharge. The only concerning symptom that had gone worse was the burning pain inside of my vagina that I largely was not aware of outside of penetration. I then called the doctor's office and they got back to me with a prescription for amoxicillin (antibiotic) to treat BV. I was not happy with this prescription. The first half of this year I have suffered from UTIs over and over again and took antibiotics each time and never had a yeast infection as a result of the antibiotics. However, I had read that antibiotics can trigger yeast infections and because my vagina was so messed up, I was really wary of taking the antibiotics. But, to rule out BV, I started a 7-day treatment of the amoxicillin and within a day I had a full-blown yeast infection again. 

This time, I treated the yeast infection with monistat 7. I also emailed my provider back who was on vacation so it got routed to a different provider who said that I could take the amoxicillin, the monistat 7, and Fluconazole concurrently. As with the times before, my symptoms improved with the antifungal medications with the exception of pain in my vaginal cavity. I have also had milky pink spotting throughout this.

The day before last, I completed my amoxicillin treatment and yesterday was my last night of monistat 7 treatment. Today I take the second dose of Fluconazole.

Here is the part where I start hopelessly complaining. I am deeply in love with my partner and sex is a huge part of that connection. Previous to this, our natural 3 year cadence is sex at least every other day. This is so difficult for me emotionally and I don't know when it will end. I miss intimacy with my partner so much. It would be unthinkable for him to pressure me to have sex while I'm in pain so I feel supported through this, but also worried for the long-term effects on my relationship.

Has anybody had anything like this saga and were you able to have penetrative sex again? What are people's experiences with pain in their vaginal cavity after a yeast infection treatment? 

I want to have hope that things can heal and go back to normal.

f5tzso,Healthyhooha,1582041966.0,"I wanted to post my story only because I haven't seen much about this on this page, and I went through 2 years of this before I got an answer.

A little over 2 years ago, a ton of things in my life all changed at once. Also during this time, I started feeling a slight itch, only on the left side of my vulva. Nothing too bad, but enough for me to notice it. I then got a bartholin cyst on that side, which went away after a few sitz baths and was gone by the time my gyno appt came around.

I went to the appt anyways about the slight itch and was told I tested positive for BV, and was given antibiotics. She also told me to get some cortizone cream to help with the itching. Not only did the itch get worse after the antibiotics, I now had a bunch of tiny bumps forming, still only on the left side of my vulva. So I head back to the gyno.

I'm told the bumps are harmless cysts, and I am still testing positive for BV. I also have internal cysts so I have not one, but 2, biopsies done on my cervix. I am given more antibiotics and sent home.

Biopsies all come back normal, but I am still testing positive for BV. The itch has gotten worse, but the doctor can't see anything wrong where it itches. The cysts don't itch, they just surround the itchy patch. It also started becoming painful down there, like I couldn't sit on hard surfaces for long periods of time.

She offers to do a biopsy of the itchy area even though there is nothing there and I say yes. She numbs me up and takes a piece and sends me home. (FYI, the itching did NOT stop when she numbed me, I was hoping for that!) After a day or so of healing, I take a look and she didn't even take a piece from the itchy area! I am mad. She then refers me to a specialty clinic in the next state over stating it could be nerve related.

4 months later my appointment date finally comes. The itching is crazy by now, I cannot sit for more than 10 or 15 minutes due to the pain. Right away at the new appointment, they can see what is wrong. It had gotten bad enough that my skin was starting to change color. Lichen Simplex Chronicus. Caused by stress. Who even knew something like that could happen down there! I now have a strong steroid cream I have to use every night, and a zinc cream I have to use everyday for the next 6 months and HOPE that it heals my skin. The cysts are permanent. I can have them surgically removed, but more than likely they will come back. And then preventative care for the rest of my life. This was caused by stress and can happen again anytime.

Since the very first day I started the prescription steroid cream, the itching has stopped! It's been a week now and things are finally starting to go in a positive direction. It's still painful because that skin is healing, but it doesn't itch! I am now in the market for a new gyno, and wanted to share my story so maybe someone else doesn't have to suffer as long as I had to. Please don't be afraid to push your doctor for results!

EDIT: The specialty clinic said I did NOT have BV, and probably never did. My original doctor was probably using the test strips which are not accurate!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/f5tzso/lichen_simplex_chronicus_keep_pushing_until_you/,lichen simplex chronicus - Keep pushing until you get a diagnosis!,,116,29,0.99,earthspirit1147
9vdjmi,Healthyhooha,1541708403.0,"First of all, I'd like to thank everyone that's been following my story. I'm glad it's entertaining some of you, and hopefully also encouraging anyone to get checked as early as possible if you're having weird symptoms, or to not give up on your journey towards a healthy hooha. 

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9v28k1/my_long_ass_hooha_story_part_1_the_time_an/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9v3snb/my_longass_hooha_story_part_2_inflammatory_pelvic/) [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/9vc1g6/my_longass_hooha_story_part_3/)

The Genetics doctor confirmed my diagnosis for Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich. I was supposed to make an appointment for a different day, but he took one look at my chart and I guess he didn't want to pass up on the opportunity to examine me since he prompted me to go in right away. He explained how the syndrome is formed:

Basically, when we are born, groups of cells form and they later become the respiratory system, and the circulatory system, and so on and so forth. The group of cells that became my reproductive system mutated somewhere along the way, causing my left kidney to either not form at all, or it was so small and useless the body reabsorbed it. It also caused my uterus to not form properly. In the beginning, the two cavities get together to form one big cavity, but in my case the cavities never got smashed properly, so that's how I ended with 2 cavities instead of one. Both cavities were separated by a septum. What I would later discover was that I had yet another septum across the left cavity which didn't allow the period blood to drain properly. The blood would go back up the hooha and develop the stupid blood sacks. If enough time passed, those sacks would get infected, hence all those abscesses. 

I was supposed to get a histeroscopy at that same hospital, but their histeroscope was broken and didn't know when it would get fixed. They recommended another hospital, and that's how we arrive to 2018.

It was 7 months of consultations and tests, including my first ever MRI, which was horrible, I don't recommend it. Anyhow, the doctors finally gave me a day for my surgery and expalined what would be happening. First, I was warned that there would be an audience. My case was just too rare not to witness, apparently. Second, they told me they'd get rid of the septum on the left cavity and if possible, the one in the middle of both cavities. 

Sidenote: If you remember my last ""emergency"" surgery when I got dumped with the women in childbirth and left me to die all night...the same sort of happened this time. I got wheeled down, prepped, and then dumped into an empty OR for HOURS. Doctors and nurses would come in and be like ""What are you doing here?"" And I'd be like ""WHAT THE FUCK DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING HERE"". They were backed up apparently, but I did finally got what I'm hoping is my last surgery. It was laser and there weren't many complications...other than all the blood I lost, but I didn't need a transfusion or anything. No, it was more fun than that. I had around 6 pieces of gauze balled up in my hooha! 

The next day I got my discharge and was told I'd be bleeding for like 2 weeks. The doctor removed the gauze, and FUCK DID THAT HURT. She inserted two more pieces cause I was still bleeding out a lot; she told me to lie down for a bit and then sit up and eat my breakfast. I was worried because I'd be leaving in a couple of hours and the blood would not stop pouring out, so I finally decided to just run into the bathroom and pee out as much of the blood as possible.

Let me tell you that this is the syndrome that keeps on giving. It just never stopped surprising me. I was expecting a fuckton of blood, but I was not expecting motherfuckin' clots that made me feel like I was giving birth to an alien. For the rest of that day I'd be expelling clots of all sizes and needless to say I spent most of it sleeping. It's worth noting that I almost legit passed out as I walked out of the hospital. It was the whole voices distorting in the backround, ringing ears, and dizziness. But after a day of blood clots and another day of getting my bowels to function again, I was able to finally relax as I healed. 

A month later, I can proudly say I'm not bleeding outside of my period and I no longer experience pain on my left side. I can exercise without worrying about smelly discharge messing up my underwear, and I can freely sleep without panties at night. I've gotten my Implanon to hopefully stop my periods or at least make them go by quicker because I am DONE bleeding so much out of my hooha. DONE. I've met a great guy and if all goes right, tonight will be my first time having sex free of blood and pain. I am just...happy. I'm 25 years old and I feel like I can finally start living.

But if I'm being completely honest, I'm mostly looking forward to get pregnant in the future. My future baby: I did it all for you.

we had gone out to get food and drinks, both had about two beer before heading back to the airbnb. we had talked about past friendships and relationships and during the bus ride home he asked me if a relationship was an option between the two of us. he admitted that what he thought to be a passing crush had developed into real love, and that he'd been debating telling me for a while now. i still don't know how long this has been going on, but he's been in love with me for half a year at least. 

i was so uncomfortable. i tried to convey ""no, never"" in the nicest way possible, but still making sure that i was not giving even the tiniest bit of hope. we were in a bus, on the way back to an airbnb, where we were about to sleep in the same bed, and i just pretended everything was alright. that night i googled flights home, didn't book any, and after still feeling very weirded out in the morning i texted my sister and scheduled an emergency phone call with my therapist. i eventually decided to get a hotel room to myself for the rest of the stay because i needed space.

i sat my friend down and let him know that i was leaving and we talked a bit more about his confession as i packed as quickly as possible. essentially he let me know that this had been on his mind for a long time, and he had made his peace with the possibility that a relationship would never work out. he was relieved when i rejected him very clearly, cause that gave him peace of mind.

i on the other hand was pissed because while he had time to come to terms with things, i had been completely surprised with the information. i am currently away from home, away from family, friends, or any other kinds of support, i'm in another country. and he thinks it's a good idea to ask me out while i am trapped with him. at least that got through to him, he cried and apologised for being selfish, but i'm genuinely at my wit's end. i'm fine to do the rest of my vacation alone, but right now i feel like shit (being in a nice hotel and having a hot shower definitely helped tho). how do i handle this friendship now?

The labia are on the outside of your body.
It's just near the vaginas entrance.

We all have them, and they come in all DIFFERENT
- shapes,
- colours,
- and sizes

For years I hated my labia. I was humiliated. I felt ashamed.

It didn't look anything like the ones in porn or magazines. 
Mine looked huge in comparison! I felt like a man. Completely stripped of all of my feminine confidence.

Please see below a link to the labia library... I recommend viewing it in a more private location, given the photos are very natural, very revealing, and very real. But they're beautiful, and more women need to be educated on, and understand what is real, and what is normal.

http://www.labialibrary.org.au/ 

Every woman's vagina is like a blooming garden, and it's about time we each become familiar with our own garden and start to love and embrace it.

It's normal, it's beautiful. 

People love it. No, not everyone will... 
Some people watch too much porn and have an unrealistic expectation of reality, others will have a difference of opinion. The same way we prefer different food, or outfits.

If you love your garden, and be confident in it, it will blossom. The right person will love it for what it is, because it's their garden. And if someone walks in and hates it so much they want to pull it all out and re-landscape, then they can take their business elsewhere!!

I HAVE GOOD NEWS!!!!!   
so after 2 years of battling what I thought was chronic bv, and hours and hours of research, I found cytolytic vaginosis. everything pointed you it so I bought a bunch of baking soda and was gonna start my baths. until I came across a post by someone 7 years ago saying she had my symptoms and was negative for everything but she tried the process of elemination and it turned out to be a yeast infection. She told me she did the 7 day monistat just to rule it out and her vagina has been normal since. So I wanted to rule out any infection before I tried the baths as well and I did the 7 day monistat. After a couple day‚Äôs I still found discharge so I got discouraged and was ready to do my baths. But day by day my discharge was less and less and it was getting more watery instead of thick. So I just monitored it for a week and I HAVE NO MORE DISCHARGE!!! Everything feels and looks normal again!! it still tastes a little sour so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs still balancing out every day but the discharge is 100% gone. I‚Äôm so happy that the day is Finally here.

This is the first period i have gotten since my birth control has begun, and so far i‚Äôm going on week 3 of my period. Recently, as in just a few days ago and today, i passed a decidual cast. my first thought was that my uterus had fallen out (because i heard that happens) but once i did my research i learned that it could be from my birth control. my mother is a nurse and she told me not to worry about things, and that it‚Äôs just my birth control thining out my uterus lining so that my bleeding can stop quicker, and future periods should be smooth. i‚Äôll attach pictures of my cast below. supposedly it‚Äôs a rare thing, and casts past in one go, well another piece had slipped out while i was at work earlier and i was sure to document it.

I‚Äôve been facing problems with my period for so long that i‚Äôm starting to give up and accept my fate, how i will never be able to normally have sex and how i will somehow always be in pain, i‚Äôll never keep any weight i lose off completely, i‚Äôll always be angry and in a shitty mood, and my bank account will tank a huge toll with all of the pads i have to constantly buy. I thought birth control would help me, and i‚Äôm hoping it does, but i‚Äôm getting discouraged because after you pass a decidual cast, the bleeding and cramps should begin to ease. everything calms down for around an hour and then it‚Äôs right back to terribly painful cramps and heavy bleeding. i‚Äôll have to go back to a doctor and all they‚Äôll do is shove birth control in my face again. does anyone have a solution? or go through something similar? what should i do? the fact that i‚Äôm not even in my 20s yet and i‚Äôm experiencing this just discourages me, i won‚Äôt ever be normal.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/14jb5qf,I‚Äôm pretty scared and i‚Äôm getting discouraged (19f),Period Question,112,43,0.98,None

Last week I had a very painful vagina area, felt like a bruise and it hurt to wipe. So I poked around a little and felt a large egg size mass at the opening of my vagina. Ok, google, tell me what it is. Bartholin cyst was the winner. Next day I went to the OB, they confirmed, numbed and lanced it. Two days later, it was back. I waited a few days then went back to the doctor, my worst fear came true, it was back. 

She numbed it and made a larger incision. She said it was bleeding a little and she‚Äôd put some silver nitrate on it to stop it. Ok. I get home and I‚Äôm in excruciating pain, I lay down and take some Advil but I‚Äôm shaking from how bad it hurts and it feels like gushing is happening. 

I stood up and looked in my underwear, a golf ball size clot fell out of me and I was actively bleeding down my legs. We called 911, I go to the hospital and I bleed throw two overnight maxis in an hour with more large clots coming out. 

A few hours and a lot of blood loss later, I get stitches to stop the bleeding. I thought I was dying that‚Äôs how much blood was coming out. 

Has this happened to anyone else? It really messed me up emotionally.

vygg71,WomensHealth,1657752966.0,"I was just wondering what other women had to say about my current predicament and if it's worth bringing up with my doctor.

I have a male GP and I have no problem discussing anything and everything with him. I know that he's a professional. He's especially great for me since I live abroad now and he used to work in the UK (where I'm from), so communication is much easier than previous GPs I've had in this country.

I had a copper IUD placed in the UK a year ago, it was going alright but recently I've been having complications and I need it removed ASAP. I called for an appointment to remove it and asked if it would be possible to have a female doctor as I'd be more comfortable with that. The receptionist started badgering me about why I wanted that. I just repeated that it was something I'd more comfortable with. Eventually she asked ""I don't understand the problem. Did he DO something to you?""... Not sure why the receptionist is being so weirded out and upset about the request and also what a strange thing to ask a patient over the phone but anywayy...

She asked the female GP at the practice and she refused to do it (something about not wanting to be stuck with all his female patients when they require intimate procedures?). I asked if there was any alternative and she said no and told me to find a new doctor or let him remove it.

Well, since I'm having a really rough time with it right now I feel pretty much cornered into letting him remove it and I'm now ten times more uncomfortable with the whole situation. All the phone calls and back and forth felt really confrontational and they were acting like I was insane for even asking.

I'm going to get it removed tomorrow because I'm desperate and I'm wondering if I should mention the whole ordeal with my GP and that I found it quite unprofessional and upsetting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/vygg71/asked_for_a_female_doctor_and_they_refused_and/,Asked for a female doctor and they refused and badgered me about it,Support/Personal Experience ,113,21,0.97,Layla_Vos

s20c9a,Healthyhooha,1641972267.0,"**Obligatory apology for length. I will also warn that this post includes details of my medical history, specifically vaginal health issues, and mention of SA**



I don't even know where to start.

I  miss not being aware of my genitals, more specifically my vagina. I was  only worried about the aesthetics of my vulva, trimming my pubic hair,  learning new ways to bald myself. I was just trying to make viewing it  pleasant for myself, and potentially a partner in the future.

I  never had any vaginal issues until I was sexually assaulted in October  of 2020. After that I got my first yeast infection, which last 10-14  days. Over a week of the worst, burning, itching, and general discomfort  I've ever experienced in my life. I didn't have insurance at the time,  so I suffered through at-home treatments hoping for something to work.

I  got over it, and everything seemed fine. I slowly became less aware of  my vagina again. In May of 2021 I was contacted by a past partner (who I  was seeing briefly from February to April of 2021), letting me know he  tested positive for chlamydia and that I should also be tested. I tested  positive with no symptoms that seemed related. I had increased urinary  frequency, but I had started drinking 2-3 liters of water a day (double  or triple what I would normally). I had discharge, but nothing alarming  about it, just white discharge with no smell. I was treated, and  retested a month later to confirm treatment was successful. Wonderful.

Fast  forward to September. I had a ONS, and I became increasingly paranoid  of him giving me something (I'll note here that being SA caused me to  lose impulse control, so I have never been good about insisting on  condom usage, I am sterile so pregnancy isn't a concern). I went in a  few weeks later, as I began having a very noticeable smell and milky  discharge. I had a full panel done, as well as a wet-prep to test for  yeast, BV, and trich. BV was the winner. After a course of antibiotics  that sucked the life out of me, I was all better.

Or  so I thought. I was eating better, drinking tons of water, feeling  really good about my vaginal health. I had a new partner starting in  November, and in December developed another yeast infection. This time I  was able to get in with a doctor where I was prescribed diflucan to  treat the YI (had a full panel done again). After about a week and a  half, I felt the infection had cleared up, but I was still having  irritation at the vaginal opening, burning as well with  insertion/penetration (attempted sex, had to stop) and some discharge.  There was no odor.  I was rechecked for yeast, BV, and trich. everything  came back negative and I was told to try boric acid.

Ever  since I have become hyper aware of my vagina. Every slight tingle,  every potential burning or itching sensation, every drop of discharge. I  frantically google what discharge is normal, what may be an infection. I  am not someone who has a history of discharge, aside from during  ovulation where I get a sticky blob of clear discharge when I wipe. I  have become paranoid that no matter what I do I am going to trigger  another infection. I have become scared to engage in PIV in case it is  triggering infections. I smell the toilet paper every time I wipe to  ensure there are no changes. I touch any discharge that is in my  underwear or lingering on toilet paper to assess texture.

I  don't know what to do or how to cope, I don't want to be constantly  thinking about my vagina's existence. Is this what being in a female  body is? I've always said the female body is a trap. It's so nice to  look at, to touch, to feel, but it is so finicky and complicated.

This woman made me wait the first time I had an appointment with her (mandatory to ""counsel"" about getting the IUD) for about half an hour. No apologies, no nothing. I sat in the waiting room wearing a mask during my lunch break for half an hour waiting for her highness to show up. But no big deal. I get it. Healthcare staff is busy, appointments run over, no bother. I understand.

Today was my appointment to get the IUD fitted with her. She only does it during your period. Great. Call 2 weeks ago, sorry, no, she's on vacation until today. Awesome. My periods last 2 weeks anyway so I figure that's grand, get it today then, her first day back.

The taxi cancelled after saying it was on the way. Tried to find another ride. Managed to get one but would be late. Called the clinic letting them know as a courtesy. They said it was probably fine.

2 minutes away from the clinic I get a call saying the nurse had left. She's strictly by appointment only. No warning she'd be leaving, didn't even bother telling me herself. Nothing. The whole drive was completely for nothing. 40 minutes down the drain. 

So to the nurse who has no problem letting her patients wait for her half an hour every day, barely apologising for it and of course never giving any notice and letting you sit in the waiting room during COVID for half an hour:

Go suck a cactus.

I'll just wait another month until her highness deems me worthy of her time. Another month of 2 weeks bleeding, wanting to die. But sure, why wait the way you made me wait you absolute fungi. Especially since I know I'll have to wait for her next time I'll see her! Another day to take off, hoping this time she'll maybe see me (but certainly not on time!)

m2fquo,Healthyhooha,1615429766.0,"This past weekend, I had a colorless under-the-skin bump that had been bothering me. Actually, I think the bump had been forming since earlier that week, maybe around Wednesday. I had shaved a day or two before & assumed it was because of that. 
It wasn‚Äôt until Saturday or Sunday that it started to feel really irritated. It seemed inflamed, but still under the skin. No head, no blister. The same day, I noticed that it hurt to pee but I get UTIs often & my urethra seems to be easily irritated even without infection, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. I thought it was an ingrown hair, messed with it (bad I know!) & noticed later that it left a tiny ulcer.

Monday, I noticed that I formed two more similar spots, but much smaller. They didn‚Äôt ulcerate, but they did get crusty. Throughout the day, I started feeling like shit. Leg pain, back pain, deep vulva pain/soreness, swollen lymph nodes, flulike symptoms... all of the typical first-outbreak symptoms. 

I recently ordered a full panel including a herpes blood test, so I went ahead & got that done. However, I know that herpes can take up to 6 weeks to show up on a blood test. I did an online appointment to get anti-virals yesterday & scheduled a gyno appointment for today so that I could get it swabbed. I had pretty much already accepted that it was herpes (upsetting, but not the end of the world!), especially since my partner gets frequent cold sores. 

However, because I didn‚Äôt have any blisters, & because the first bump seemed to be an under-the-skin irritation that slowly grew (& it‚Äôs still inflamed underneath the skin), I was worried it might actually be a bacterial infection. I‚Äôve had staph before & know it can cause similar symptoms. This would honestly be scarier than herpes to me because staph can literally eat your skin. My mom told me she got staph on her vulva from shaving before & it also gave her sores & swollen lymph nodes.

Another strange symptom is that my inner labia has been extremely pale throughout this whole thing (I‚Äôve been looking at it with a magnifying mirror like a million times a day). I‚Äôve tried googling this & I haven‚Äôt found anything about herpes causing your entire labia minora to whiten. 

My gyno was in a rush because he had to deliver a baby. I get it, but I would‚Äôve preferred they rescheduled my appointment. He came in, grabbed a speculum, inserted it immediately & very fast (ouch!!!!!!), & said he was doing a Pap smear, chlamydia/gonorrhea test, & that he could tell just from looking that it was herpes. When I started to mention that I had gotten a blood test but wanted to get a swab & be sure, he seemed annoyed. He said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need a swab or even a blood test ‚Äî it is 100% my clinical opinion that this is herpes.‚Äù & that was that. Never mind that I didn‚Äôt need a chlamydia/gonorrhea test, as I had just told them I had gotten a full panel. I didn‚Äôt even have time to explain my symptoms or ask about the discoloration.

It was so rushed, upsetting, & painful, I almost cried. I think he assumed I just couldn‚Äôt accept that I had herpes & was wasting his time asking for a test. I ended up going to the urgent care to get swabbed, where the doctor was much kinder & told me that it didn‚Äôt look like herpes & while it could be, she was going to prescribe antibiotics in case it was a bacterial infection.

k0rxc8,Healthyhooha,1606309902.0,"I turned 30 this year and got a new partner. After about a month, I was plagued with a UTI about 1-2 times in a month. Usually paired with a yeastie from the antibiotics. I spent over $600 in urgent care and video Dr. bills. It was bad. I thought I was allergic to lube, his particular jizz (which one doctor said happens more frequently than expected), underwear, tap water. I tried so many things. But alas, e coli in my uti everytime, which typically means that yes, poop got in the urethra somehow. 

I was taking 9 500mg d mannose a day, cranberry pills and drinking half my weight translated to ounces in water a day. Still got a UTI.

I finally went to a Urinary specialist and they took a direct pee sample through catheter of my bladder. More e coli. 

Basically she told me, stick with the d Mannose and even though you think no poop is getting near there, it is. 

So I finally now have made it to the month mark with no UTI and this is what I started doing...

Before sex, quick wash with unscented soap and water on outside vag and butthole. After sex, pee and same quick wash. 

Everytime I poop, I use unscented baby wipes and toilet paper AND do a quick unscented soap wash if I'm at home. No more thongs, they can move the poop particles, even cotton ones. 

I change my bed sheets now as recommended by the doctor every 3 days. I never re-wear jeans or pajama pants anymore.

Hi everyone. I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôm allowed to do this, and I don‚Äôt even know if anyone would care to read it, but I wanted to let you know what happened after my original post. You were all so supportive and wonderful to me and this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve been able to talk to anyone in my real life about, so here goes.

After reading the responses to my post it took me a while to build up the courage to call my local records centre. They told me how to formally request information, and it took a long time to build up the courage to take that step. Each next step from there on was terrifying for me because I was afraid of what I would find, or even worse, what I wouldn‚Äôt find.

Finally, a few days ago, I had a package in the mail with my full operative report and all surgical documentation. I‚Äôm not trained in the medical field, so I googled a lot of terms from the smudgy pages that were barely legible between clearly having been faxed and the terrible handwriting. I just wanted to find something that explained what happened to me. I didn‚Äôt find anything and just felt defeated, like I‚Äôd never know.

Today I was getting ready to file away those documents and decided to look through them once more first. On the operating room nurses‚Äô notes I noticed that one of the medications they listed as administered, Voltaren, was listed as ‚ÄúPR‚Äù under the section for route, while the rest were IV. A quick google search told me that means ‚Äúper rectum‚Äù. I am completely certain that it was put into my vagina due to the location and type of the discharge (or remnants, I guess) I found in my underwear, so I can say with as much certainty as I could hope for in this situation that they unnecessarily went into my underwear instead of administering drugs via IV while I was unconscious and put a rectal suppository in my vagina, then failed to tell me about any of it. I‚Äôll never feel like their actions were justified and I‚Äôll never feel like I was properly cared for, but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything more I can do.

At least now I know what happened. I still feel so completely violated, and so terrified at the thought of ever having surgery again. Still, because I thought I‚Äôd never know after getting these records I‚Äôm just relieved that now I do. At least that‚Äôs something on my side.

To all of you - the community here - I just want to say thank you. Thank you for telling me your stories and medical experience and opinions and helping to give me the push to look into this further. I don‚Äôt know that I would have done any of it without you. I don‚Äôt think any answer here would have made me happy because I‚Äôll never feel like I got justice for this breach of my trust and my body, but it‚Äôs better that I know. I wish I could express what your contributions in this process meant to me, so thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/qmqkhj/update_is_it_normal_to_have_someone_insert_a/,UPDATE - Is it normal to have someone insert a vaginal suppository while a patient is unconscious after surgery and not tell them?,,113,28,0.97,throwaway184256
oyvib2,Periods,1628209319.0,"My sis started her period early this year. It was very surprising to me and my mom bc she‚Äôs so young. She didn‚Äôt even tell us. We just found bloody underwear and sheets in the laundry one day. 
She was trying to ignore it, she thought it would go away. 
And when my mom tried to have ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù with her she refused to listen and kicked her out of the room. 
After a couple times of trying to talk to her she finally got her to use pads. Still she won‚Äôt talk to her about it. 
Once she asked my mom how long having a period will last and when my mom told her ‚Äútil your my age‚Äù my sis started balling. 

But now she‚Äôs getting‚Ä¶very aggressive. 

See today, she went to the bathroom right before I did and I noticed there was a bunch of blood stained paper rolled up  in the toilet and didn‚Äôt really think anything of it. once I was done doing my thang(#1 btw) and flushed the toilet, it erupted and flooded the bathroom floor. 
So my first thought was she probably tried to flush a pad and didn‚Äôt know any better bc she refuses to listen to anyone.  
When I tried asking her about it she starting shutting down like usual. So my mom tried to talk to her while I cleaned the floor. And she told her to shut up, kicked her, and told her to leave her alone. 

My mom and I don‚Äôt know what to do. 
I‚Äôm worried she might‚Äôve been SA or something bc I‚Äôve heard that SA can jump start your hormones and your period and I don‚Äôt know why else she‚Äôd react this way. I‚Äôve never heard of or seen this type of behaviour regarding periods

(Also she does have a history of aggressive behaviour, she was very aggressive/violent once my mom and her dad split when she was 3 and I was 13. But she grew out of it)

mmmstw,WomensHealth,1617868345.0,"(Background: Prior to this I had the exact same copper IUD for 4 years with absolutely no problems).

This all began when I had my old copper IUD replaced with a new one (a 5 year copper IUD) in mid February of this year. The procedure was very simple, the doctor simply pulled the old one out and inserted the new one. There was a little bit of pain but it wasn't too bad and the whole thing took less than 20 minutes. I felt great as I left the clinic as I had such a positive experience with my previous IUD and assumed it would be the same this time.

Unfortunately, things started to take a turn when I had my first period. I knew it was coming as I could feel the cramps starting so I prepared myself for quite a heavy flow (to be expected and completely normal for the first few months after IUD insertion). Because I expected this, I was quite prepared in that I was wearing a GIGANTIC pad and had a spare one in my bag. My period, however, seemed to be quite light. I continued with my day thinking maybe this time around it wouldn't be as heavy as my first IUD. I finished work and was on my way to do an exam, for which I had to travel on public transport for about an hour and a half. First I had to take a bus, then 2 trains. I stood up to get off the bus and that's when I felt it. A sudden GUSH of blood. I panicked but kept walking towards the train, hoping to find a bathroom. There was no bathroom. I looked around and couldn't find anywhere I could go and sort myself out. So I decided to get on the train for the 10 minute journey and hope there would be a bathroom on the other side. There was no bathroom. Again, I reassured myself and decided to just check when I got to the exam centre. As soon as I arrived I ran to the toilet. As I sat down, huge blood clots the size of three fingers came out as well as huge amounts of blood. My underwear and a good part of my jeans were stained red. I changed my pad and ran to 7-eleven to get supplies to clean up. Luckily I was wearing dark blue jeans and a black hoody that covered my bum. In the toilet again, I cleaned up as best I could and had to run to make it in time for my exam. 

Once in my seat for the exam, I felt the gush again, and again and again and again. I knew it had soaked through. I sat as far forward on the edge of my seat as I could so I wouldn't leave a stain on the yellow chair. Next, I had to move to another room (to prepare for the speaking exam) and I tried my best to cover myself as I was led there. In the next room, I did the same thing and tried to sit on the edge of my seat. I knew I had left a small stain and was so horrified. I asked the invigilator if I could go to the toilet and she said I would receive a penalty. I then had to go to ANOTHER room where I had to sit outside on one chair (leaving a stain) then go inside and sit on another chair (leaving another stain). The invigilator who led me there knew rightly what was happening. As I looked her in the eye and asked to go to the toilet again for this emergency, she told me no once again. Then she took a piece of tissue and went to wipe the seats down. The amount of blood that was coming out was more than I have ever experienced. A pad for a very heavy flow lasted about 30 minutes before it was soaked through again. I got through my exam and ran to the toilet again but I had no way of hiding it this time. I tied my hoodie around my waist and took a cab home. In the 40 minutes it took me to get home, I had once again soaked through my jeans and through the thick hoodie. 

Because the blood loss was so much, I was a bit concerned and went back to the clinic to ask if there is any problem. I could only meet with the nurse who told me we should do a blood test to check my iron levels. Then we made an appointment for 3 weeks later to see a doctor and discuss the results. At no point did the nurses explain to me that there was a chance my IUD could have been expelled, nor did they perform a pelvic exam, which I believe is procedure. 

Three weeks later I go to see the doctor, who tells me my blood test is normal and gives me some medicine to control the bleeding for my next period. I leave the room feeling relieved until he suddenly calls me back in and asks if I had a pelvic exam last time to check my IUD is in place. I told him I hadn't, to which he looked surprised. He performed a pelvic exam and said he couldn't see the strings and that I'd need to have an ultrasound. To my horror, the IUD was not seen in the ultrasound and had in fact been expelled. The doctor explained that I could be pregnant and gave me emergency contraception, despite me telling him I have been having regular sex with my partner for the past 3 weeks, unaware that I had no IUD! He told me to come back in 3 more weeks to have a pregnancy test. 

I already knew at this point that, if it did turn out I was pregnant, I am in no position to keep it and would be requesting a termination of the pregnancy. 

A week later I took a home pregnancy test and it came out positive. Distressed and upset, I immediately went back to the clinic to have it confirmed and explain my circumstances. I have had an X-ray and one shot of the Pfizer vaccine in the past month, I was not aware my IUD had been expelled because nobody checked and I am in no state mentally or financially to have a baby. The nurse immediately asked if I wanted to apply for an abortion. Now I have to wait another 2 weeks to see 2 doctors so they can assess my physical and mental health and determine whether I'm fit or suitable for an abortion. The procedure comes at great cost and I am already experiencing pregnancy symptoms, which are impacting my daily life. Needless to say, I feel traumatised by this whole experience and I hope nobody else ever has to go through the same thing. 

I‚Äôd just like to reiterate that I had a 100% positive experience with my first copper IUD and, despite everything, I still think I will go back to it as my contraceptive method. In addition, (though it is not the patients responsibility to remind health workers of this) sometimes people are tired and mistakes like this can happen so if you do go for an IUD check up, make sure it‚Äôs actually in place. 

I have no hard feelings towards the nurses and doctors at the clinic as I know it was not intentional and they are so kind and helpful in every way when I visit. I get the feeling they know they made a mistake and they are now trying to help me as best they can.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/mmmstw/psa_an_iud_horror_story_long/,PSA: An IUD Horror Story (long),,114,33,0.97,larasiowa

i204dx,TwoXSupport,1596317021.0,"I had quite long hair (down to about mid-back) and I got it cut for the first time in ages yesterday. I asked for two inches off to get rid of the split ends, that was it. The hairdresser seemed...I don‚Äôt know, disappointed? Judgmental? So I said that I would be okay with a little bit of layering too, at the ends to make it lighter, since I‚Äôve liked that in the past. Second red flag I should have noticed was when he had me sit for ages with the conditioner on because ‚Äúyou need it.‚Äù Then, we started chatting, and I stopped really paying attention. He seemed like a nice guy. Plus, I have extremely bad vision without my glasses, and I always have to take them off before I have a haircut. I can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening as it progresses, so I basically have to trust the hairdresser.

Wrong move. My hair is shorter than my shoulders in the front, and heavily layered, to the point where I can barely put it in a decent-looking ponytail or braid. I hate it so much - every time I move my head I can feel that all the  hair I liked so much is gone. Even in the back it barely falls to my upper back. It frames my face in a way I really don‚Äôt like, since I‚Äôm extremely self-conscious, and it feels like the one thing I liked about myself is gone. The guy seemed so pleased with himself, and how ‚Äúnice‚Äù he made me look. He said he ‚Äúhad‚Äù to cut off more than we agreed because my hair was dry. 

I‚Äôm honestly kind of furious, but mostly at myself. I didn‚Äôt say anything to him - just thanked him, paid, and left. I convinced myself that I liked it, until this morning, when I saw myself in the mirror and cried. This is far from the first time this has happened to me, and I hate it so much. Part of me feels like I should never go to a salon again, and just learn to cut my own hair. Why can‚Äôt people just listen when it comes to something ON YOUR BODY?

So a couple of weeks ago I posted this: https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/8kd0di/recurring_yeast_infection_since_moving_in_with_my/
and you guys were so, so helpful I decided I'd do an update!

I managed to find Fluconazole (an oral treatment) in a pharmacy without needing a prescription (although the first pharmacy I went to asked for a prescription so I got very lucky with the second one!) I took one pill every evening for 7 days, and even by day 2 or 3 it felt much better. 

I was on holidays at the time, but since I've come home I've changed several things; when I have sex, I now pee within a couple of minutes of it being finished (before I was a little lazy and would wait longer) and I clean myself with baby wipes or shower afterward. I also change my underwear twice a day now, and when I shower I use toilet paper to dry there, as opposed to the towel I use for the rest of me. Since I started being more careful by doing these things, no sign of any infection and I feel way healthier down there!

I guess I'm just updating because this taught me a lesson about how important it is to look after your body, especially your vagina!

The last few years I've had to wear a thin pad everyday. If I don't, I feel like I peed my pants and by the end of the day, I smell a slight odor. The wetness used to also cause horrible chaffing in my inner thighs. 

I've brought this up to two different gynecologists and they couldn't give me any answers. I've never had a pap smear come back abnormal, and the doctors I asked about it just kind of shrugged and had no clue. I've been tested for everything like STIs and BV, but this started well before I was sexually active.

 It happened before I was on birth control, while I was on various oral pills, and it still happens the same now that I currently have an IUD. Nothing has changed the flow of wetness at all. 

I'd also like to add that when I have sex, it's also super wet. That part I'm not complaining about, but in normal everyday life it's very annoying and embarrassing.

b95o51,Healthyhooha,1554336135.0,"Hello y'all, 

So I am 23 years old and suffer from (or used to? Don't want to jinx myself!) chronic UTIs. They started when I was 19, first became sexually active and typically occurred at least once a month but usually more like 2 or 3. Oh, and on top of all of that, my bladder shrunk; I now have to pee at least every three hours, no matter how much liquid I've had. Lovely stuff!

My doctors and I (gynecologist, urologist, gastroenterologist, and my PCP) spent three years trying to figure out why I was getting recurring UTIs and couldn't go more three hours without peeing. We did ultrasounds, MRIs, XRAYs, probably hundreds of urine tests, and a urethral catheter test (I can't remember the correct term, but they would insert a catheter and take urine directly from my bladder). By all physical evidence other than my UTI pain, I was and am completely healthy! Nothing wrong, no STIs (STDs), no allergies (like latex or something else), no tumors, no kidney stones, nothing. No one could explain why I was getting UTIs so frequently, especially when my symptoms would start, my urine tests indicated a high number of bacteria, I'd go on 5-7 days of antibiotics, and bam. No bacteria at all. Even from the catheter exam. I had a standing prescription for antibiotics because my doctors were all just like ""...IDK. Crap. Sorry.""

But I haven't had a UTI in 6-7 months now! Why? The only thing that has changed is ***I don't sleep with underwear/shorts/sleep pants/etc. on. I sleep naked.*** Literally, this is the only thing that has changed. I got a concerned call from my doctor (whom I'm rather friendly with because of all the time I spent in her office) when I hadn't filled my antibiotic prescription for several weeks. I told her the change I made, and after some silence, she told me that while there's no scientific proof that sleeping without panties helps chronic UTIs, several of her patients have had the same thing happen when they began sleeping naked. 

I'm not a doctor. I'm not even a science major. I'm studying to be a History Teacher. This is only my experience, but I wanted to share because after all those years of pain (which doesn't even compare to others I've heard of) I wish someone had at least suggested sleeping naked to me. It was such an easy fix. Disclaimer: I have had 2 (**TWO**) UTIs since I stared sleeping naked about a year and a half ago. However, if I hadn't have changed my sleeping habits, I have no doubt that that number would be in the double digits instead of a simple, doable TWO. 

I hope this helps someone. No guarantees it'll work, but as I wasn't the only one this has helped, thought I should share!! Have a good (UTI free!) week!

zunrkh,Healthyhooha,1671932075.0,"I'll try to keep this brief. I'm obviously not sponsored or financially motivated to share this, it just helps me so much. 


I have struggled with yeast infections, UTIs, bacterial vaginosis, vulvadinia and vaginismus for almost my entire life, starting at about 6. I'm 20 now. I tried everything, conventional medical treatments, cotton undies, supplements, sleeping commando, being commando constantly, no pants, etc. Nothing worked long-term. I found a lot of relief through my fantastic doctors and overall being careful, but no matter what I did my issues would always come back. Up until recently, I had never experienced sex that was not at least a little bit painful.

I got another UTI, probably my 8th one this year about a month ago, and it was awful. I have been so frustrated, so tired, and so angry for so long, so finally I decided to try something I had considered in the past but never done. I bought a pack of men's cotton boxers.


Now hear me out. I know cotton panties are a big thing, but they still are tight and for me at least agitate me around the seams no matter what type I use. Since switching to 100% cotton boxer briefs from Amazon, I have not had ANY ISSUES. I sleep in them, wear them with normal clothes, etc. If I have to wear tight leggings in a professional environment, I will wear a thong, but I change immediately and I only use unscented baby wash for them when I wash them. Not only are these boxer briefs extremely comfortable, but they wick sweat very quickly, don't cause any agitation, and for the first time in my life I'm not constantly worried whenever I have sex, exercise, or get splashback on the toilet lol. 

Sure they aren't the sexiest thing ever, but frankly, it's a worthy trade in my opinion. Definitely at least worth trying! I wear a women's small and I got a men's xsmall for the boxers, I would say check the size chart because they're a little tight on me but still super comfy! I also cut the legs so they're a little bit shorter and stretched the elastic. I seriously cannot tell you guys how much this has helped! I recommend it 100%! Just make sure they're cotton and not some other type of fabric.

wimlal,Healthyhooha,1659897222.0,"Wasn't sure where to put this, but I hope I can help someone that might have the same issues I did. I had issues with BV and vulvodynia over a 4 or 5 year period and now I'm BV free and pretty much pain free.

I started out with BV in 2017/2018 and I was dismissed by my doctor saying it was a yeast infection and thrush. I tried all the caneston treatments and nothing was working.
I did my own research and realised it was BV because I had the awful smell. It was terrible and after a year I managed to go to a different doctor, they did a test and found it was BV. I took metronidazole which worked, but the BV came back after my next period. I took metronidazole another 2/3 times and the BV always came back after my period. I had had the BV for about 2 years now. 

I then started to have some pain during sex. It was small at first, but just got worse as time went on and my bf and I just stopped having sex as it hurt everytime we tried. I was tested for STIs twice but it all came back negative.

The pain was like a sharp burning intense pain around my entrance at first, especially the lower part. But then my clitoris and lips would hurt too. The entrance was the most painful part and when me, gynecologists or doctors touched it was the worst pain I've felt. I would be on the brink of tears during examinations and I had quite  from a few different gynecologists.

It started out hurting just when it was touched, like during sex, but then would hurt all the time. I was in agony and I was crying all the time and was so stressed about it. I was trying nappy cream to soothe the pain, but nothing worked.
I now know I had provoked vulvodynia at first which then progressed to unprovoked vulvodynia too

I went to doctors and gynecologists in my area and none of them really knew what to do. They gave me amitriptyline on 10mg which did nothing and the pain was reduced once I got to 30mg but it was still uncomfortable. However, 40mg made me feel dizzy and faint, so they swapped me to nortriptyline, but it made no difference to the dizziness and I still had the pain. I really felt like there was never going to be an end to this, it had been about 3 years at this point.

I decided to research vulva pain specialists and vulvodynia specialists. I found a vulval clinic in Durham (NHS County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation trust) and asked my doctor to be referred there. It took a while to get an appointment letter and it was a 4 hour journey from where I live, but I was willing to try absolutely anything at this point.
I saw a doctor at Chester Le Street Community Hospital and he told me to stop the amitriptyline as it won't cure the pain, just masks it. He explained that things like irritants or long term infections can cause vulvodynia, so I assume my BV was the cause, but I also used to use soap to clean my vulva which may have irritated it too, now I just use water.
He said that my nerves were extremely sensitive, so even a slight touch was registered as pain and I needed to desensitize them slowly.

He did an examination and gave me lidocaine 5% and told me to apply it 4 times a day and keep on top of the pain. I did that for 3 months and I couldn't believe that the pain was gone once I applied it. I put it on after I went to the toilet and as long as I kept on top of it the pain was gone. 
He also said to use it before sex, but at that point it had been over a year since my bf and I had had sex and I was scared and didn't want to have sex at all because it had hurt for so long. We did try a couple times but struggled as the provoked pain was kind of slightly inside by the entrance and it was hard to put the lidocaine in that area. I was also extremely tense and not relaxed which also didn't help.

At the next appointment he did an examination again and decided to do a biopsy to check my cells and also remove some scar tissue that was by my entrance which was the part that hurt the most to touch too. He numbed the area with an injection which did hurt, but the biopsy was okay. It was sore afterwards and it did swell quite a lot. I had to be careful how I sat down and walking for a while was uncomfortable. After about 3 weeks it was completely healed though.

The doctor also referred me to the pain management section in North Durham hospital as I was struggling to be in the mood for sex. I never thought about sex and just totally avoided it and everything around it. Even kissing my bf made me anxious as it used to lead to sex even though I knew he never expected anything more. I felt so bad, but I just got so anxious and nervous.

The doctor also gave me some dialators to help desensitize the inner area that still hurt a bit. He said to use it with the lidocaine and I was able to comfortably use the 2nd one and sometimes the 3rd, but only slowly. It was the moving and friction that often hurt not really the stretching. I used lots of lube too. The Yes Gel moisturiser is the BEST for lube. Doesn't dry out like others do.

When I went to the appointment for pain management at University Hospital North Durham I talked with a team of 3 female doctors and they were amazing. I felt so comfortable and they were so helpful. They told me to take everything off the table with my bf and just start so small. To be very clear that we need to be slow and nothing leads to another thing. This was all stuff my bf already knew and did, but just talking about it made me feel better and more relaxed.

I also told the group of doctors about my issues with recurring BV. They said that the metronidazole wipes out all the bacteria, so I need to make sure good bacteria is there too. I had used balance activ before alone and it didn't work to cure BV, but they said it's a preventative. They said to take metronidazole again and use balance activ bv treatment pessaries (get them for like ¬£9 in asda) after it for a week (I did 2 weeks to be safe). I then used balance activ again for a week after I finished my period. I did that for the next 3 periods and it never came back!! (Touch wood) I occasionally use them maybe for one night after a period or if I notice an odd smell, just to be safe.
I also drank a glass of cranberry juice a day and still do just to help. I really think this made a difference too.

From what the team of doctors said the way I was using the dialators was in a clinical kind of way too. I was just doing it to desensitize and massage the pain away, not to feel good. The doctors said I need to use them in a more pleasurable way and to relax and enjoy it.

I had slowly used the lidocaine less and less. I used the YES moisturiser alongside it as I was quite dry. I also came off the pill due to emotional issues too, but I don't think it was linked to any of this. 

I also changed my mindset and used the dialators one night. I dimmed the lights, put on nice music and totally relaxed. and idk why but I decided to not use any lidocaine and it didn't hurt! I honestly could not believe it. I'm not sure if the doctor just managed to remove the painful skin when he did the biopsy and that combined with the regular usage of the lidocaine, but it didn't hurt! I was so happy I could have cried.
It took a while before I was ready with my bf, I was also super nervous still. He had been so amazing and supportive during all this. I am super lucky to have him.
It's been a year since then and we have sex more often now and I'm in the mood way more. There are still times of discomfort, but I don't freak out, I just try to relax and change positions. I sometimes use the lidocaine after my period as it's a bit sore after then, but only occasionally. My bf and I also communicate regularly about sex which really helps.

I honestly can't thank the doctors at durham hospital enough, they helped me so much and were amazing. Sorry this was so long, but I really hope that me telling all this can help other people who are going through the same thing. Feel free to ask me any questions about any of this :).

So I was in Costco, doing Costco stuff, you know how it is. At the end of a shockingly inexpensive trip I needed the bathroom and trotted off to do so. There was a sign that said ‚ÄòMale attendant cleaning‚Äô on the wall of the entrance to the female washroom. Now. I did a cartoon sliding stop mentally. A lot of things went through my mind: I need to pee!!! I‚Äôve been raped by a man. I work in Health Care just enter that frame of mind of ‚Äòit needs to be done‚Äô. Covid really has changed a lot of stuff. Are they legally allowed to do this? Do I feel safe? I NEED to pee. 
So I went in. I trust Costco, at least the ones in my city. They‚Äôve handled Covid well, they treat me, a paying customer professionally. I asked the male attendant if I was still allowed to use the bathroom. The man immediately made eye contact, had a pleasant face, smiled and said something along the lines of ‚Äòyou saw the sign on the door? Sorry! Because of Covid and short staffing we‚Äôre legally required to clean each hour with the possibility of a wrong gendered attendant OR shut down the washroom while it‚Äôs cleaned.‚Äô I said I understood and went to use a stall away from him. He spoke up right away and said ‚Äòthat one doesn‚Äôt lock‚Äô I cannot express how much I appreciated him being upfront about that. It was already an awkward situation. I‚Äôm going to be exposed with a man in the room. He WILL hear me pee. Having a door that locks was kind of important! He saved me the anxiety packed decision of walking out the stall to another one with him watching KNOWING why I left or the feeling of staying in a stall that didn‚Äôt lock with a man in the room. I did my business and he kindly made lots of noise with his cart. Once I was out I (that felt important too) started the conversation again with ‚ÄòCovid sure has changed stuff!‚Äô He apologised again and reiterated they had to choose between shutting down the bathroom or letting women choose if they were comfortable with a man in the room. 

Ladies. How does this strike you? It‚Äôs been on my mind ever since. Obviously some women wouldn‚Äôt be okay with this at all. I found myself asking myself ‚Äòwhat if your trauma was still very fresh? What if you hadn‚Äôt seen the sign and walked around the corner with no warning? What if?‚Äô 

All in all I was very impressed with how Costco had handled it. They clearly had chosen a very kind professional man to do it, had coached him on what to say and how to interact with the women.

OK, hear me out.

Sounds crazy, but since the beginning of August I have been having crazy issues I have never had before with recurrent BV and YI.

I was tested for all STI- negative. The doctors took samples, and on two separate occasions about 3 weeks apart confirmed BV and yeast.

I was doing everything. No over the counter yeast medication was working. I took about 15 Diflucans throughout all of this, 7 in a row.

I used boric acid for almost a month.

Then magically, two days after running out of my toilet paper, that I got at the end of July, a week or so before my symptoms started, the pain started going away.

All the burning, and itching, painful urination finally going away.

WTF.

He also has a psychological block as well, which he think is caused by the condom. So the last time we had sex, he brought up the idea of going on birth control so we could do it without a condom. I've never had sex without a condom with any of my partners. I've been on birth control before and I had SEVERE reactions to it, even when I tried different pills. Depression, extreme rage, mood swings, thoughts of suicide, and apathy. I'm not particularly open to an IUD because I have no medical reason to get one. I've been doing just fine with condoms for the past few years; I've never had one break on me or had any pregnancy scares.

azfoxo,Healthyhooha,1552224901.0,"Hi folks,

I've noticed that there's semi-regular posts on here with people struggling with shaving. I have just recently struck upon something which works well for me after a long time of experimenting (and suffering!) This post will be split up into parts, so if you want to skip ahead to the last section, do so.

****

##Backstory/history

I have very sensitive skin and fine hair. I also have mild pili multigemini. My skin is *very* prone to outbreaks and especially folliculitis, especially downstairs leaving me unable to shave without being punished for it. Often, I find that each shave progressively worsens my razor burn and folliculitis to the point that it becomes untenable to continue shaving.

And anyway, horrible razor burn and folliculitis is not a nice aesthetic so I always feel better off trimmed than looking like a plucked hedgehog, and about as angry too. This left me with trimming as my option given the circumstances. This works and avoids most of the problems I have with shaving, or at the least ameliorates them but it isn't ideal for me.

****

##What has worked, what hasn't


Here are some things which I have tried with shaving and my experiences:

###Pre-shave

* Hot water/steam

This absolutely works to soften the hairs. I wouldn't go without it.

* Shaving cream

This works well and I have found a body wash which makes a good lather and I tend to use it with shaving. You can buy a special shaving cream bowl and brush cheaply online if you want to do this. Or if your skin is fine with shaving cream in a can or special shaving soap then go with that. Though if your skin is prone to allergic reactions, in my opinion you're better off avoiding the fragrances and accelerants etc. in commercial shaving cream. Lathered soap/body wash seems to help me.

* Shave oil

This is something which is marketed towards men and beard-care, from what I can gather, but it is exceptionally good at reducing friction and razor burn. Where I live they market tiny little 1oz bottles for stupid prices ($8 or $15, I can't remember but it's ridiculous) and the main ingredient is sunflower oil or safflower oil with some fragrances and dyes. Guess what works just as well? Sunflower oil for the kitchen. It's the exact same stuff, except without any potential irritants. You could also use coconut oil. I would *not* shave without oil on my skin these days, even if I'm not using soap I cannot skip the oil.

###Shaving

I always shave with the grain (along the hair grown direction) as I find going across or against causes too much irritation.

The fewer passes I do, the better. One is ideal for my skin, although that's not necessarily ideal for removing hair properly. I try to minimize how many passes I do and I judge it by how irritated my skin is feeling.

###Post-shave

* Exfoliating

It does little beforehand and afterwards causes increased inflammation which worsens everything. I do not use it in my aftercare routine because my skin is just too sensitive and it makes everything that much worse.

* Witch hazel

Has had minor/no positive effect, post-shave. Apparently distilled witch hazel is has none of the astringent properties that the extract has. It's likely only as useful as an alcohol-based after shave product. I no longer use this.

* Deodorant

I see this recommended often. My skin is too sensitive to handle fragrances after shaving. I've never tried it because my skin *barely* handles deodorant under my armpits so I don't trust that it would be any better on inflamed skin. The key ingredient in deodorant that makes it work for shaving happens to be alum, which you can get your hands on in a pure form easily, and it happens to be known as...

* Alum (bar or powder)

I used to apply an alum bar (it also comes by the name of crystal deodorant) on damp skin after shaving. This absolutely works wonders to reduce irritation and bleeding from any nicks. These days I get alum powder from my Indian grocer (known as *fatakdi*) and I have a small bottle filled with a strong solution of dissolved powder in water which I apply because rubbing an alum block was causing irritation due to the mechanics of it. The solution seems to get more alum on my skin quicker and easier than using a block does too. I *always* end my shaving routine with alum solution, and if I don't I will end up with folliculitis and general irritation, even just from trimming.

* Moisturizer

It works. Use your preference, try for fragrance free if you are very sensitive. Apply after alum. It seems to help.

* Loose clothes afterwards

Definitely helps.

##How I have suddenly managed to start ""shaving"" again

This is the juicy part. I recently decided to try a double edge razor (I've dabbled before.) I recently took the plunge and purchased an adjustable razor which has a function that allows you to control how ""aggressive"" (read: close) the shave is. I picked up a Chinese knock-off of a reputable brand which has settings from 1-6 for about $10, with the legit model selling for around $100(!)

I set it up as I do and put it on its least aggressive setting and went to work with the included razor blade. I typically get a feeling of irritation and swelling as I'm shaving which is a sign of razor burn and ingrowns and folliculitis on their way. I was surprised to find that I didn't get this with. 

I went along the grain as per usual and did my usual aftercare routine. I found that it went very well for my skin and I noticed that my ""shave"" wasn't really exactly what I'd call a shave but more like a very close trim with about a mm of hair left above the surface of the skin. This is why my skin wasn't getting irritated. I found I didn't need to be extra-cautious as I usually am with overlapping or repeated passes, which was an immense relief for me.

I found that the included blades are actually pretty bad, not awful but not good enough to want to use them. I'm going to throw them away or use them for projects because they are crap (replacement blades are extremely cheap anyway.) I think that with decent quality razor blades which I prefer, the shaving will go even better and I'm planning to try out going against the grain next time too.

I might even explore going for a more ""aggressive"" setting to see how that works for me. As it stood I had to choose between horribly inflamed, irritated skin or grappling with crappy electric trimmers which never worked very well for me and which took much longer than they should. But now with this new approach I have a very simple, quick way of getting a close trim without upsetting my skin and it's already a game-changer for me.

****

&nbsp;

I hope that this effortpost is helpful to those people out there who really struggle with shaving like I do. If you're at your wit's end and you are looking for something which is quick, cheap, and easy then I'd recommend giving an adjustable double edge shaver a try. If it worked for me with skin as sensitive as mine then there's a good chance that it will work for you too. It might not be a smooth-as-silk outcome but I think it's going to be the best compromise I'll ever get with my skin.

I'm happy to answer questions about all of this if anyone is interested!

****

**Edit:** I swapped out the razor blade for a preferred type and, maybe a little foolishly, adjusted the shaver from 6 to 5 (making it a closer shave) while following my typical routine. My expectations were set from the first shot and I accidentally nicked my skin a couple of times because I was being careless. I also experienced some mild razor burn after the fact, though it settled quickly enough (~24 hours and things were near enough to being back to normal.) This time around it was much less forgiving than the first time.

I think that the least aggressive setting is the one for me, though I might try adjusting it by about 0.5 above the least aggressive setting in future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/azfoxo/my_modest_shaving_success_story/,My (modest) shaving success story,,112,4,0.99,Randolf_Schnitzler

IUDs can be a fabulous solution to all of your birth control needs (though, like any medical procedure or medication, they don't work for everyone). They can be quick and painless to be placed and give you up to 10 years of protection depending on which device you choose.

If/when you get your first IUD or when you get an IUD removed or replaced, talk to your provider when you book your appointment (many times, speaking directly with the provider is necessary) about how you expect to be treated (like a human who can feel pain) and confirm that they will have lidocaine gel available to apply to your cervix at the very beginning of the appointment followed by a paracervical block injection before insertion or removal/replacement is attempted. I recommend calling the day before your appointment to confirm these details and also considering confirming this plan before putting your feet in the stirrups to ensure everyone is on the same page.

td2ngi,Healthyhooha,1647160831.0,"I had my second bartholin cyst last week. The last time I had it, it only lasted 2 1/2 days and then popped. This time it grew faster and the pain was worse, don‚Äôt know why. I had it for three days and after doing some online research I found tons of home remedies and tips for pain management. I read about women who had these cyst from 2 weeks to years‚Ä¶YEARS! Now I will admit I have an incredibly low tolerance for pain, I‚Äôm as modern as they come when it comes to medicine and even more liberal when it comes to medications but the thought of spreading my legs for some random ER doc freaked me out more. We‚Äôll blame it on being a teen girl with self esteem issues. 

I gave those remedies a try for two days before I had my sibling drive me to the ER in tears at 2am (mind you at this point I couldn‚Äôt sit, walk, or sleep). The doctor immediately knew what it was and had everything laid out before I even got undressed. She gave me a local anesthetic directly into the cyst‚Ä¶you can imagine how that went. After that she made a small cut with a scalpel and drained it and I felt like I was in heaven. After that she did something called ‚Äúpacking‚Äù, which is where they put a small piece of gauze into the cavity to help it drain and make sure it doesn‚Äôt heal over too quickly. 

Now for the next part, I don‚Äôt know wether to give credit to the actions of this Doctor because she was a woman or because she was a WOC but she believed my pain. Something I‚Äôve never experienced. And allowed me to get a three day prescription for pain meds and a note to excuse me from work/school for two days. 

After two days I went to my GP and I got the gauze removed, it was basically painless and I‚Äôve been healing nicely ever since. 

Now I know going to the hospital isn‚Äôt accessible for all people for many reasons but for those who are able please do, especially if the pain is so bad you can‚Äôt move or do daily activities.

q4bu29,Healthyhooha,1633744253.0,"Hi there,

I‚Äôve been wanting to post about my YI healing journey for a long time now, but wanted to make sure I have absolutely no YI symptoms anymore before posting.

**Backstory**

I strongly believe my YI stemmed from my boyfriend (partner) and I using saliva as lube for sex, we‚Äôve used it before, but in limited amounts, but towards Oct/Nov 2020, it became our main lube substitute (ladies, **please don‚Äôt use saliva for sex**). Come mid-Nov 2020, I get my first ever YI.

I use the OTC YI medication, Monistat (7 day cream version), and feel like it‚Äôs quite a bit better, so my partner and I return to our normal endeavours a few days after (unprotected, which is usually not how it goes, we usually always use condoms). A few days after, my YI comes back full swing, so I use PH boric acid suppositories and use for 5 days. I believe it started getting better, but wanted to go to Dr to make sure - tested negative for yeast. However a few days after, it came back again.

I go on a **strict candida diet** (no sugar, no carbs) because I‚Äôm set to tackle this.

This time I used Monistat again, and though it worked, my YI came back after unprotected sex again. Dr prescribes me Terconazole, which is a strong cream anti-fungal, as well as using boric acid suppositories for 18 days, and it worked, until unprotected sex happened and my YI came back (you‚Äôre likely sensing a pattern, I didn‚Äôt fully comprehend until this time).

At this point, my vag is **extremely irritated, dry and I felt like there was no hope.**

At wit‚Äôs end, I use Terconazole again but this time for 13 days rather than the usual 7, used one suppository of vaginal probiotics (which dried my vag but maybe helped?), abstained from sex and OH MY GOSH my YI didn‚Äôt come back.

**The Healing Journey Begins**

Due to the amount of chemicals I put my vag through, it was quite irritated. I recall there were days I had trouble sleeping because my internal vagina (near cervix) felt super dry. I‚Äôd still get slight ‚Äúpings‚Äù of itchiness, but the infection didnt come back (still gone to this date!).

I stuck with the candida diet, until March where I verrrryyy slowly re-introduced sugary and carb foods (still minimal compared to how much I‚Äôd eat before). Extremely slowly re-introduced intercourse around July (4 months after my last infection, it was that irritated).

**Discovered Other Problems**

Though my YI was gone, I noticed I kept getting urinary frequency (tested for UTI but was negative), paper-tissue-like watery discharge, and my vagina was still sensitive and irritated. I posted on this sub-Reddit and people kept mentioning to get tested for Ureaplasma.

I tested positive for **Ureaplasma**.

Why was this discovery important? Ureaplasma is often an underlying cause for recurrent common infections for women, including UTI, BV, YI and Trich. I recall three years ago I kept getting UTI-like symptoms but no positive test results, it eventually went away until recently.**I suddenly understood why I likely kept getting the UTI symptoms and recurrent YI!**

**Where am I now?**

I have ordered both my partner and I the MicroGenDx complete for women and men, the urinary frequency comes and goes so we‚Äôve been procratinating on sending our tests in (we‚Äôre in Canada), would have to ship to Texas.

Thankfully no YI recurring and sex life is back to normal with no vaginal irritating - also attributed to protected sex with pH balanced vagisil wash beforehand and pH balanced lube.

**TLDR**;

Got recurrent YI likely from saliva used as lube for sex (don‚Äôt ever do that). Successfully treated with 13 days Doctor prescribed Terconazole, candida diet and abstaining from sex. Vag was super irritated the next few months. Discovered UTI like symptoms (not UTI) and YI recurrence likely stemmed from Ureaplasma which I tested positive for. Currently going to get tested with BF with MicroGen DX complete test kit (urine and vaginal / semen). YI free to this date!

Truly hope this helps, please message me or comment (preferred) if you have more Qs. I wasn‚Äôt able to find a full YI healing journey anywhere - everything was essentially ‚Äúused boric acid, and it worked‚Äù when boric acid didn‚Äôt work for me. EITHER WAY, THERE‚ÄôS STILL HOPE.

**Edit**: it was Terconazole cream my Dr prescribed, got it confused with Fluconazole, which is usually a anti-fungal pill.

At the time, I didn‚Äôt know my blood glucose was creeping toward 400, so while I had an abundance of testosterone because of this, my estrogen was way too low in relation. So, while I still had the urge to screw like a minx, I had no moisture.
Skip forward several months - my blood glucose is under tight control (runs around 90-110) and my hormone levels are back in regular balance throughout the month. Now my cycle is regular, too, and my horniness/wetness issues have resolved. If anyone else is going through something like this I urge you to get your hormone levels checked. No one suspected I was diabetic because I was 95 pounds when I was diagnosed, and my unchecked blood glucose wreaked havoc on my body before it was discovered. Several months after my T2 diagnosis I‚Äôm still getting back to ‚Äònormal‚Äô.
Stay healthy ladies‚úåüèª

Edit: I just wanted to add - fifteen years ago I accepted that my hormonal imbalance was ‚Äònormal‚Äô as my gyn told me. My estrogen levels were sky high and my testosterone was on the very high end of normal.
The thing is - hormonal imbalances are never normal. There is almost always an underlying condition, and it isn‚Äôt always diabetes. I encourage every woman to get their hormone levels checked regularly and if they are out of whack - pursue it! Find out why they are out of whack. Because the issue hardly ever resolves itself, and there is usually a lot of silent damage being done that will eventually manifest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/of6wq2/follow_up_about_sudden_vaginal_dryness/,Follow up about sudden vaginal dryness,,111,8,0.98,None

I think this study on [vaginal flexibility](https://www.longdom.org/open-access/measurement-of-vaginal-flexibility-and-its-involvement-in-the-sexual-health-of-women-2167-0420-1000302.pdf) is so interesting and wanted to share!

Basically they were bringing up that although the vagina is super stretchy, it obviously still has limits. Out of 120 women, the limit where penetration became uncomfortable was between 3.9 to 6.3"" (+0.2 to 2.2"" more than resting length). Based on that they said a lot of women have issues with partner incompatibility. They didn't really talk about how arousal would factor in to that though.

The only study I could find measuring changes with arousal is from the 60s. They found on average out of 100 women arousal causes the vagina to lengthen around \~1-1.6"" (without any penetration).

To stick those two studies together, comfortable penetration for the average person with a vagina could be roughly between 5 to 8"". Wish there were actual studies on this though, I can't find any.

I don't think it matters for most people, and even if it does it's easily managed by either getting more turned on, limiting depth or improving flexibility. But just thought it was super interesting, and something that hardly gets talked about.

What do people think? Anyone read any other sciencey sources for this?

I'm a rape survivor and thankfully have processed most of that and am doing much better now, but still regularly get accosted by men in ways that make me feel really unsafe.

I recently had a very scary and upsetting experience where this really gross and creepy guy essentially lured/tricked me into meeting him in public, then made it so that it was really difficult/awkward for me to leave. It took me 4 hours of sitting there staring at his ugly face while he tried and failed to """"flirt"""" with me, said awful uneducated things about marginalized groups, and referred to me sitting there awkwardly and uncomfortable as him being on a ""date"" with me, which actually still makes me want to vomit just thinking about it because it was just so delusional, I would literally never go on a date with someone so disgusting like that. I finally said I had to go when I felt like I'd been sitting there long enough and when I looked at my phone and saw that I'd been sitting there for 4 whole hours just putting up with this nightmare, I felt actually horrified. And I hate that I feel like this happened because for a split second, I wasn't actively being on the lookout for danger.

And even though this is one of the ""more awful"" experiences I've had lately, it's far from an isolated experience. In the past couple years alone, I've had a guy who worked at a store that I went into physically corner me to ask me out on a date, I've had guys loudly scream at me/catcall me from passing cars while I walked alone, I've had guys try to stalk me, and so many other experiences. Sometimes they're vulgar and loud, but more often than not they do it all """"politely"""" because of course they don't want to feel like a creep even when they are one.

And when this happens, some part of me always blames myself. Because I feel like it's on me to prevent these things from happening because no one else will. No one gives a fuck about protecting women from being harassed. No one stops it. So I have to be the one to stop it. And I'm just so fucking exhausted. Like I decided after this most recent experience with that creep that I'm going to work harder on not feeling like I have to be ""polite"" all the time, even when someone is ""politely"" making me uncomfortable, and to be able to just put myself first and extract myself from these situations, even if it feels uncomfortable/awkward in the moment.

See, on Monday I will have no more maxi pads and will have to just rely on normal pads, which worries me as I can barely get through a hour right now on normal pads.

My school is a very period unfriendly place, they do offer pads, but it‚Äôs flimsy low-flo pads that aren‚Äôt really of use to anyone.

Then all the boys thought it would be hilarious to ask to go to the toilet, so that the teacher would get frustrated and but a ban on people going to the bathroom. That way she couldn‚Äôt go. She did eventually manage by telling the teacher of the situation. Still, pretty humiliating for her.

My tale of woe starts like this: A couple weeks ago I had sex and I guess the condom my partner used was pre-lubricated, unbeknownst to me. I had started my period around that time, so I didn‚Äôt notice until a few days later an unpleasant fishy odor down there‚Ä¶ I hoped it was maybe just a weird period smell and took a treatment for a yeast infection, figuring that would cure it. BOY, it did not. I had sex again a few days after my period ended and lemme tell ya, I did not realize things were as bad as they were until then. That intro line from the song ‚ÄúColt 45‚Äù about the fish market? Yeahhhh‚Ä¶ thankfully my partner has anosmia (can‚Äôt smell super well) from long Covid, but I was humiliated enough to go to an urgent care. I tested positive for BV, and started Flagyl. The next day, I started getting telltale symptoms of a UTI and I headed back to urgent care to treat that. I finished out both courses and although the UTI got taken care of, I still had the odor and weird discharge, so I tried another antibiotic. Still had odor, still had weird discharge. I‚Äôd been having issues for almost two and 1/2 weeks at this point so I found this sub for advice. One post was someone asking about a retained tampon, which picqued my interest because that was something I was worried about too- when I had sex, I didn‚Äôt remember taking out my tampon before, but I wasn‚Äôt entirely sober and after reading most of the responses and performing a self-sweep I figured there was no way I had retained a tampon. Many of the comments on that post said that OP would know if there was a tampon up there. Well, I‚Äôm on week three of BV that just won‚Äôt go away and started my period again. I went to the bathroom bc shark week always brings gastrointestinal problems for me. I was doing my thing when I suddenly felt something slide out of me, and lo and behold, the world‚Äôs most decayed tampon was sitting there. IDK HOW I missed it while I was trying to find it but to everyone who said you can‚Äôt lose a tampon- you ABSOLUTELY can. I tried ‚Äúbearing down‚Äù multiple times, did a very thorough sweeping of my vagina, and even had sex MULTIPLE TIMES without realizing that I had a retained tampon.

Thought it was a yeast infection because I was the tiniest bit itchy, had brownish/pinkish discharge and it smelled BAD. I used a yeast infection treatment from the pharmacy yesterday. I called the nurse‚Äôs hotline and she recommended I go to urgent care. Any suggestions?

UPDATE FOR ANYONE INTERESTED:
I went to urgent care and had a pelvic exam done.

She pressed down on my stomach and I didn‚Äôt exactly feel pain but it felt unnecessarily tender so that‚Äôs another reason why she sent me to ER.

I spent 3 hours in the ER. I had an ultrasound (outside and intravenously) and then I also had to use a speculum to get a culture swab. Last, they decided to put a super painful shot in my butt cheek and give me a prescription for antibiotics because the doctor feared not noticing something and me one day realizing I can‚Äôt have kids because she missed something.

When I was 17 (and very anorexic) I developed strong pain in the area right under my rib cage, in solar plexus. It feels like an infected wound, in the sense that it hurts and I get dizzy and nauseous if I touch it, but if left alone it's managable. Sometimes it's almost not noticable, sometimes it's so painful that I have to pay attention to breathing carefully cause a deep breath will hurt. (That's how it is right now.)

I was first told it was the anorexia, but I sorted that out, I'm healthy now, BMI 18 and eating alright, but it's still there. I was told acid-reflux but I'm on meds for that and it doesn't help. (The dose I take is twice what someone my size would need too.) I was checked for ulcers and when it wasn't that they said it's psychosomatic (I have PTSD) but I KNOW that's wrong, I know what psochosomatic pain feels like for me and this is not it. Also it doesn't correlate with my mental state at all. I was also told to work on my self esteem cause that's supposed to be good for the chakra that's there or whatever. 

It tends to become worse from coke, tea, and other acidic things, but it can also show up if I completely avoid those, sometimes eating makes it worse, sometimes it makes it better. Being cold always makes it worse. Obviously, this shit makes it hard to concentrate, exercise, enjoy sex, and enjoy food since I always worry it's something I eat.

xwlsvr,WomensHealth,1665002687.0,"Going to try to be brief. We recently moved and my daughter saw a new doctor today for her annual well visit.

My daughter got her period when she was 11 and has suffered from extremely heavy, 10+ day periods. Last year, after she had established her cycle for 3 years, her previous doctor agreed to put her on birth control.

I thought of this as a win-win. It will help her periods out, and when she does need it for contraception, she‚Äôll already be on it, and hopefully won‚Äôt get pregnant at 16 like I did.

The doctor today asked if she ever tried coming off her birth control. Then proceeded to tell us there are negative long term effects. And that she should try coming off of it, and then get back on only when she plans to use it for contraception.

Here‚Äôs my thing though. What teenage girl, in the heat of the moment, is going to be like wait I need to be on my birth control for 3 months before we can start having sex?

Another comment that put me off was the fact that she said she has stayed the same height for a few years but is gaining weight, and asked if anyone in our family had thyroid problems.

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶My daughter is 5‚Äô1 and 129 pounds.

Saturday night I started having pain in my lower abdomen and back. I was at the tail end of my period, when I never ever get cramps. But I thought, okay, here‚Äôs some weird period cramps. It continued to get worse and worse though. By 4am I was writhing in pain and could barely walk. My boyfriend woke up and we decided to head to the ER an hour away. Well he drive 80 the whole way so it didn‚Äôt take quite that long. 

My stomach was bloated and hard. I was in constant pain with waves of even worse pain. It felt like intense pressure spreading through my belly. I was sure my appendix was about to burst. 

All of this started out of nowhere, no issues urinating or anything. Well after some testing they said it was a bladder infection and got me some meds and hydration. The pain started to fade a little. But I‚Äôd have taken double the pain if I could have avoided what came next. 

I got extremely disoriented and confused. I couldn‚Äôt think clearly or form a coherent sentence. My vision was getting blurry. And I became extremely anxious, paranoid and the deepest fear I‚Äôve ever experienced. I didn‚Äôt know who I was or where I was. I felt like I was going to die in that hospital bed. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that feeling on my worst enemy. 

The nurse said often they get old ladies with bladder infections and their only symptoms are confusion and delirium. So I guess that‚Äôs part of it. My amazing boyfriend did everything he could think of to keep me centered and grounded on him. If he hadn‚Äôt been so wonderful I don‚Äôt know what would have happened. I‚Äôm serious, I was losing my goddamn mind. I could have been so close to tearing out my IV and just running out into traffic or worse. It was so freaking scary. 

We got out of the ER around 8am Sunday morning, went home and slept until 4pm. More pain that evening and this morning. But I‚Äôm taking my meds and starting to feel like myself again.

izv2fq,WomensHealth,1601078271.0,"So I tried period underwear for the first time this month and it has been REVOLUTIONARY.

I have quite heavy periods, especially the first few days, and the worst part is bleeding through an overnight pad - normally I wear an overnight pad/maternity pad, plus a liner for extra ""length"" coverage, two pairs of underwear, and pajama pants,  but I would still regularly wake up with blood on my sheets and have to wash them. The past few years I have been sleeping on my side to try to fight gravity, which tends to save the sheets (if nothing else), but I don't sleep well like this because I keep waking up out of anxiety to check I haven't rolled onto my front or back.

However, a few weeks ago I bought 2 pairs of period undies because I was already replacing some of my ""designated period week"" undies and thought why not. I figured even if they didn't work on their own they could at least be good backup for a pad. 

Decided ""to hell with it"" and wore them overnight during my heaviest flow, fully expecting to wake up to a recreation of the elevator scene from The Shining. But instead: nothing! Not even the tiniest bit of leakage on my pajamas or my thighs. The rest of the week I had the best nights of period-week sleep I've had in at least a decade - plus I don't have to feel like I'm wearing a giant nappy (diaper) right before I go to bed.

I genuinely didn't think these would make such a difference. Tampons/menstrual cups don't really work for me so I had resigned myself to a lifetime of using mostly pads. However I've already decided to order more - next step is testing them out on daytime flow!

t58fhi,Healthyhooha,1646250368.0,"A few years ago I changed how I talk to health care providers in the assessment process, and I feel empowered from it. I'm a nursing student, and an important aspect of our job as nurses is to ultimately advocate for the patient, standing as a middle-man(or woman) that should help their patient understand what their doctor is saying, and make sure that the plan of care is according to the patient's wishes and personal goals. I want to practice that by sharing some advice and hopefully even getting some of your thoughts and opinions on what worked and did not work for you in an appointment with your doctor.

This is long, so glean from it what you will.

I'm Canadian and although we have ""free healthcare"" we have a severe lack of providers, so when you get a doctor, you tend to do what it takes to make it work. In an ideal world, I'd say that every patient should be matched with the personality type and specialties of each doctor, but I was on a list for 3 years to get a GP so that AIN'T happenin'. I think I can help you to get the most out of the doctor that you end up with while you consider the possibility of finding another practitioner if needed. 

I'm 30 and I'm only seeing my first OBGYN this year, but I've been through a lot of public, or school funded health clinics that come with the testing, prodding, prying, graphic conversations about discharge, and then there are the dreaded mystery problems that rear their lovely heads every once in a while. Like I said, learning how to talk to and work with your doctor in order to advocate for your own health is a lifelong skill that will offer you so much empowerment and relief for the rest of your mortal body-having life.

I'm currently dealing with a chronic (reoccurring) Yeast Infection that interferes with my quality of life. It's frustrating not having immediate answers, or finishing a course of treatment with no discernable results, but I feel like I have good open communication with my doctors and I do feel in control of how I am treated and the course of treatment that was made for me.

So here are some tips that have been working for me:

**Write it out**

I hate leaving a doctor's appointment and suddenly remembering something I forgot to tell them, or feeling so rushed at the appointment that I feel like I'm just going through the motions. Lately, I have been writing out what I want to say and reading it at the appointment. It prevents some rambling while I'm trying to find out how to best describe something. Keeps me on track too, when my doctor was recording what I was saying he would interrupt me for follow-up questions. From my write-up, I was able to backtrack and make sure the questions I had got answered. 

 I start the letter off by explaining that writing things down helps me express everything I wanted to in a succinct manner (ie, ""shut up and listen because this helps both of us""). My write-up was written in my own words and included the concerns I wanted to bring up at the appointment, my subjective and objective findings, what methods I had tried in the past, a recent history of my problem, and anything else I felt important to include.

**Develop ways of phrasing questions and concerns to doctors**

* ""My concerns are...""
* ""I saw/I have read about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Does this issue concern you? Is this a common occurrence in your practice? What instances have you seen this in your practice, and what were the outcomes?""
* ""Last time we tried \_\_\_\_, but I did not see the result that I expected. How can we change the course of treatment so that I can reach my goal of \_\_\_\_\_""
* ""I'd like to try \_\_\_\_\_\_ as an alternative therapy. What do you know about \_\_\_\_, and do you have any concerns with this therapy interacting with our treatment plan laid out today"" (note that you're not asking permission, or whether or not they would recommend it. My doctor, for example, won't suggest probiotics or naturopaths, but there is merit in tapping into alternative therapies. A doctor of medicine is just that - they practice in medicine. If it's not a medicine or clinically-proven answer, they probably won't prescribe it to you, but they can give you their advice so you can make an informed decision)

**Develop a relationship with your pharmacist**

Doctors are great, but a good pharmacist is a hidden gold mine of questions about your prescriptions and body that you should be tapping into if you haven't already. Pharmacists can also prevent polypharmacy, basically drug-drug interactions. 

My pharmacist is Lisa, she's a doll, and so are the other pharmacists that work at her pharmacy. She has advised me not to opt for certain generic drugs because she knows the brand name is better (and vice versa for other drugs). She rolled her eyes at my doctor saying no to consulting with a naturopath and gave me a card of the one she uses. Her colleague answered every question I had about the possibility of a side effect of a drug contributing to my YI, he did so gracefully and I was peppering him like mad with questions, even though I don't think he even has a vagina of his own! He then shared his professional opinion on probiotics when my doctor just stated ""there's no evidence that they have any effect"". I can't stress enough how important it is to find a pharmacist you like, especially one whose eyes light up when you ask questions about drugs and microbes and sciency stuff. 

**Make a Pain Diary**

You may have heard that pain is the sixth vital sign, or that it is totally subjective. It is, and the provider who is trying to assess your pain is going to ask you more about it. Before your appointment, if you are battling with pain, think about these qualitative questions that a provider would ask about your pain so you can be ready.

* Where is the pain? You mentioned it's coming from the inside but is it felt along the walls of the vagina from the friction of the insertion? Is it deep inside like a period cramp? Is it coming from the urethra/urinary meatus? Is it radiating from one place in the body to another place?
* Can you describe the pain? Burning, sharp, stabbing, dull ache, etc?
* On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate the severity of pain? 1 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you have ever felt in your life. 
* What time, and under what circumstance does the pain occur? If the pain varies throughout the day, can you make a ""pain diary"" of times and circumstances when the pain varies? For example, ""When I first wake up I feel it at a level 5. When I am at work on my feet all day the pain is mild, about a 3. Every time I urinate the burning sensation spikes to a 7 for about an hour."" Think of all factors that bring on the pain.
* What, if anything, has worked in the past to alleviate some or all of the pain? Which drugs or other therapies (heating pads, walking, etc)

**Last point for now,** 

Ideally, you will be comfortable and feel safe enough to share any aspect of your health and clinical record that is needed for your provider to get a clear and accurate picture of your current health. They will use this information for the sole purpose of giving you the best plan of care possible. 

You and I both know that doesn't always happen. I'd like to bring you in on this problem that providers are becoming more aware of.

First, if a big reason why you feel like you can't trust your provider is due to the fact that that you identify with a minority group based on your cultural identity, [sexuality](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5478215/), or various other groups disparaged for being a minority, you have every reason to be skeptical and **I hear you, and I am working to advocate for change, and advocate for your health**. Patients have lost their quality of life or even died as a result of gross negligence from their provider. Minority groups are particularly vulnerable to experiencing adverse effects in the healthcare system. Systemic [racism](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/toronto-area-rapper-blames-systemic-racism-for-months-of-misdiagnosis-1.4716013) exists within healthcare, too. Patients have been stereotyped, and this information has been used to [ignore](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/winnipeg-brian-sinclair-report-1.4295996) or [ridicule](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-atikamekw-joliette-1.5743449) them while they are practically on their deathbed. There is a deep, dark history that reinforces this, and it's not going to just go away because us white folks forgot about them.

My only advice comes from a webinar I studied that put healthcare providers together to learn tips to avoid these adverse reactions in their clinical practice. [**Indigenous Perspectives on Patient Safety- Pre-recorded Webinar**](https://www.patientsafetyinstitute.ca/en/toolsResources/Pages/Indigenous-Perspectives-on-Patient-Safety-2019-10-03.aspx) **if you want to take a look.** I took a lot away from this webinar, and a few points I have are: 

* Miscommunications happen intentionally and unintentionally, and when they result in a lack of complete care they are considered adverse reactions
* These adverse reactions I'm talking about aren't always reported by patients, they simply walk away with less trust in the healthcare system, confused and still unwell
* Some patients think it's rude to correct or question their provider, or they may fear for their own privacy 
* Some history is traumatic to bring up, and if not supported, a patient may never see the benefit in sharing this information with a provider which is, for them, re-living the trauma
* If patients don't feel like they are being treated well they won't share important information
* To engage in patient safety providers have to address their fear
* You should never feel interrogated. Your subjective experience is YOURS, and should not be questioned. 
* Indigenous (minority) issues with the healthcare system are a magnification of all existing issues

*Do I really want to tell my GP, who recently immigrated from Pakistan, that I elected to have an abortion? No. But that is a major factor in why I am now so reluctant to go for pelvic exams, even pap smears. When the doctor asked me if I had any prior surgeries of course the abortion came to mind. It was the single most terrifying day of my life.*

 That's an example of an unintentional adverse event that stems from miscommunication.  What this doc didn't reinforce was that there would be no consequence or judgment, so the patient avoided telling him something important. Now this patient is at a higher risk of cervical cancer and fear of judgment/anxiety that potentially affects their mental health. Is this all because of one question? Or was it the lack of trust established between care provider and patient that should have begun at the beginning of the assessment and carried through?

I cannot resolve past trauma for you. I cannot necessarily hold your hand to help you navigate a systemically racist world that results in our safety and holistic health being challenged. I can't just tell you not to worry about what that ER nurse giving you the sideways glance thinks about you when you tell them your pain is a 7/10. 

I do want to let you in on this problem so you can make an informed decision about advocating for your own health. I wish I could encourage you to share everything you can for the sake of your own health, but I acknowledge the complexities of doing so, I realize it's easier said than done. As a future healthcare provider, I am doing all I can to inform myself to prevent that from happening, and that's all I can say from my limited perspective in good faith!

I struggled with BV for quite a while, but a round of antibiotics cleared it up within a week. I was prescribed Flagyl twice a day for seven days. It did clear my BV up, but as I feared, I got a yeast infection.

I took Canesten (Canadian Monistat) for the 3-day suppository with the cream, and it somewhat helped, but it didn‚Äôt completely go away. About a month ago I started to eat very clean, with the intention of losing weight rather than thinking it would clear my infection. But eating healthy, like plain yogurt, lean protein, lots of vegetables and fruit, and especially lots of water...my yeast infection went away on its own. 

I recently got back into taking antibiotics (I take 10 billion) and it has helped even more! Not to say this will work for everyone, but I honestly suggest trying to eat as healthy as possible and it may work for you.

fo82mj,Healthyhooha,1585067493.0,"Sorry this is horribly long and probably formatted strangely (I‚Äôm on mobile)

I‚Äôm 24, I‚Äôve been menstruating since I was 15. I began taking oral birth control (sprintec 28 day) to manage my periods. Typically I would have them for 2-3 weeks, with maybe a week in between without bleeding. It was awful. Sprintec worked for me, although I would still have my period for a full week. I tried nexplanon for a year and a half, didn‚Äôt manage my ‚Äúnatural‚Äù cycle at all so I went back to Sprintec a few years ago. I‚Äôve seen multiple doctors about this over the years and they just don‚Äôt care to explore what other options I might have or what the real cause of this is.

Over FIVE WEEKS AGO I started my period (way off schedule, I was still taking sprintec at the time) It hasn‚Äôt stopped. Although it‚Äôs been light now for over a week. I‚Äôve continuously taken sprintec because I just want it to stop and it won‚Äôt. I went to Planned Parenthood because holy crap, it‚Äôs never gone on for this long before!! They simply tested me for STIs and pregnancy and because I didn‚Äôt have any pain with my period or urinating they sent me on my way, didn‚Äôt even give me a referral. 

Now, a week later, I‚Äôm randomly feeling like I have a UTI (I‚Äôve had maybe 2 or three in my life prior to this) at least once during the day, for a couple hours at a time, and my urine smells really bizarre. I started breaking out which is highly unusual for me, I admittedly have had effortlessly perfect skin my whole life so I have to assume this is related- possibly hormonal?

I think honestly I‚Äôm just scared and frustrated and was too bewildered to demand better treatment, so I think I should go back especially now that I‚Äôm having these UTI symptoms.

I feel so broken and lost, my mental health is suffering big time and I‚Äôm depressed.

First off, I‚Äôm a virgin and I‚Äôm 21. I‚Äôve been battling BV for a little over a year, and last time I went to the doctors I tested negative. But I can‚Äôt even celebrate, I‚Äôm still having wack ass symptoms. For starters, the period I had before testing negative caused me so much itching I felt like exploding lol. And I‚Äôm still itchy on my inner lips, with my PH in the worst possible zone on test strips. Around August I also started having UTI symptoms but tested negative for UTIs, so that doctor basically told me ‚Äúwho cares you‚Äôre negative‚Äù and sent me on my way. But I was in PAIN. The UTI symptoms morphed into something else a month or so later, and I got a big red rash that itched and caused me pain around my clit area. That‚Äôs when I tried Vaseline and noticed an improvement. Long story short, I‚Äôm 99% certain I have female jock itch as creams for rashes/eczema did not help and even made it worse, but creams for jock itch do. I‚Äôm also negative for yeast infections and those pills do nothing. The UTI like symptoms were irritation from the rash thing going on. 

I‚Äôve begged to be looked at by my last doctor for the rash, and she didn‚Äôt even look just did a swab and kicked me out. She also said too bad if I still had BV ‚Äúü•∫ü•∫ try probiotics!‚Äù (I‚Äôve taken way too many variations at this point).

I am tired of taking, and keeping track of, all these different supplements to keep me healthy down there. So I put everything into one supplement. These gummies have pineapple, apple cider vinegar, cranberry, chlorophyll, d mannose, prebiotic, and probiotic. I made it into a gummy by adding sea moss gel and agar agar, and flavored it with stevia and extra pineapple extract. The supplements I put in the gummies are pretty condensed, but since the bears are so small I am probably going to take about 10-15 daily. With the hearts, I'm going to take about 5 - 10 daily. Do you guys think that‚Äôs a safe dosage? Does anyone have experience taking these kinds of supplements?

ldaxht,TwoXSupport,1612542762.0,"I have no one to talk to about this and I just want to hear from some other women who have gotten through this.

Posted this in r/twoxchromosomes but I think this might be a more appropriate place for it. Sorry if this is triggering, I'm not sure how to get my point across without being triggering. 

The first boyfriend I had after high school was a guy I lived with during a government program. I was 18 and he was 24. We weren't allowed to drink or do drugs while in the program but we would get a weekend of free leave every couple of months. Getting drunk as a group on our first leave was the first time that I had ever been drunk on purpose. It was clear that I could not hold my liquor, nor did I know when/how to stop. So on our next leave together, my boyfriend made sure that we got a separate hotel room and fed me drinks all day long.

I thought that we were having fun. It was a weekend and we had nowhere to be, so why not drink? I had my camera with me. He asked if he could film us having sex. I told him no. I told him that I was not comfortable with it. He said, Okay. I had had one boyfriend before this, one who had always respected my boundaries. I thought we were on the same page. I think I went to the bathroom and came back. We started having sex, and I noticed my camera was on a weird angle. I was pretty drunk already and tried to concentrate on the sex.

Afterwards he actually showed me the video he had taken. I reminded him that I wasn't okay with this, and that I had told him I wasn't okay with it. ""It's on *your* memory card"", I recall him saying condescendingly. He implied that I could just delete it and no one would see it. With that context, I thought, maybe I *would* keep it to watch a second time. I had never seen myself have sex, and if I could delete it whenever I wanted... 

He lied. It was his memory card. He had put it in my camera beforehand. 

He continued to feed me drinks. At one point I spilled a pitcher of beer and got some on my camera. I can remember the beer but not why my camera was nearby. A lot of the rest of that day/night is missing. >!I know that I started kissing my female friend and we had a threesome. I also know that he initiated unlubed anal sex with both of us once we were approaching/blackout drunk.!< I fear that he recorded more than I am aware of. 

We continued to date after that. I couldn't wrap my mind around the idea that he would do these things maliciously. I didn't realise how much he had broken down my sense of self-worth by that point. I felt ashamed that I had let him do exactly what my parents warned me about. I felt like I helped him take advantage of my friend. I still feel so guilty about this. 

He would go on to record us having drunk sex in the future and post it online. At one point after we broke up I asked him to take it down and preferably delete everything from his computer. He took the video down. I do not know if there are other videos or if that video is on other sites. Obviously his word means nothing. 

I don't know what to do with these feelings. Advice would be much appreciated.

jvinlr,WomensHealth,1605572262.0,"Hello all,

I was recently diagnosed with an ovarian cyst and a fibroid in the ER during the summer. At the ER, they said they were going to do a transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound on me, I refused the transvaginal because I have vaginismus and didn't think I could handle it.

Due to my symptoms continuing, I booked an appointment with a gyno for December. They said I should get a transvaginal to monitor the progress of the cyst and fibroid. Because my symptoms were evolving, I decided to take this seriously. I booked an appointment with an imaging clinic and bought some vaginal dilators to work on my vaginismus in the meantime (for me it's 100% psychological, not a physical abnormality with my vagina, and I've seen improvement so far!)

The time for my ultrasound comes. I'm nervous and tell the tech about my vaginismus, and to please go slow. She assures me she will, and then asks if I've had any pregnancies. I say no. Then she asks, ""but you've had intercourse, right?"" and I say ""no, never."" She frowns and says ""then I can't do the transvaginal on you, I'm sorry. It's a liability."" I explain that I've been using dilators just as big as the wand, and I've had other things inside of me, but I'm a lesbian so I've never had actual sex with a man. She repeats herself and just says, ""it's a liability for us"". So I put my pants back on and leave!

I called my gyno and everyone I talked to was surprised that they wouldn't do it. They were even ready to do it in the ER without asking about my sexual history at all. Is this something I can expect to be the norm? I'm just going to meet with my gyno next month and take it from there, but this really annoys me. I consented to the ultrasound and explained that I have had things in my vagina before, but because it wasn't a penis I'm denied a medically necessary procedure?

I'm wondering if anyone else has run into something similar. Thanks!

Theyre changing their diets, medication, soaps, feeling horrible. Yet somehow, the few ive talked to, dont seem to be considering its their partner.

If you have a partner plays a big role in your sexual health. Your partners tongue, really, could be all to blame. Please check if your bf/gf has a clean mouth, or even clean genitalia/hands! It is very easy to get these infections when the bacteria and yeast are essentially coming from them.

To check if someone has a clean mouth, see if their tongue is white. This is bacterial overload from food and drinks. Depending on what they eat before going down on you also has something to say. A poop-like odor coming from the mouth is also a sign of decay or tooth infection and can in rare cases give hefty UTIs.

Generally ask them to brush their teeth/tongue and wash their hands/genitalia before sex. And remember to always pee after.

cyl1em,Healthyhooha,1567403494.0," Repost of my post from r/twoxchromosomes

As the title states, recently I've been kinda more dehydrated after moving into my new apartment. My place doesn't have a filtration system, so my housemates and I use a Brita. However, I tend to not drink water when it is not cold, therefore, I have been more forgetful to drink water because of it. I can tell that I am dehydrated because I feel like I am suffering from a UTI, but the moment I drink a bit of water, the feeling goes away after a while.

   I had multiple bouts of UTIs in the past year, and I went to the doctors and took antibiotics for them. Whenever I have sex now, I do almost about everything needed to do to prevent a UTI from sex. Over the summer, I did not engage in any sexual activity, yet I had the UTI-feeling dehydration thing going on. I went to a doctor about it and got a urine test + culture done. According to the doctors, I was negative for a UTI, but they still prescribed antibiotics just in case.

   Somethings I also noticed was when I get dehydrated, my legs would feel like I'm wearing shorts in the winter even though it is like 90 degrees outside, and my feet feel like they are on fire. These feelings would go away if I either wore sweatpants/cover my legs with a blanket and soak my feet in cold water. 

   I swear this happens almost daily now and it is pretty irritating and distracting from my classes.

cj551w,Healthyhooha,1564367561.0,"Last November I had some of the most severe burning I've ever had in my life suddenly start overnight. I went to my gynecologist (at the time), who said it looked like yeast but I tested negative so she didn't treat me for anything. The pain got so severe that I ended up in an InstaCare where the doctor stated they were treating me for yeast because it was obviously when I had. Took the meds, still was on fire. Switched to a different gynecologist who tested me for BV which came back positive, took the 7 Days of pills and while things definitely died down a little bit I still had some burning and irritation. I went back for a 2nd appointment to the doctor that prescribed me the BV medication and she essentially said there was nothing else to treat me for - in fact her nurse said *""I dont even know why youre here. This could just be your new normal.""* (Hello, red flag.) The doc recommended I see someone who specializes in vaginal infections (all the while telling me all my tests were coming back clean). I felt embarrassed by the nurse and dismissed by the doctor so I looked for yet another new gyno.  
Thankfully, this third doctor has been really wonderful in her bedside manner. She has promised me that we are going to figure this out which gives me hope, however, it feels like we have run every single test that can be run. Chlamydia and gonorrhea, BV, yeast, a skin biopsy of my vulva sent to a dermotology lab, PAP, various cultures, mycoplasma and ureaplasma ... all negative. I am not on birth control.  
The last time I had an appointment was in March, at which point she prescribed me a steroid cream to use on my vulva during external flares - all it does is make me feel goopy on top of the burn. I use free and clear detergent, wear only cotton underwear, nothing scented, no dryer sheets, drink tons of water, shave/dont shave...you name it and I have tried it.  
Even though this burning isn't every single day I do have flare-ups probably once or twice a month that last few days - sometimes internal, sometimes external,  sometimes both. Between PMS, periods, and this irritation I feel like I never get any time to feel normal. It is affecting my sex life with my husband, my ability to feel safe to plan a vacation, exercise, or even run errands because I don't know what my body is going to do. It's now been 8 months and I am so worn out. I've requested another appointment with my doctor but I honestly don't know what's even left. I feel hopeless.

I'm so frustrated because I moved to Florida from a different  state and there  is a stark difference in the options for women in both states. 

Within a 100 mile radius not one place covers breast MRIs with my insurance. I'm supposed to get one  once a year due to the fact that I am high risk. The only freaking place in town that does it is the hospital which could cost upwards for a few thousand dollars with my insurance. No independent diagnostic imaging  centers in this area do breast  imaging,  but apparently  I can get my pancreas done by any of these. (I'm also supposed to get one of my pancreas for a baseline  because it is one of the hardest cancers to detect). 

I'm just  so incredibly  frustrated,  I'm watching  my mother go through  metastatic  breast cancer and I'm scared.

I was taking probiotics, NAC, using boric acid suppositories as well as probiotics vaginally. My partner was also on a probiotic regime. Every time I was on medication we would go back to using condoms for 4-6 weeks. The BV would disappear for a very small period of time then once we stopped using condoms, it was back within 2 weeks. 

By summer 2021, I asked my doctor (ND who leaned traditional) if there would be any harm in treating my partner with meds since nothing else was working. She agreed but cautioned me it likely wouldn‚Äôt make a difference since men ‚Äúcan‚Äôt carry BV‚Äù. When I met my partner he had been suffering from digestive and skin issues for a few months and that had continued during the BV issues. 

Within a month after he was treated with meds, his digestive issues disappeared, skin was improved and I was BV free!!! 

I normally trust doctors and science very much but it‚Äôs clear the science with men and BV is lagging.

iraa7c,WomensHealth,1599906752.0,"Hi everybody, I'm that girl who was worried that her ovary was already dead. Well, I am here with an update on how this whole thing went, and while it could have been much worse, it still isn't pretty. My apologies if this post is a bit...graphic.

So, after that appointment, several more followed, with each one being made quick. My labwork pointed towards something cancerous as apparently a CA125 of over 1000 and LDH of over 500 is quite alarming. So, I was referred to a cancer specialist and laparoscopic surgery was taken off the table.

Saw the specialist, and he referred me to a hospital a couple hours away for a closer look. It was the largest university hospital in the state. He at first figured it would be a horizontal bikini cut across my abdomen, but was worried for the size. He fast-tracked me, and I was set to get CT scans and labwork galore two days after that appointment, with my surgery planned a week later. Even with COVID, that had not changed.

I. Hate. Needles. But, it was more clear what was going on after the tests; not only had my cyst grown from 14 to 21 cm since my last post, but it had spread to other parts of my body. It had to come out.

So, this Tuesday I went in. It...it was rough, but the final damage was done and addressed; the spotting made it to my spleen and diaphragm, so they had to trim those up. I was lucky that they only had to take a third of my spleen and a chunk of my diaphragm; those will still be fully functional with time, somehow (though right now it hurts like hell to breathe). Of course, they had to take the ovary and fallopian tube with the big cyst, as that was basically ground zero of all of this. The cyst was even displacing a few loops of my GI tract.

However, I am alive. They left me with my uterus and other ovary; they just shelled that cyst away and decided that since I am most likely getting chemo anyway, the ovary can be left inside as these areas were somehow not as affected. They aren't even sure if the smaller cyst was cancerous due to the composition and stable size. My liver, while they had to move it a bit, is thankfully unharmed. They expect me to make a full recovery with no lifelong meds or dietary restrictions, which still sounds too good to be true.

I am now at a hotel, discharged after a few days. Let me tell you, while those nurses were amazing, there was no way that they could change the fact that those few days were hell. I was pumped full of gas like a balloon, and I had to wait for my bowels to wake back up to have any sort of relief from that regardless of the numerous things they gave me. Even now, I sit here awake at the dead of morning because I can't get my bowels to quiet down; they woke up angry. Thankfully, my bladder decided it was more than ready to cooperate with me now that the cyst no longer pushing against it, though it took me a while to be able to keep down water. The nurses were shocked that I was so willing to get up and move around; I have an incision going from just below my chest to my pubic region, so that is...well, not so fun. Thankfully they are using the ovary and cyst they removed as biopsy material, so I shouldn't have to go through that again. 

My head is still reeling about how this much damage could happen in a few months...I was more or less the picture of health before all of this. My advice to anybody reading this; if you have a weird pain in your abdomen or pelvis that just won't go away, get your ass to the doctor as soon as possible. Those areas are not something to take lightly, and if I had waited until October like that first place wanted me to do, I would likely be a dead girl.

EDIT: I have a question to ask for anybody reading this who has recovered from a long incision like mine, or knows somebody who has; any idea when I can safely and comfortably lie down on my sides again? Sleeping on my back has never been comfortable, but any supported side-lying position is a straight-up ""No."" from gravity.

il49zv,WomensHealth,1599042438.0,"...don't let it go unchecked.

I wanted to write this as a piece of advice and a reminder both to myself for the future and hopefully to some of you here in this sub.

Last week I was diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm 29, in otherwise great health and shape. I was very active, never smoked, was only drinking 2-3 glasses of wine or one beer per week, no hard liquor. Plant based, protein rich diet. I have also survived cancer, Wilms' tumor stage 4, with metastases in both lungs, at age 7. Back then, by the time my parents brought me to the hospital, doctors estimated that I had about 1 to 2 months to live, even with surgery and chemotherapy. I had been cancer free since then and when I found out that I had two small lumps in my left breast, I would never, ever imagine or believe that I would get a second cancer, but here I am now.

My lumps are about 1 cm each. My doctors say that clinically (by touch) they appear benign, but the biopsy confirmed that they are cancerous. Being the age I am, I didn't think it was cancer-how could it be? I had read on the internet, after all, page after page, that breast cancer is very rarely painful (my lumps are painful), it doesn't present as round shaped masses (mine are completely round, with smooth and clear borders), and I didn't have any other changes in my breast, no dents, no inverted nipple or discharge,  no redness. Apart from the lumps and the fact that they are -sometimes-painful, I have no other symptoms. But I do have cancer. And I need to have a mastectomy (because they are two, close to each other and my breast is really small) and possibly a double one too as they are testing me for cancer genes/mutations to see if there is a high chance that I will get breast or ovarian cancer in the future. I don't know what my treatment after surgery is exactly going to be, but I have already had radiotherapy and chemotherapy as a kid and I know that they are no fun, no fun at. ALL.

I know that many have written or talked about this kind of warning before, but please, to anyone that is now in the position I was a couple of months ago, don't Google anything, don't try to compare your symptoms to somebody else's, don't try to convince yourself that ""it's nothing"" because it cannot be, don't post question after question on the medical subs here on Reddit; even if the odds are in your favour, sadly, it happens, even if it's so rare and bodies are so different that you might have the same condition with somebody else but totally different symptoms. Don't think it over and over again, don't make the same mistakes I did! Everybody deserves to have some peace of mind and it's more than probable that you will end up with something benign or relatively harmless, of course; but! Don't postpone going to the doctor for any reason. Go as soon as you notice the slightest change. It's better to be ""paranoid"" than letting something go unnoticed.

I wish everyone the best of luck if you're under testing now, waiting for any kind of results, or considering going to the doctor for something; don't panic, but make the call if you can. It will be worth your time and money. Everything comes to an end eventually, so just hang in there!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/il49zv/when_somethings_wrong/,When something's wrong...,,106,11,0.97,None

2) I don‚Äôt know if this is just me, but whenever I‚Äôm sitting for a long time on my period I just have to check to see if I leaked. I usually pretend like I‚Äôm brushing dirt or whatever off the back of my pants, but in reality I‚Äôm checking to see if my pants are wet with blood.

d5g07r,Healthyhooha,1568721967.0,"*Disclaimer* This of course will vary woman to woman.
A woman‚Äôs cycle can last between 28-35 days on average. Somewhere in the middle of your cycle, about 2 weeks before your period starts, you‚Äôll be in a stage called the fertile window. This is an approximately 7 day window where you are most fertile, in other words, most likely to become pregnant if you are having unprotected sex.

When an egg is released, a dull pain may occur around either the left or right hip depending on what side the egg was released. This pain can radiate towards the lower back and last for anywhere between a few minutes or a couple hours. 

Although ovulation only lasts for about 10-48 hours, it is important to keep in mind that sperm can survive for around 5 days. This means it is especially important to be cautious of the days leading up to ovulation if your partner is using the ‚ÄúPull Out‚Äù method. 

You will also notice that your vaginal discharge has become clear and slippery in consistency, resembling that of an egg white in the days leading up and following ovulation. The pH has also become slightly more neutral to allow the sperm to make its way to the egg for fertilization, whereas this would‚Äôve been more difficult during any other time of your cycle due to a lower (more acidic) pH of your vaginal discharge. 

Ovulation tests can be found at drugstores and pharmacies, or it can be tracked with a period app. I recommend Clue or Eve. For any questions/concerns don‚Äôt be shy, send me a message!

There were many days I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed or couldn‚Äôt go to work. I would be hunched over walking to the bathroom, sitting in the bathtub with hot water to just try and alleviate some of the pain. I was constantly taking Advil and using heating pads. There were many visits to urgent care because of how much pain I was in. The best way I can describe it is it felt like someone was holding my uterus in their hands and wringing it out like a wet towel. The pain was absolutely debilitating and I cried many, many tears. This lasted for days up to an entire week every. month. It completely affected my quality of life and I had to plan everything in my life around my period. I wouldn‚Äôt make any plans the week before and during my period because I knew I would not be able to do anything because of the level of pain I‚Äôd be in. My entire life revolved around this.

-Breast soreness and unexplained dense breast tissue that required many ultrasounds

-Heavy amounts of discharge throughout the entire month. I was changing my underwear twice a day.

-Random stomach and abdominal pains throughout the month (this started near the end of the seventh year with the IUD. I suspect this is because it was deteriorating inside of me.)

-Awful mood swings. I had periods where I would just cry and feel like I was going insane. Periods of random crying, feeling clinically depressed, unable to leave bed. My moods were constantly up and down, unpredictable and difficult to manage. Throughout the seven years I was prescribed numerous antidepressants and anti-anxiety medication. Once I had the IUD removed, my mental health drastically improved.

-Chronic UTI‚Äôs

-Chronic BV (I was told that women with the ParaGard tend to get BV more often because the bacteria attaches onto on the strings of the IUD.)

-Ovarian cysts. I started getting them during year 6-7. I was having more pain than usual and had to get many ultrasounds to check and monitor the cysts to assess if they needed to be removed. Once I had the IUD taken out, the cysts disappeared.

-Fatigue and always feeling tired. I used to be so tired, and in so much pain that I could barely go outside and exercise.

-Bloating and stomach issues. Chronic diarrhea and I could not debloat for the life of me. It felt like I was always walking around six months pregnant.

1175zq1,Healthyhooha,1676897841.0,"I (27F) used to have a very resilient pH. I could use hotel soap, regular laundry detergent etc and never had a single issue other than the very very occasional yeast infection every few years. 

I got a copper IUD back in 2018 and by 2019, I was unfortunately onboard the recurring/chronic BV train. I was constantly embarrassed of my smell down there, and tired of itching. When I would go in for treatment, I would have a yeast infection until I treated that, and the BV would creep back in. It was upsetting and frustrating. I felt like I had tried everything. I never had more than a few weeks over the past three years where I wasn‚Äôt dealing with itching or smell. Even when it was better, I was constantly paranoid about it coming back. I was never able to find a rhyme or reason for it happening. I was careful about using in scented laundry detergent, taking probiotics, not using soap, etc. 

A few months ago I ended up getting sterilized via a bisalp and had my copper IUD removed. I had BV at the time which I got treated for. And I haven‚Äôt had a single. Issue. Since. 

Looking back on the timelines, I am almost positive the copper IUD was causing my issues. This is conjecture and of course an anecdote. It makes sense though because copper is an anti-microbial, and it was likely throwing off the balance for my personal biome by being slightly better at killing off the good bacteria than it was the bad. It also works by causing low grade inflammation in the uterus, which probably wasn‚Äôt helping the situation. 

Birth control is intensely personal and I would never want to be alarmist. I think the copper IUD works really really well for many people, and it‚Äôs so important to have non-hormonal long-acting birth control available. I personally struggled with other side effects from hormonal BC methods that made it worth it for me to have the copper IUD. But I hope this post can maybe help others perhaps connect the dots about any struggles they may be having. Ymmv always of course.

I don't put anything in my vagina other than tampons. I have a very pronounced and persistent scent. It seems to be more noticeable at various times. During any kind of sexual activity (this includes sex with a partner and just pleasuring myself with toys, masturbation, etc), the smell becomes much more noticeable. I make excuses to dissuade sexual partners from giving me oral sex, even when they are very keen to do it, because the smell makes me insecure. My go-to excuse is telling them I'm on my period when I'm actually not. I also smell stronger than usual during my period and for a few days after it. Any kind of exercise also makes the smell stronger. I can also smell myself whenever I change my underwear, which I do every day. It hits me as soon as I take off my knickers/panties. It doesn't matter what I'm doing, the smell is just constantly there. I also drink a lot of water and eat a lot of fruits and vegetables.

I recently washed with very diluted baby mild Dr. Bronner's and I was thrilled that the funky smell was gone. I did it a few more times and after a week I got the worst UTI of my life. 

How in the world can I navigate this? Water really isn't cutting it and it affects my sex life with my husband. It's just swampy it isn't an infection. On the other hand, I don't want to risk a UTI again. I used to get them badly as a child after baths as well. 

Any advice? Any other soap recommendations? Anything that gets the swamp smell without soap?

Edit: it smells the same way my buttcrack smells when I sweat too much. That smell comes sooner rather than later when I wash with just water instead of soap. It isn't because of lack of water or BV or a PH imbalance. I'm just a sweaty bitch. 

So far it looks like lactacyd and honey pot are the favorites? Along with dove sensitive? Sulfates tend to irritate me is one worry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/mjv0e0/soap_in_between_the_outer_lips/,Soap in between the outer lips?,Hygiene üßº,105,82,0.97,rooroosterchips

18vqlw8,Healthyhooha,1704089859.0,"NGL this will likely be the weirdest post you will ever read and that's the reason why I need to put this out here. So background information, I've always had an extremely neurotic disposition, extremely anxious personality, low-self esteem, over-worrier, and I have OCD.

My OCD is really at the root of this. I have had horribly intrusive obsessive thoughts since even before puberty hit and often times these thoughts were sexual in nature. My compulsion would be to stretch/tug on my labia (yeah, when I said this post would get weird, I meant it. I'm not even embarrassed about it anymore, I've given up on caring for the following reasons) and I've done it from a VERY young age. I'm 23 currently and I've noticed in my teenage years that the skin on my vulva has gotten looser/wrinkly as a cause of it. It's caused me despair and humiliation because of it; but try as I might I could not get myself to change my compulsion to something else that wouldn't involve me causing harm to my vagina.

My vulva has changed in ways that I have continued to languish over but up until now, I felt as though--hey, at least if I ever had sex (as I am still a virgin) these changes would only be noticed if someone took a real close look at it and knew to compare it to uh less um damaged vaginas.

However recently I have been suffering from pelvic floor muscle spasms for a couple of months now. At first I tried to ignore them but they grew to become more intense and intrusive so eventually I decided to look into at home remedies such as stretches, massages and targeting internal pressure points. Many, many pelvic floor therapists stressed the fact I had to be gentle with myself. But I desperately wanted immediate relief.

If anyone has has OCD you know that it's pretty much impossible to ignore even a minor discomfort. Throughout the day, I literally could not stop thinking about the issues that plagued me down below and so I would target them aggressively and nonstop. And as you might have expected... I fucked ruined my vulva. And judging from the google results and reddit threads I've spent hours prowling over, I know there is no fix for this nothing short of cosmetic surgery. The skin on my vaginal opening and my perineum is fucking deflated; shit has lumps in places where it shouldn't be. I rubbed products on my skin that has somehow caused the skin to lighten and become uneven in color. And really, I shouldn't be surprised. Out of desperation I done some pretty risky things to myself that no one with a sane mind would've done. There is literally nothing and no one I can blame for this but myself.

I'm ashamed of what my equipment looks like now. I'm also autistic and had been incredibly unlucky in pursuing relationships, both romantic and platonic and was ready to make my new year's resolution to put myself out there now that I'm medicated and my depression has almost been annihilated.

But I kind of believe that everyone has a path in life, a purpose of sorts. I've been told by many people that I have a compassionate soul, and I deeply valued the relationships I was able to build with people up until now. I even had a couple of chances at dating a few people that I ended up turning down because I wasn't in the right place mentally. Now I'm not in the right place physically. I fucking hate what I have done to my vagina and now know that I can never show it to another person ever in shame. I paved this path for myself and have to make peace with the fact that we rarely live the lives that we want. I'm just not cut out for this shit man.

Happy New Years to me. At least it's helped me come to terms with more realistic exceptions for myself from this point on. I'm just so fucked on the inside and it's finally shown on the outside. I'll stick to living in my mom's basement and fucking e-dating I guess.

I'm not looking for advice or anything. I am well aware that this post may seem dramatic and unhinged to others and if you can't tell, I am a very dramatic and unhinged person myself.

15tshyn,Healthyhooha,1692290047.0,"Hello.  I did a retest (though a urine sample this time) yesterday and I just got my results back.  It turns out I‚Äôm negative for Gonorrhea.  Yay!  I no longer have to worry about the possibility that someone might‚Äôve taken advantage of me while unconscious.

I ended up telling my mother and father about my positive test result before I got retested.  They took it better than I thought they would.  My father believed that I was without a doubt still a virgin and that the test was probably a false positive (he was right).  My mother was kind of skeptical and kept questioning me about whether I had sex, but she said that because ideas about premarital sex have changed and I‚Äôm a grown woman now, she believes that she‚Äôs no longer allowed to control my sex life.  The only person in my household I didn‚Äôt tell was my sister because I didn‚Äôt trust her to not jump to the conclusion that I‚Äôm a ‚Äúwh*re‚Äù due to an incident when she caught me watching porn when I was 13 and told my parents that me watching porn meant that I must be promiscuous.  Maybe that‚Äôs a petty reason because she was 11 at the time, but I didn‚Äôt have to tell her and I didn‚Äôt want to.

After getting so many responses, I should probably address my views on purity culture.  I grew up in a conservative community and household.  My parents never gave me ‚Äúthe talk‚Äù (likely because I‚Äôm autistic), so I learned most of my sex-ed from school with some stuff about non-vanilla sex learned from watching Onision from ages 12 to 15 (I‚Äôm glad I stopped and realized how creepy Onision was and still is).  In school I was taught that abstinence was the only way to prevent STDs, and I knew people (classmates and the children of my parents‚Äô friends) who believed in purity culture.  Like they would call girls who had had premarital sex ‚Äúwh*res‚Äù, and they would even assume that a girl is promiscuous if she dressed in skimpy clothing and/or had large breasts.

Growing up with purity culture definitely affected me in negative ways.  I have larger than average breasts for my frame, so I often wear baggy T-shirts to hide them so that people wouldn‚Äôt sexualize me or make wrong assumptions about me.  While I never started rumors about people or bad-mouthed people, I‚Äôll admit that when I was a teenager, I had misogynistic thoughts about certain people and judged them in similar ways to the people I knew.  I just didn‚Äôt say it out loud because I was a quiet kid who didn‚Äôt like offending people.  Unlimited access to the internet and going to university when I became a legal adult allowed me to learn more about true sex-ed and how protection can be used to avoid STDs.  However, some of harmful beliefs are still engrained in my brain.  As someone who seeks validation and cares about what others think of me, I still have the desire to be seen as a ‚Äúgood girl‚Äù and ‚Äúwife material‚Äù; that‚Äôs my weakness and it has been since I was young.

Even though I no longer care about how other women lead their sex lives, I guess it seems like I still have a part of my judgmental teenage self still with me.  After my STD scare, I now realize that I still have work to do to complete eliminate my harmful beliefs.  I‚Äôm sorry for spreading harmful beliefs about STDs and sex in my previous post.  And thank you to everyone who tried to give me a helpful answer.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/15tshyn/update_i_tested_negative_for_gonorrhea_on_my/,(*Update*) I tested negative for Gonorrhea on my retest,,103,4,0.99,DarkNymphia

s9i4va,WomensHealth,1642791727.0,"Hi, everybody! For those who may remember, I am the girl who went from worrying about whether or not her ovary was still alive to fighting stage 3 ovarian cancer. I know it's been a while, but I have an update I would like to share with you all. 

First off, I am still alive and still in remission! I had my hysterectomy in May. That was quite the ordeal, as there was alot of new things going on in there as a result of it that had to be navigated. I want to give a shoutout to reddit's hysterectomy sub, because they really helped answer so, so many questions and fears as I was recovering.

I have been taking the parp inhibitors as instructed by my doctors as well. We are hoping that me taking it for a while will help my chances of keeping the cancer away; the longer I go without cancer the better my chances, right? As it is, it seems that the main line of defense is monitoring my CA-125 markers, and those have been perfectly fine throughout so we are pretty happy with my results. My main doctor has been ecstatic about my results so far, and so am I! If my March appointments go well, it will be a year in remission! 

My hair is growing back curlier than ever, and I love it...its getting longer all the time! My stomach is slowly returning to its normal functions again, too, and I am starting to see my veins again. I wanna say that I feel like things are back to normal again, but...they aren't. There is a new normal, but for other reasons. 

I have finally gotten to move out! I wanted to for years, but couldn't due to a...well, let's just say less-than-ideal family dynamic. This whole cancer thing caused a huge change in the dynamic, and as time went on I...I've started to be noticed more, you know? Its like I was getting seen for all the things I was trying for, and everybody realized that it was long past time for me to start living my life. 

My new normal is a place of my own. It is enjoying life with my roomates (those best friends who helped me through most of my treatments) and working 2 part-time jobs until I can sort full-time work with my insurance (finally working and LOVING it!!!). It is finally getting to learn to drive and getting ready for my license! It is budgeting my finances and having full control (I am feeling somewhat secure! what a nice feeling). It is starting to get more comfortable buying things. It is visiting my father and us being thrilled to see each other, and me bonding with my baby brother and...and... 

...and being independent. Happy and growing and independent. I'm not where I want to be in life yet...I don't think I'll ever be fully satisfied, because I always want to see how far I can get in life. But I am happier than I have ever been.

lj0nvd,Healthyhooha,1613223354.0,"The 2nd of Tuesday, I went in to have my bladder inflated to check for interstitial cystitis. Instead of making a cut to look inside, the doctor went through my urethra. We did confirm that‚Äôs what I have. However, I‚Äôve still not gotten any word as to why my kidneys are so inflamed and co weed in cysts. 

Anywho, the day after my surgery. I‚Äôm still feeling the slight effects of anesthesia and I had gotten up around 4am to take half of a pain pill and more Tylenol. The surgeons office called to check on me early that morning. Stupid high me was all ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm great‚Äù. Surgeons office was ‚Äúok great‚Äù and hung up. The following hours though...were not great. I began peeing every 5-10 minutes. 4 days ago, I start to bleed. Badly. Worse than any period or after pregnancy period I‚Äôve ever had. Because I‚Äôm bleeding this bad from my urethra. All my vagina can feel is the painful sensation to pee. My pubis bone even hurts. 

I was able to see the doctor yesterday. However, all he could tell me was that I have to do this strict diet for people who have this disease. But here‚Äôs the thing, I can‚Äôt do the diet. I just can‚Äôt. I have digestive and neurological issues as well. The list of foods I‚Äôm to avoid(its 5 pages long). Some of the foods to avoid are my go-to‚Äôs when I feel too bad to eat. But I eat them bc well calories and I need the nutrients. 

From what I‚Äôve been reading though, this bleeding can continue for a long time. I had my period last week, but bc of my hormone issue, I could have another this month. I‚Äôm trying not to freak out bc stress will make this disease worse. However, my lady parts have never ever ever felt this bad. Every second of my life now is revolves around whether or not I need to pee. I can even have sex because of this sensation. 

I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs normal I‚Äôm bleeding this bad. I also find it hard to believe there‚Äôs no other treatment besides a diet. Oh and I‚Äôm to start another diet soon bc my endocrinologist wants to check my adrenal gland. Ugh this is incredibly frustrating. I had hoped, because of the severity of my disease, the doc would have at least given me a few more days of pain meds or muscle relaxers to get through this bleeding. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôd want to stay on, but for fucks sake, I just had surgery and Ive had no time to rest. I have a son. We are also in the middle of finding a Jew place to live bc our home is currently full of lead. To which is poisoning my less than 2 year old son. Life is just crazy right now and it would have been nice to have one less thing to worry so much about. 

Anywho, ladies, I‚Äôd you‚Äôre told you ever need this surgery, maybe ask to be cut on. Bc going through your urethra can really fuck up how you feel down there. This is seriously the worst feeling.

jexppa,TwoXSupport,1603225117.0,"So, the title. Let's start from the beginning, maybe. Yes, let's.

So, I'm supposed to be infertile because of an intersex condition. This includes both having a hard time getting pregnant and having a hard time actually keeping a pregnancy ... possibly also a chance of my pregnancy failing because of chromosomal anomalies (I may or may not be releasing some ova that are 23,Y instead of 23,X, it's hard to tell). However, for some reason that's most certainly related to it it seems that my body is actually quite fertile while on progestin-only birth control, which I take because my body is naturally oestrogen-dominant and that had some unpleasant side effects, and because of this I managed to get pregnant twice while on birth control already.

The first time, it was last year. I was still with my ex back then, mistook implantation bleeding for a weird period, and only learned that I'd been pregnant when I started miscarrying after a bit below two months. Or, no, I actually noticed a day or two before, due to noticing a specific symptom, but either way I didn't really have time to get used to it so ... I won't say it wasn't a big deal, but ... it's alright. Then I had to deal with having milk in my breasts because of course my body had to be weird and have milk after two months of pregnancy. I'd had to switch gynaecologists because of this.

The second time, the second time ... it was on 24th of September, with my boyfriend. I don't need to remember because it's logged in my period tracker. We had sex then, the one time that week. I had an orgasm, too. My ovulation was on 25th. When my period was supposed to come it was weird, off, and this time I knew to not ignore it. I'd had a gut feeling, too. On 13th of October I took a pregnancy test, it was positive.

You see, it would have been a wanted child. I wanted to be pregnant. I wanted to carry to term. I wanted to give my new child a name after it's born, take care of it for the better and for the worse, and ... be a mother. I think my boyfriend would have made a good father, too. But this couldn't happen. Next year, I'm supposed to be getting a surgery to fix my body a bit as it doesn't quite work the way it should because of my intersex condition, and had I actually carried to term at this moment or had I miscarried later but had complications it would have to be rescheduled which it cannot be as I've waited for long enough. Even aside from this, before this point the chances of me not miscarrying aren't good. I'd had pills at home thanks to someone I know being an activist for birth control, and I used them. The night between 15th and 16th was long, and crampy, and I don't want to smell whatever that blood-slime thing was again if I can help it, and not knowing when my next period is going to be or how heavy it will be isn't doing me any good, but ... it's done, and ... it's over.

I am not ‚Äúpro-life‚Äù. I am pro-choice, but openly stated in the past that I wouldn't ever abort unless it was medically necessary. On 15th, hours before the point of no return, I broke down at work, in my boyfriend's arms (we work together), called myself a monster and an abomination, and in general was a wreck. I am better now. I think I am. I know I did the right thing. I'm asking for ... I suppose advice for how to handle this if it hits me at some point in the future.

gmtwri,WomensHealth,1589911927.0,"Hey all, 

Last year I got an abortion in July 2019 through Planned Parenthood in NYC. Due to a lack of health insurance, PP set me up with Medicaid through NYS Dept. of Social Services to cover the cost of the abortion. Since then, I‚Äôve received tons of mail from them but one from September 2019 stuck out amongst the rest.

In the letter window was my last name and address, but not my first name. Instead of my first name, the word ‚ÄúUNBORN‚Äù was there. I immediately went up to my apartment and contacted the NYS Dept. of Social Services and NYS Dept. of Health. Each call led me to another contact number of one of their offices. I explained my case to them and issue with receiving this documentation in the mail where anyone could have accidentally received it and the potential of this unethical ‚Äútypo‚Äù having been distributed to other women in the State. They listened and told me I‚Äôd be contacted by someone in 14 business days. 

That was over 6 months ago. 

Since then, I‚Äôve received more documents that have ‚ÄúUNBORN‚Äù listed within the document as if they were a dependent on my health insurance. Receiving this in the mail has resurged all these feelings of heartbreak, guilt, regret, sadness, and anger that I have been dealing with every day for the past year. This is a direct violation of HIPAA and basic human rights to privacy, especially with a procedure as sensitive as this. My goal is to contact Planned Parenthood, AOC, and many other institutions out there that could help stop this type of mail from going to any woman ever again.

I had 5 yeast infections in 3 months time.

Went to the doctor, vagina looked healthy. Told her I only get it after sex. We have sex, 1 day later I have an infection. Itch, painful vagina opening.

I asked her if my partner is reinfecting me? She asked if he had symptomps. He doesn't. So she said treating him isn't necessary.

She thinks my yeast infections happen due to the bacteria or sperm from my husband. We are together 2 years and it started to happen since 3 months. She said that it's possible and it may be a phase. Her advice was to wash immediately after sex and put Sudocrem Antiseptic Cream on my vagina to prevent itch and so on. 

Anyone else also experienced this? Did this help? And is treating my partner really not necessary, he just can't have no symptomps imo, but the doc said it isn't useful to do.

I went about 2 weeks without having sex with them and I felt great; however, when I had sex with them after those 2 weeks, I got BV again. I stopped having sex with them altogether bc I just didn‚Äôt like them anymore and I was all cleared up from any irritation after a couple weeks.

I started having consistent sex with someone new and I was afraid that I would possibly have irritation again. After a couple months of having sex with this new partner, I haven‚Äôt had any irritation at all.

soo8qh,Healthyhooha,1644441515.0,"Y'all, I am fuming. For the last two years i've been dealing with frequent yeast infections and mystery symptoms that come and go but never seem to fully resolve (burning, discharge, cramping). I have been tested for everything multiple times (including ureaplasma and mycoplasma PCR) everything comes back negative. I have been put on long term anti fungal and been using boric acid which always gets me 90% better, but my issues come back the second I stop. 

Well this week, I went into urgent care to get swabbed for what I thought was a brutal yeast infection. I'm out of ideas as this point, so I asked to be tested for everything again even though I only have one sexual partner. Today I talked to my doctor (who I just recently started seeing). She looked back over my test results for the last two years and told me I have not been testing negative for BV, I've been testing ""inconclusive"" which basically means low grade BV that doesn't quite constitute a full on infection. My symptoms have been consistent with BV THIS WHOLE TIME but the clinic was telling me it was negative and not treating me when I have in fact been returning inconclusive for two years (and actually positive in one case). They have never told me this and unilaterally decided that even though I am symptomatic, theres nothing wrong with me and I don't need antibiotics. The nurse has even told me on multiple occasions that upon examination, there's clearly an infection, which there is, and has been this whole ass time, and its fucking BV.

Interestingly, they treated me for a presumptive case of trich at the beginning of this (which turned out to be negative) with one day of metronidazole which offered me the most relief out of any treatment I've ever had. The one day was not enough to knock out the BV though and it came back about 10 days later.

The amount of time and money I have spent trying to figure this out, paying for private lab tests and private doctors is astounding... So anyway, I'm on my way to pick up my (proper course) of metronidazole now. Here's hoping this is the silver bullet. I'll keep using the boric acid for a while as well.

oyc5da,Healthyhooha,1628146725.0,"Hi. I never thought I‚Äôd get to this point, but I can finally say that I‚Äôm yeast infection-free! This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up. **(TL;DR at bottom)**

While I‚Äôll never know for sure what started it, I‚Äôm almost positive it started when I got the Mirena IUD in 2018, since I‚Äôd never had this issue before then. Almost immediately after I got the IUD, I started getting yeast infections. (I actually saw a tv ad for the Mirena IUD a few weeks ago and the commercial said not to get it if you‚Äôre prone to yeast infections, so I‚Äôm assuming there must be some relationship there?)

I got mixed answers from so many gynos. Some said the IUD can‚Äôt cause yeast infections, some said it could. It was so frustrating not getting any clear answers. I even tried switching to the non-hormonal IUD because I thought maybe the hormones were affecting it, but it didn‚Äôt work. I had the IUD for a year until I finally got it removed. Then I tried the Depo shot, then the arm implant, but the infections still didn‚Äôt go away. If the IUD was the issue, the infections would‚Äôve gone away after I got it removed, right? I was so confused.

I saw more gynos than I can count. I was going to the doctors at least twice a month, but nobody would help me. They just gave me the same vaginal creams I‚Äôd already tried a million times and shoved me out of the office. Nobody listened to me or tried to find the root cause of the issue.

I‚Äôd tried nearly every remedy there is, but nothing worked. Yeast creams, baking soda baths, boric acid, probiotics ‚Äì you name it, I tried it. But the infections kept coming back regardless. The yeast infection creams were the only things that worked (most of the time), but the infection would come back every time. I got tested for EVERYTHING, but I only ever tested positive for yeast and/or BV. I got my thyroid tested, I checked for HIV/AIDS, I got tested for diabetes, etc. But I never had anything‚Ä¶ just yeast.

I became obsessive over my vagina. I‚Äôd constantly monitor it, I‚Äôd Google symptoms for HOURS every day trying to find a possible explanation for my chronic infections, trying to figure out solutions to finally make it stop. I truly think this experience forced me to develop a health-related anxiety about my vagina.

It ruined almost every aspect of my life. It damaged my relationship because I couldn‚Äôt have sex anymore. Sex became very painful since the area was constantly burning and agitated. And I‚Äôd always get a bad infection afterwards. I always had to insert vaginal creams immediately after sex in order to avoid a really bad infection. It also hurt me financially, since yeast infection creams aren‚Äôt cheap, plus I kept having to take time off work to go to doctors appointments. It severely affected my mental health. It made me extremely depressed and anxious.

In 2020, I got my tubes tied, so I finally got off of birth control. I also started seeing a naturopathic doctor. The naturopathic doctor focused on my holistic health, and told me that everything is connected to the vagina, especially the gut. Instead of just focusing on my vagina, like regular doctors would, she focused on my overall health, saying that if my body got healthier, my vaginal health would follow suit.

She started me on the Candida diet. It was really hard to stick with, so I wasn‚Äôt able to do it for long. But the whole experience taught me how to take care of my body. I‚Äôd always been really unhealthy my whole life. I ate a lot of sugar and carbs, and I never exercised. So while I didn‚Äôt stick with the diet and ultimately stopped seeing her, I finally learned how to take care of my physical health.

Also at this time, I left a toxic living situation and I also got a better job, so my life circumstances improved as well, so my mental health also got better. I started feeling happier, and I stopped being so anxious and obsessive about my vagina.

Then, somewhere along the way, I noticed that my vagina hadn‚Äôt been causing issues for a while. I noticed that sex started being pain-free and more pleasurable, and that I stopped getting infections after sex.

For a while, I had this weird experience where I *thought* I had an infection, but I actually didn‚Äôt. I got tested several times and all my results were normal. My therapist told me that since I‚Äôd struggled with this for SO LONG, that it was almost like a phantom infection. She said it sounded like a somatic health anxiety, in which I feel like I have a health issue that‚Äôs not actually there. So she worked with me to help me overcome my health anxiety and to stop excessively worrying about my vagina.

And now, I can fully say that I‚Äôm yeast infection free! It‚Äôs hard to pinpoint what exactly cured it, but I think it‚Äôs everything together ‚Äî getting out of the toxic living situation, finding a job I love, not being so anxious about my health, getting better sleep, exercising and eating healthier, improving my mental health, getting my tubes tied and going off birth control, etc. I think that every aspect of my life had been so unhealthy for years without me realizing it, and it manifested as vaginal infections. And after those infections finally did go away, my brain was tricked into thinking I still had those infections, even though I didn‚Äôt.

I am currently the happiest and healthiest I‚Äôve ever been in my entire life, and my vagina is proof of it! I still get infections every now and then, but I notice that it mainly happens during times when I slack off on taking care of myself (eating healthy specifically). When that happens, I take a 3- or 7-day cream and work hard on getting back on track with the healthy eating and cutting back on sugar and carbs. Then it goes away for a long time!

‚Äî‚Äî

Again, I know this likely won‚Äôt apply to everyone. I, too, scourged this subreddit trying to find answers, and I remember people saying to eat healthier and others in the comments saying that they already do eat healthy and they‚Äôre still having this issue. My heart aches for you and I hope you find a cure soon. I just thought that maybe this might help at least one person, or to at least give hope. I struggled with this for over 2 years, and I‚Äôm living proof that it goes away!

I think the main takeaway I learned is that you have to focus on your overall health, not just your vaginal health. Stress does such weird things to our bodies, so it makes sense that it could affect the vagina as well.

lvxo8a,WomensHealth,1614675386.0,"I just had an IUD insertion procedure scheduled today (March 1st) to get an IUD, the Mirena, in order to help manage some of the pain I have with endometriosis.

It was so horrible I couldn't go through with it.

I turned 19 in January, I've never had sex, my doctor knew I was very nervous and I had a lot of pain and panic when she had done my first check-up, so for the procedure she prescribed me misoprostol, valium, hydrocodone, and ibuprofen. Everything seemed to be fine, I entered the office still nervous but trying to hype myself up, and then as she was about to do the uterine sound before entering the IUD to get a look at the size of my uterus..

She barely got inside of me before I was sobbing and pleading for her to stop. She gave me a bit to relax again and calm down before she tried it a second time, and it just happened again.

I've never cried so much or felt so awful in my life as when she was trying to insert the uterine sound. I didn't even get to the IUD part and it was only a couple hours ago, I still feel so terrible about it all, but the doctor and nurses were so so kind to me. I just kept apologizing and apologizing, and they reassured me that it wasn't my fault at all or anything wrong with me, and I got a birth control shot instead. I cried while getting dressed when I was left alone, and when I got home I cried so hard I just passed out eventually (probably the valium).

I felt so embarrassed, so ashamed, and like I'd wasted her time and all those drugs she gave me to calm down.

I guess I'm looking to feel a little less alone in my experience. Any stories from others or from people who've known people who've had any bad IUD procedure that went wrong, was painful, or they had to stop completely. Please share.

keyo3u,TwoXSupport,1608216228.0,"**TW: sexual abuse/rape (of minors)**

This morning, I was reading the paper while eating breakfast. I come across an article that has a picture of the rink I skate at, so without even reading the title, I open it.

Turns out it's an article about a figure skating coach who raped one of his students (multiple times). The initials and the age correspond with one of the coaches. There's also a picture of the man in question included, and while his face is blurred, I can tell who it is. The name of the girl was a fake one, but she was 14 at the time, 16 now.

She had a crush on him, he used that to his advantage. The rapist saw it as his 'duty' to 'help her discover her sexuality', because 'better with him than with someone else'. He also forced her to take nudes, to make videos of herself masturbating, to watch porn as an example of things she should do to him ... And of course, he told her to do as he said, because otherwise she 'would never make it as a figure skater'.

He has confessed to rape of a minor and possession of child porn. He claimed that while he did threaten her with punishment, everything happened with consent (completely untrue, she clearly says she was afraid and couldn't refuse). The sentence will probably be 4 years probation and a prohibition to a position of power over minors. He was not suspended from the national skating union.

My country is relatively safe, so it's surreal to be confronted with this. I'm abhorred. I'd heard of things like this happening in sports, but so close? Also, I'd never expected this from that guy. But this is not about me, it's about the girl. I don't know who she is (and I don't want to, it's her right to remain anonymous), but I hope she has the support she needs right now.

I guess I just needed to tell the story, even though it's not about me. I'm just so angry and sad that this happened to someone, it being so close to me makes it so real.

k68ach,Healthyhooha,1607035931.0,"Hello fellow vagina owners!

This is my first reddit post but I have been reading the many stories of ladies struggling with what they have been told is a yeast infection, DIV, BV, and sometimes, if they're lucky, CV. I wanted to share with you my story in hopes that maybe there are more of us out there, or if you are at a loss and need some help. Buckle in for a story or skip to the end if you have advice :) 

A year ago I had my very first **UTI**. I was prescribed 5 days of antibiotics (nitrofurantoin) and away it went. But after I got my period a few weeks later, I started to have more discharge than normal accompanied with general uncomfortableness. 2 weeks later it was diagnosed as my first y**east infection** (also tested negative for gonorrhea and chlamydia). But after trying two rounds of **diflucan, 1-Day Monistat, 7-Day Monistat, more diflucan, and more Monistat,** I still felt no relief. 

Visit #2. I went back to the doctor (this time a different one) to explain my story. They immediately suspected yeast and prescribed me **MORE diflucan** (even though I repeatedly said it wasn't working) but I figured I'd give it another try. No relief. 

Visit #3 (this was over the phone). They **suspected DIV** (but with no real proof) and put me on **clindamycin** for 28 days, once a day. It was miserable and didn't help me at all!

Visit #4. They suspected a **hormonal imbalance** (again, with no real proof) and put me on **estrogen** cream twice weekly for 28 days (insanely expensive but a rant for another day). I will say this helped SLIGHTLY but I still felt horrible. 

Visit #5. They performed **a biopsy on my labia** and **suspected lichen sclerosis** (again, this didn't quite make sense given my age, but did slightly match my symptoms). Very scary experience but I was at a loss for what to do after months of confusion and pain. They also prescribed **clobetasol propionate**. When the results came back a few days later, it wasn't lichen sclerosis but psoriasis (again, this didn't make sense - this does not run in my family and usually doesn't show up \*there\* first, if ever). But, I continued on with the CP ointment at the advice of my doctor, as she said this would help if not heal me. 

Visit #6. At my follow-up with my doctor post-biopsy, she said I was looking a lot better - but let me tell you I wasn't feeling better. But she had me taper of the ointment because of its potency, especially for that area of my body. 

I had absolutely plateaued. After tapering of the ointment, I felt no better but no worse. I was ready to give up. Apparently, so was my doctor, because when I reached out to her she told me to see a dermatologist. I was still convinced that this was a vaginal issue, but felt like I had no where else to turn. I was finally able to see a **dermatologist** last month, and that's when the tables started turning!

Visit #1. The minute she started my exam, she suspected yeast. I had so much discharge that looked like yeast that she said she couldn't really do my exam thoroughly! She prescribed me 10 days of diflucan, and told me to do monistat-7 again. I figured it was worth a shot and made a follow-up appointment as requested.

Visit #2. It felt like things had gotten worse! Not as much discharge but still extremely red, swollen, and uncomfortable. So my dermatologist suggested doing **another biopsy,** because she said the first set of results were very hard for her to draw any conclusions from. Yikes! But I said okay because at this point I was so desperate for answers.

Shockingly, the results of the second biopsy showed an **abundance of lactobacillus, or Cytolytic Vaginosis.** They were able to see this from the biopsy, but my gyno NEVER mentioned this! Not once! This biopsy also RULED OUT psoriasis. Strange!

The results said that CV is most likely the root of all of my problems. I'm shocked at the lack of information about this, and the fact that a lot of doctors don't even believe you can have too much ""good"" bacteria. Be warned!

**A lot of the info I have been able to find on this says to douche with baking soda, but I thought it was really bad to douche. I don't want things to go too badly in the other direction. I have started doing sitz baths, but I'm not sure how often to do them.**

ft65om,Healthyhooha,1585767256.0,"Some background: I'm 22, f, and I'm currently going through the process of being tested for this after going through a nightmarish few months with a yeast infection that refused to respond to 3 rounds of diflucan. I used 2 weeks of boric acid which seemed to get rid of the yeast but I'm still feeling irritation, burning and even pain in my urethra, and all the other symptoms of urea/mycoplasma. And yes I do all the healthy vag stuff, probiotics, vitamin c, lots of water, cotton undies, no sex, no masterbation, the whole 9 yards and nothing has seemed to restore everything back to normal.
I'm confident its either one because this all started when I started seeing some new in January, and i noticed his penis had quite a stank... even though he claimed to shower right before which I believed him since his hair would be wet. This is not normal for YI to last this long for me, and I tested negative for all STDs, bv etc. I called my gyno to request the testing for the urea/myco and they said they ""highly doubt I have it"" and are going to test for a UTI first, and if it comes back negative then they'll go from there.

16rbf1k,Healthyhooha,1695595920.0,"I heard something recently about how hitachi magic wand users can have decreased clitoral sensitivity because that vibrator is so intense. I‚Äôve used one of those for like 5+ years, and recently switched back to a regular vibrator. Before I had a magic wand I‚Äôve always used some sort of vibrator to masturbate. 

I can‚Äôt orgasm from oral, and sometimes even fingers rubbing my clit feels like nothing or it just doesn‚Äôt feel as good as a vibrator.

I know some women cum from oral very easily but I‚Äôve only ever been able to once and it took 45 minutes to get there. Honestly I kind of prefer piv sex to foreplay type of stuff (aside from a vibrator) because it‚Äôs more stimulating to me.

I‚Äôve seen posts on here before discussing syntribation and how some women can only cum doing that. Is it just like however you start masturbating is how you ‚Äúprogram‚Äù your body?

r7952b,WomensHealth,1638456744.0,"So generally menstrual cycles are supposed to be between 21 and 35 days. I was averaging 38 days. The periods themselves were long (6 days of heavy bleeding and another 6 of progressively lighter bleeding). My PMS was so bad I would venture to call it PMDD although this was never formally diagnosed. I would get severely depressed and so physically exhausted that I would fall asleep in public places. My breasts would become incredibly swollen and painful that just walking was too much. Taking a bus ride has brought tears to my eyes from going over the bumps. My skin broke out awfully each month.

Doctors were not helpful and, after checking my thyroid, gave me the usual spiel of ‚Äúsome women just have long cycles‚Äù and recommended birth control.

At some point for an unrelated reason I got a nutrition test done, and it identified I was deficient in vitamin D3. Oh, but I‚Äôm already taking vitamin D, maybe I need more? So, I go about searching for how much should I take.

YOU GUYS

Vitamin D deficiency is treated with an injection of 300,000 IU, followed by maintenance of 2000 IU per day. I was taking only a 200 IU tablet each day! Once my vitamin D deficiency was resolved several things happened:

* More energy generally
* I used to catch colds and get sick *all the time,* no more.
* 29-day average cycle
* My period lasts 4 days with only spotting on the 5th day
* No super painful breasts (PMS)
* No super exhaustion (PMS)
* Reduced skin breakouts (PMS)
* Depression significantly improved (PMS and other times)

kfac66,TwoXSupport,1608252191.0,"I‚Äôve been watching a series about the Yorkshire ripper on Netflix - he was a serial killer active from 1975 - 80. My mum was living and working around his hunting ground as a young woman - was even allowed to leave work early in the winter - it was a scary time for women (when isn‚Äôt it?) 

The police officers (all men iirc) treated the victims appallingly imo. It got me thinking that to an extent, their views on women were not much different to the Ripper‚Äôs. 

The blatant judgement and misogyny directed at the victims who were prostitutes was disgusting. The only ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù victims (according to the police and media) were the women and girls who were ‚Äúrespectable‚Äù and who weren‚Äôt ‚Äúof loose morals‚Äù - yep, the women who were brutally murdered were actually referred to this way. It breaks my heart. 

It concerns me that it is primarily men (still, to this day, who make up majority of police, of prosecutors, of judges, of parliamentarians) who must catch and convict the perpetrators of gendered violence - how many of these men harbour their own twisted views about women and women‚Äôs sexuality? 

Why are prostitutes and sex workers (still!) treated with such distain and disgust yet the men who frequent them are not? Why are women branded ‚Äúwhores‚Äù but not the men who constantly pester and harass them for sex? Why does a woman who enjoys sex have ‚Äúloose morals‚Äù ? A prostitute who has to put food on the table is ‚Äúof loose morals‚Äù but the (frequently married, family) men who give her their money are not? 

And this happened 20 years before I was born...but I‚Äôm still afraid to walk in the dark. Still women are shamed for their sexuality. Still rape victims are asked ‚Äúwhat were you wearing/how much did you drink?‚Äù and told they were ‚Äúasking for it‚Äù 

I guess the point of all this is when will the blame and burden be shifted from the victims onto those who perpetrate violence? Why is it always women‚Äôs fault and women‚Äôs responsibility. Why, time and time again, is male violence, harassment and misogyny excused and ignored?

lbwtuo,WomensHealth,1612382796.0,"Hi everyone. I'm 23 years old, and last week I had my second Bartholin's cyst, and this post is going to be about my time with it. It will be long, but it will contain everything about my experience.

# First cyst

I had my first Bartholin's cyst 3-4 years ago, during my undergrad years. I don't remember many symptoms from then, just that it hurt to sit. It happened after my period, so I did not go to the doctor in the first few days thinking it was probably rash from the pads (some always pads have really plasticky material, causing rashes sometimes). After I noticed a bump down there (base of the vagina, at the bottom), I went to a gynaecologist, and she prescribed pain meds, a topical ointment (an antibacterial cream I believe) and an oral antibiotic. I remember the pain was not extremely horribly bad, but quite bad still. I do not remember what side my first cyst was on.

# Second cyst

Cut to 23rd of January, I am at my friend's house for a party (small thing, only 4 people, COVID is still very much a thing) and it hurts to sit. At this point, I could sort of do a shuffle in the seat and find some comfortable position. It was not bad (I got ready for the party by sitting down on the floor, albeit with some discomfort) and walked a lot on the day too. However, when I get home, the pain is quite a bit. It hurt to walk and sit. I informed my mom about it, changed out of my clothes into loose pants, and decided I'd go to the doctor the next day. I had not taken any pills yet, I just put some fucidin (an antibacterial cream) on the spot that hurt, as I could not see a bump clearly yet. Even still, I thought it was a Bartholin's cyst as my symptoms matched and I learned that its a recurring thing (the joy!). All this time, I was on my period (this is important, as it fucked up my diagnosis and treatment later). 

Sunday, 24th of January, I go to the doctor, a GP, at my university clinic. I went to her because they do not have any consultation fee (I do not have insurance), and I have been to her and my experience has been mediocre, not amazing but hey, it's free, and I need to save money. This was my fuck up. ***DO NOT GO TO THE GP. DO NOT GO TO ANYONE ELSE BUT A GYNAECOLOGIST.*** She could not take a look as I was on my period, however I told her I had a BC before and it is probably that. She thinks so too from my symptoms, gives me Mupirocin and sends me on my merry way, telling me to come back after my period finishes. Now see, that day I am not dying in pain, but it is bad enough that I went home early and did not finish my work at uni (I work as a researcher in the lab, and did not have it in me to stand/sit for long). I came home, and for the next day (my period ended Tuesday), I put on the cream and it BURNS. After 4 applications (2 on Sunday, 2 on Monday) I noticed that the pain always **worsens** after I put on the cream, so I stopped. 

Tuesday, 26th of January, I have a small bump, and I go to the doctor again. She does a physical exam, and I say this very loosely because she just saw the bump, did not feel around it or anything. She told me its just an infected sebaceous cyst, that she does not know why I am saying I am in so much pain, its nothing big and that it will be resolved with the same treatment. I told her the cream worsened it, so she gave me a prescription for medium strength Tylenol and fucidin (which my mom gave me before she did, and which I already had). I did not end up getting either since I had both at home. That day, and all the days after until Saturday, can only be described as pure hellish agony. I had started to do sitz baths from Tuesday (with some salt in it), and nothing helped. I started warm compresses as well, which gave 2% momentary relief. I could not sleep through the night, paracetamol or ibuprofen was not helping.

Wednesday, 27th of January, I am in horrible horrible horrible pain. My mom decides enough is enough, she was already very angry at the GP for not giving me oral antibiotics and I clearly was not in the right frame of mind to argue against what she said (the way she brushed off my pain was very, very hurtful). I go with her to the gynaecologist, and she confirms what I thought, it is a bartholin cyst, and I tell her my history and she confirms that I am very likely to get one again. Bless her heart, she treated me and my insecurities (I kept saying 'I know it's not big, it just hurts very much, I know its not a big deal' which she immediately shut down) and gave me an oral antibiotic (Azord), serratiopeptidase, voltaren rectal suppositories for the pain, and told me to go ahead with the fucidin and sitz baths. She also saw the horrible pain I was clearly in, I couldn't sit for longer than 5-10 minutes without having to yell in pain, and gave me a shot of voltaren. I was in heaven for 7 hours after. I stopped wearing underpants from this day to let my babybox breathe.

Thursday, 28th of January, my cyst increases in size. I spent half of the first sitz bath that day just plain crying. Crying at the fact that it was bigger, and crying at the fact that nothing helped with the pain. Truly horrible. I wouldn't wish this pain on anyone. I was in bed for most of the day. Couldn't even move without screaming in pain, my mom helped me walk to the dinner table, to the bathroom etc.

Friday, 29th of January, holy fucking fuck. Friday. What I'd say was the most horrible day of them all. Couldn't even get out of bed. Couldn't sleep through the night, woke up multiple times crying in pain. Had lunch in bed, even the most minute movement seemed to send a jolt of pain. I go to the toilet to do another sitz bath, and I notice a tiny spot of liquid on my trousers - my cyst had finally burst! the smell was horrendous, pus and blood came out of that cyst like thats all I was producing. But it was not a steady stream or one big explosion (idk why I expected that haha), it was a continuous discharge over the next day. I was in contact with a doctor friend of mine the whole time, and she said because I was absolutely dying in pain rn, I could take ibuprofen (200 mg, thats all I had), and 500 mg paracetamol together, ***BUT THIS IS ONLY FOR VERY EXTREME PAIN AND DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT BE PRACTICED ANY OTHER TIME***. This worked wonderfully for the pain, and I put on underwear and a pantyliner again which I constantly changed as she advised me not to let the pus get anywhere else. I spent the rest of the evening pain free due to the cocktail and with pus leaking out of me like a leaky faucet you can never quite close.

Saturday and Sunday will be coupled into one. I could not do a lot of walking and really regretted going to uni on Sunday (I walked a bit too much), but I felt soooooooooo much better than the past few days. After the cyst burst, there was discomfort for the next 3 days (Saturday, Sunday and Monday), but the pain was gone. On Monday I went to the doctor again, and she gave me the all clear.

Now, I have a hemorrhoid (yay! I also have IBS, so not shocking that I have some sort of GI related issue every once in a while), but babybox wise, everything is ok Alhumdulillah. I am continuing the sitz baths for the hemorrhoid. 

# The Take Away

* Don't go to the ER, GP, please. Just go to the gynaecologist.
* GET PAIN MEDS. ASK THEM FOR PAIN KILLERS. Your pain is valid. Your needs are valid. Don‚Äôt let the doctors tell you it‚Äôs not. 
* Get oral antibiotics. The topical stuff won‚Äôt help. If I had the oral ones from the get go, it wouldn‚Äôt have hurt as bad and it would have healed faster.
* Wear loose, breathable clothing. Go underwear less until it bursts, then add a pantyliner and underwear and keep changing the pantyliner. 
* A point I wanted to add: I did not try any home remedies (prid salve, witch hazel etc) as I do not love in the US and acquiring these would have been much harder for me. 

# The Treatments I Used

* Fucidin (antibiotic cream). Application after every sitz bath.
* Azord (oral antibiotic)
* Serodase (serratiopeptidase)
* Panadol (paracetamol) and Advil (ibuprofen) for the pain - Voltaren suppositories did nothing for me. 
* Sitz bath for 25-30 minutes in warm-hot water
* Warm compresses for most of the day

# For the Next Time

My doctor was kind enough to give me additional azord, and advised me to start taking it right away the next time I have the symptoms again. I am also prepared with the pain killers, and the sitz bath and warm compresses.

ekcq1v,Healthyhooha,1578229222.0,"I posted a few weeks ago about some issues I‚Äôve been having for years with BV-like symptoms despite testing negative for BV. Basically my vagina was lacking certain lactobacilli strains that are responsible for producing H2O2, which helps regulate pH. Nothing much changed since then, until I got prescribed doxycycline for my acne. 

I remembered reading on here that doxycycline is a common treatment for Ureaplasma, which I thought might explain my mysterious symptoms but had not gotten around to being tested for yet. I took the medicine as prescribed for my acne, and after a few days I didn‚Äôt notice any change in my vagina, so I figured it wasn‚Äôt Ureaplasma and continued the treatment. 

Well, after about 10 days of treatment, I noticed the smell had decreased a lot. In fact, I was traveling and even after two days of not showering (no time, hectic schedule, etc.) it STILL didn‚Äôt really smell, something which was unheard of for me. It has been over a week now, and it has not come back, even after starting my period, which would ALWAYS ruin any progress I was having with probiotics or whatever else. 

There is a little bit of a sweaty smell at the end of the day, but I think that‚Äôs normal (this has been going on for so long that I really don‚Äôt know what can even be considered normal). I still have to take the doxycycline for two more months for acne, and I am hoping that after I finish this course the smell doesn‚Äôt come back. 

If it was indeed Ureaplasma and the doxycycline cured it, it would be a miracle. It‚Äôs been literally YEARS that I‚Äôve had this issue (seriously, like 13 years). I don‚Äôt want to get too hopeful just yet; I will update once I finish my course of antibiotics, but I really hope this isn‚Äôt a dud! Fingers crossed!

14wj7a8,Healthyhooha,1689057429.0,"I am a female in my mid 20‚Äôs and for about 10 years I‚Äôve been getting these ‚Äúcysts‚Äù in the same exact spot and I‚Äôm so exhausted I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore.

 It always happens in my inner labia on the left side very close to my clit. It can be anywhere from a pea to a very large grape. Sometimes it‚Äôs round, sometimes it‚Äôs kinda ovular shaped. But it‚Äôs always in the exact same spot. And it always happens after I either have rough sex or I have sex with a guy who has a big üçÜ. 

Ive gone to so many gynecologists over the years and even had consults from plastic surgeons. One gyno I went to invited every other gyno doctor in the building to come into my exam room all at the same time and one by one they took turns looking at, squeezing, pushing on, examining, discussing what an unusual unbeknownst cyst-like thing I had. They litterally were therorizing together right infront of me and ruling out things they thought it could be. Aside from the fact of what an uncomfortable experience that was. It was more so just disheartening that no one knows what‚Äôs wrong with me. The cysts are INCREDIBLY painful. When I have one I can‚Äôt sit, walk, run, or cross my legs. 

I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs an ingrown hair‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. Hair does not grow where the cyst is. 

I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs a bartholin cyst‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not at the opening of my vagina. It‚Äôs very high up. Like a centimeter from my clit. 

I‚Äôve been told to use more lube when having sex‚Ä¶ I could be Niagara Falls and it still happens.

I‚Äôve been told to have sex with men who are smaller‚Ä¶ I have no words for that one.

I‚Äôve been told to ‚Äútell your partner to be gentle‚Äù ‚Ä¶ even if every guy was interested in having slow boring sex every time‚Ä¶ how uncomfortable to preface the first time having sex with ‚Äúplease be gentle I get painful cysts next to my clit‚Äù. No. That‚Äôs unrealistic, embarrassing, unsexy, and not to mention forces me to sacrifice my own pleasure. 

I‚Äôve been offered to have the gland surgically removed with the risk of nerve damage and especially so close to my clit. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to have someone cut into me and risk that to remove something NOBODY EVEN HAS A NAME FOR, something no one can even tell me why exactly this happens, another way to treat it, or what it even is for that matter. 

In the MANY MANY MANY MANYYYYY times I‚Äôve had them no matter how BIG and excruciating they can be, they have never formed a head or any kind of opening for that matter, and never drained externally. Despite my warm compresses, hot baths, & sits baths. When they go away they seem to drain internally somehow as it just gets gradually smaller. The bump is hard and it‚Äôs under flat skin, almost like I can move it around underneath the skin. 

There‚Äôs no way I can squeeze it. If you‚Äôre a man  reading this, imagine putting a little balloon in your dick hole, inflating it and trying to pop the balloon. That‚Äôs how bad it hurts even attempting to pinch it lightly is excruciating.

They usually last between 5-10 days but there have been a few times it took almost 2/3 weeks to go away.

Yesterday I literally took a shower before I had sex & my partner had also taken a shower a little while earlier than me. We were both clean. It was not hot. In fact his house was freezing so I was not sweating. The sex was a little rough but then again I could have far rougher sex 10 other times in and it not happen at all. 

It‚Äôs happened with multiple different partners.

10lqagf,Healthyhooha,1674734728.0,"It took 6 long, terrible months but I finally kicked my bv and I wanted to share it with you vagina owners as I‚Äôve been secretly browsing this community for awhile to find some guidance, and I want to help someone else if I possibly can. Sorry for the length but it‚Äôs been a journey! 

July 2022 thought I had a yeast infection as I had symptoms that were similar to past yeast infections: pencil shaving type discharge, mild irritation, mild itchiness, no odor. Had a vaginal swab done that revealed it was bv - atopobium vaginae, megasphaera 1. Never had bv prior to this. Was prescribed 5 day flagyl suppositories. The symptoms did not go away. Called my provider and was prescribed oral flagyl, still the symptoms persisted. Now, by this point, I‚Äôm having pelvic pain on both sides.

Had a transvaginal ultrasound done that was unremarkable. I take a small break from antibiotics to try oral/vaginal probiotics and boric acid. Jarrow/femdolphius/walgreens brand probiotics I took by mouth and also transferred to vegetable capsules and inserted were not successful. I tried a cvs brand boric acid that would work for like a day or two, honeypot boric acid was effective but again for only like 2-3 days. 

The mild irritation and itchiness goes away but this pencil shaving type discharge and pelvic pain persist. The pelvic pain was very weird and was most prominent after my period ended, it would literally switch from one side to the next each month. I go to a gynecologist and explain my situation and ask for oral clindamycin as I saw that has helped a few people, had a swab done that confirmed I still had bv so I take it and it actually worked! I was so relieved and happy and thought my nightmare was over but nope, the symptoms returned 2-3 weeks later.

I continue taking probiotics but only sparingly as they weren‚Äôt working that great, but mostly use the boric acid as it did give me relief for a couple days. I also tried vagibiom suppositories/balance activ gel/VH essential gels/suppositories-  they weren‚Äôt successful. I then ask the gynecologist for another round of oral clindamycin as it was effective before and again, it works, but just shortly. By this point I don‚Äôt want to take anymore antibiotics and I thought maybe I was messing with my vagina too much and tried just leaving it alone for awhile to heal on its own. Nope, that doesn‚Äôt work either. 

November I take an Evvy test. Results came back a month later and revealed 72% L. Iners, 21% L. Crispatus and other lactobacillus. Was told to take optibalance probiotics/lactoferrin. Let me just add that throughout this whole ordeal I was a pretty heavy drinker/eating very terribly and slightly overweight.

After the holidays I decide to try the recommended probiotic/lactoferrin and I quit alcohol and began to start exercising regularly and eating much healthier plus increasing my water intake.

It works. Like, it sounds so simple but massive diet changes and no alcohol and losing some weight got rid of the horrible discharge and pelvic pain in just a couple weeks and has not returned. I‚Äôm still taking this probiotic as well. 

I hope this maybe helps someone, I‚Äôm still on this journey and staying vigilant but I‚Äôve noticed great improvement and I‚Äôm so grateful for this community support.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/10lqagf/cured_my_bv/,Cured my BV!,,97,25,0.99,PWren16
1027gpp,Healthyhooha,1672750430.0,"Mini UTI is not a medical term, but it's the best descriptor I have for this experience.

I've had plenty of UTIs in my life. I was a slow learner when it came to peeing after sex and my ex was a little unhygienic. I've had only one in the last three years (thank god) but I know how they feel. I've never been wrong when I feel one, i know exactly what it is. For me, when they come, they'll wake me up out of a dead sleep and it's like, ""Fuck, now I have to deal with this today."" I've never been able to flush one out with water or cranberry juice; I've always had to beat them into submission with AZO and finish them off with a week of antibiotics. 

But sometimes this happens: Last night, I was meal prepping for the week. I'd been cleaning all day because I ignored all household maintenance during the holidays. So I was up and down the stairs and all over the place all day, no UTI symptoms. Wearing clean cotton underwear, loose pants, maybe a little sweaty from housework or the heat from the stove? But not grungy. And drinking water all day as I went.

All of a sudden, BOOM, urgency. I run to the bathroom to pee, it's very little, and it doesn't burn but it's got that very recognizable tingle. When I'm done, I don't feel done. I immediately feel like I have to pee again. I eventually clean up, go back to cooking, and that's it. No UTI, just a threat??

I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for 6 months now and during the early part of our relationship we were very sexually active, however over the past 3 months I haven‚Äôt really felt in the mood to participate. It first started with me engaging in sexual acts just to please him as I felt guilty because he would always ‚Äútest‚Äù my no and proceed to constantly get angry or upset with me if I didn‚Äôt do anything, until I eventually give in. 

This continued for a while and I am just not interested at all anymore. I have began to tell him this clearly well in advance by saying things like ‚Äúwe are not having sex tonight‚Äù, or ‚Äúplease do not touch me tonight‚Äù and in the end it always leads to some form of sexual encounter. I have had a conversation with him about this before and he had said to me ‚Äúit‚Äôs because you send me mixed signals like when you wear short shorts or take off your shirt when your hot‚Äù. I had explained to him that none of these gestures indicate to wether or not I would like to have sex, but I also took extra precautions by telling him things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing shorts because it‚Äôs hot not because I want to have sex‚Äù 

over time these acts had started to make me uncomfortable but I still love him however, something that had happened yesterday has really upset me.

I‚Äôm moving apartments and my mom was helping me because she‚Äôs a great mom. But I was lifting a heavy box and she was telling me how I should have used smaller lighter boxes because women shouldn‚Äôt lift too much or they‚Äôll strain their lady parts and have trouble having children‚Ä¶.. what. I‚Äôd literally never heard this before and it makes no sense. Serena Williams is gloriously built and I‚Äôm pretty sure she has a kid. I don‚Äôt think she has that figure from going light on the weights.

Edit: thanks to everyone who pointed out the nugget of truth to this! I did end up going to check out the correlation between heavy lifting and pelvic floor for women. I found an article, it basically said that when women are taught to lift correctly there‚Äôs likely no harm to your pelvic floor. Some kinds of weight lifting can help your pelvic floor, but some breathing exercises that female athletes participate in can cause pelvic floor damage. So women generally have more stuff to damage when exercising incorrectly.

There‚Äôs a summary paragraph at the bottom, but this part sums it up pretty well too:

‚ÄúThese findings positively support weightlifting without risk to the PFMs and suggest it is the duration of exposure to resistance training that initiates PFD symptoms rather than the actual weight lifted. It also appears that there is an individual threshold of IAP related to the athlete‚Äôs risk:benefit ratio(10). If taught to lift correctly, female athletes can tolerate large increases in IAP without experiencing UI or POP‚Äù

There‚Äôs not much information on Bartholin Cysts out there and even fewer positive stories, so here‚Äôs mine. Please feel free to ask any questions!

NOVEMBER 2019 - CYST 1

I got my first Bartholin Cyst on my left side back in November of 2019. I was absolutely horrified and didn‚Äôt know what it was because I had never seen swelling like that in that area and also had no idea the Bartholin Gland even existed. It was about the size of a walnut when I found it and went to my OBGYN 4 days later to get it excised and drained. She numbed me up, made a small incision, drained it completely, and I went on. There was no lingering pain with the incision and drainage and I was even working out again the next day.

NOVEMBER 2020 - CYST 2

For the entire next year after my first cyst I had ZERO issues. It never swelled back up, no pain, and no sign of any recurring cyst. BUT I knew that Bartholin Cyst‚Äôs had high recurrence rates so I kept my eye out. Surely enough, almost exactly 1 year later, a cyst returned on the same left side. I tried everything from sitz baths 3-5x a day, Epsom salts, compresses, tea tree, witch hazel, PRID, serrapeptase; literally anything you can find for a home remed, I tried it with no luck. I couldn‚Äôt even get the cysts to form a head even though it grew to the size a bit larger than a golf ball. So, I went and got it incised and drained again, but at a new doctor since I had moved. This doctor recommended a word balloon catheter but I was leaving the country a week later and didn‚Äôt want to deal with it so I went without. Cyst #2, gone.

DECEMBER 2020 - CYST 3

About 1 month later I felt something starting to grow again in the area where I get my cysts and knew it was coming back. I went to my original OBGYN again and she said it looked like the previous OBGYN that had just drained it didn‚Äôt get it all. She had to make a deeper incision to drain it all of the way. Then, she tried to insert the word balloon catheter to let it continue to drain but the incision was so large that the balloon wouldn‚Äôt stay inside. So, another incision and drained completed and another cysts gone.

MARCH 2021 -CYST 4

This is where it gets interesting. This cyst came back again in March and I realized they were starting to recur faster and more frequently. As soon as I saw this one starting I kept up with the home remedies- having no luck for 3 weeks as it grew to the size of a tennis ball. No joke. I luckily never felt extreme amount of pain with these cysts as they never abscessed but they would get very large. This time was different as the cyst finally came to a head and it ruptured on its own. Instant relief. My doctor told me to keep up sitz baths to help with healing. 

After this cyst is when I stated to truly contemplate a permanent fix. The typical options are the catheter (couldn‚Äôt get it to stay in), marsupialization (I decided was not the route I wanted to take due to high recurrence rate even after the procedure), or excision of the entire gland (basically a permanent fix if your doctor can remove the entire gland during the procedure).

I wanted to go for the gland excision surgery. My doctor agreed with me but said that we would first wait and see if it came back again after it ruptured itself as it could have left a big enough of an opening to continually drain. 

MAY 2021 - CYST 5

The cyst came back again and I was over it. I called my doctor up and scheduled my gland excision surgery for September 2021.

This cyst in May ended up rupturing on its own again after growing to the size of tennis ball.

SEPTEMBER 2021 - GLAND EXCISION SURGERY

I will preface this by saying that I did not take this procedure lightly and was terrified to go under. I had read ever horrible story out there about this surgery and everything I read said it was an awful and painful recovery. I was scared but knew it would be worth it to not have to worry about it again.

So, just this past Tuesday (September 14) I went under and had my left Bartholin Gland removed. The surgery took just over an hour and I went home later that day to rest.

SURGERY RECOVERY

I realize I‚Äôm only a couple days out of this surgery but I‚Äôve had such a positive experience that I never found online beforehand that I need to share.

The entire time after my surgery I have not had any pain higher than a 5 on a 10 scale. I‚Äôve been keeping up with the pain meds but stopped them today (Thursday) as I have a 0/10 pain.

I can get up, walk, sit to pee, and slew comfortably. I feel stronger each day and know I‚Äôll be back to a normal and cyst-free life soon!

MY TAKEAWAY

Everyone‚Äôs experiences with this surgery is valid and their own but I wanted to share my very positive experience with a very scary surgery that has limited information out there about it.

If you‚Äôre struggling with these cysts I encourage you to seek treatment that will be best for your long-term mental and physical health and know that each experience is personal; don‚Äôt base your decision based off of what you‚Äôve heard other people through.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/ppmygr/positive_bartholin_cyst_gland_excision_surgery/,POSITIVE Bartholin (Cyst) Gland Excision Surgery and Bartholin Cyst Journey (ask me anything),,99,51,1.0,toe_rye
pchte3,WomensHealth,1630045859.0,"Sorry for the PSA! I'm sure moderators will remove if this isn't allowed, but knowledge is power. 

Many of us women learned about puberty in school while some didn't. But have you ever been taught anything about perimenopause and menopause? I never learned much about other than the super basics of menopause you no longer have periods or release eggs and that you get hot flashes and moodiness. I never heard about perimenopause. 

You'll find of lot of conflicting information out there or sights listing the short basic lists of symptoms. Take it all with a grain of salt.

Two years ago, depression, anxiety and nightsweats crept up on me. I was put on antidepressants and anxiety medication. Had trouble sleeping and staying asleep. I was put on medication to help with that. Joint and muscle aches, headaches, migraines, moodiness, irritability, tingling hands and feet, brain fog, forgetfulness, inability to concentrate or focus, etc... On and off other symptoms pop up, went away or stayed. Had 1 or 2 actual hot flashes that lasted a few minutes. My husband and I thought it sounded like menopause. Average age of menopause is 51 and I was only 41. My general doctor suspects it's perimenopause. I recently went to see a specialist because my symptoms arent getting better. She refused to listen to me because 1) I was too young and 2) I was still on birth control. She totally dismissed me and told me to get my thyroid checked. I have multiple times in the past 2 years, labs are all good for my thyroid. 

I then learned about perimenopause. It can start as early as your early 40s, but I believe the average is 45ish. It can last from 2 to 10 years. What???? Perimenopause is the TRANSITION to menopause. You have whacky periods and menopause symptoms. Menopause is when you have officially had zero periods for 12 months. You remain in menopause for the rest of your life. Every women experiences it differently. Some have severe symptoms, some have moderate, some have it lightly, and there's a lucky group that never feels the transition. 

But guess what! Not all doctors get much training on the subject in medical school. At lot of women start peri, have symptoms, and see their doctor just to be told that you are too young and that's not possible. Wrong! But do take that with a grain of salt again. It might not be peri. Thyroid problems are more common in women and share a lot of the same annoying symptoms as peri, so it's important to get it checked. There are also vitamin and mineral deficiencies that can cause problems too. I was deficient in D and it was way worse than what articles on the internet said.

Keep in mind that birth control pills can mask the symptoms and you might not even know you had started peri. 

Anyways, [here's one of many articles on the internet](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-the-34-symptoms-of-menopause) that you might find helpful.

[Menopause Barbie /Menopause Taylor](https://youtu.be/SLkhB7WbxRs) 
has a ton of YouTube videos regarding the topic. She is a highly qualified doctor that specializes in it. She's really wacky and takes time getting used to her style. I watch her videos on x1. 5 or 1.75 speed because she talks slow and does repeat herself. She describes the process as reversed puberty. 

I've been in limbo with this right now. My symptoms are making work very difficult to do. I'm continuing to see different doctors to make sure I get the correct diagnosis. My gut instincts says it's peri, but my horrible anxiety says what if it's something worse. 

I hope this helps anyone out there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/pchte3/please_educate_yourself_about_perimenopause_and/,Please educate yourself about perimenopause and menopause before it happens to you.

p09fl7,Healthyhooha,1628403225.0,"Hi guys, someone requested I repost this because my original post was deleted for containing a link üò¨

Sooo... my story is a really hard one. Along my UTI journey, I was made SO sick from antibiotics & probiotics that at one point, I couldn't walk or eat food. I want to share what finally worked for me.

First, let's talk about what didn't work. I am not saying these things don't work for others, but they were not enough to get rid of the infections for ME. I tried antibiotics (and became resistant), peeing after sex, washing before & after sex, cranberry juice, drinking lots of water, AZO, D-mannose, probiotics, and eating fermented foods.

After doing a TON of research, I found out that there is a medication called **Hiprex** that is sold over the counter in Australia to prevent UTIs! In the US, you can get it by asking your GP to prescribe ""methenamine hippurate."" Basically, it is a substance that turns to formaldehyde in the bladder and it flushes bacteria out of the urinary tract. Hiprex does not build bacterial resistance, and it does not affect the microbiome of the vagina or the gut. Some people pair it with vitamin C to increase effectiveness.

It took about 4-6 months of not having sex to get rid of the initial burning in the bladder and urethra. Hiprex then worked preventatively after that! It doesn't fix active infections, but it can prevent, and the world experts on UTIs often pair it with other treatments! I haven't had a UTI in over a year!

Once it worked, I was so baffled that no doctor ever brought it up to me before. I'd do anything to go back in time and give it to myself after my first UTI. It would have saved me from going through SIBO, SIRS, and heavy metal poisoning from a scan I got for my digestive issues. I hope post this can help others out there!!!

TLDR: Hiprex/methenamine cured me. No UTI in over a year!

ALSO: UTIs can be caused by yeast, too. If you have had a lot of antibiotics and yeast infections, you can get fungal UTIs, which happened for me a few times. If you burn immediately after sex (like a few minutes), this might be the case for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/p09fl7/finally_cured_3_years_of_chronic_utis/,Finally Cured 3 Years of Chronic UTIs,Treatments üíä,94,25,0.99,chr0nicallychill

Background context: I get a uti after sex every time, and like many people I tried everything. Eventually a male GP put me on low dose antibiotics to take after sex. I‚Äôve been on them for 2.5 years and they had begun to give me yeast infections so obviously I wanted to move off them asap. I would get yeast infections from EVERYTHING. First step for me was healing my vaginal microbiome - I saw a naturopath who specialised in this and it took 6 months and a lot of money but it worked. I was sceptical about naturopathy but knew that western medicine encouraged more antibiotics and harsh treatments and that the vagina is such a delicate ecosystem. This was super effective and I would recommend to anyone. Unfortunately the UTIs persisted. 

I found out about the vaccine and thought this was my last hope but you have to jump through so many hoops to get it. I had seen two gynos, two GPS and a urologist trying to get access to it. They were all pretty hesitant because it‚Äôs not super common here. The urologist basically said she would let me try it if I agreed to a cystoscope (DO NOT RECOMMEND - the most painful experience of my life) and to try hiprex for 6 months. 

Like many of you, I had tried hiprex already but usually only after sex or once a day. She told me to try it consistently twice a day for 6-8 months and then have sex without the antibiotic. I was sceptical but was consistent and gave it a go. Well, I had sex 5 days ago and for the first time in 3 years I didn‚Äôt get a uti!!

I no longer have a car or job, so no way to medically deal with this so as of now I'm back to microwaved wet socks and hot baths to try to drain. It's been swelling for only a night, but after my experiences with this, I'm easy to panic and have been just BAWLING my eyes out. The swelling itself doesn't hurt but the inside of my labia, I'm assuming where the incision is, hurts when I wipe after I pee most likely due to the stretch of the skin. Will update as I go along.

~~~~~~~~~~

I have had cysts pretty frequently since I was young teens, but it's only been the past 2 years since they've started becoming so big that I legitimacy could not walk.

Around January of this year, I had to go to the E.R. and have it drained because I was bed-bound, taking ibuprofen and motrin, constant heat pad on my cooch for a solid week before I worked up the courage to do anything. I've ways had a lot of anxiety and fear over my vagina as a whole so the thought of anything wrong going on or having anything done to it was terrifying. 

I was given morphine as well as a local anesthetic. They cut me open and drained me, but they didn't use a catheter or pack it or do anything to help the process (it was an E.R. at about 2 in the morning, I doubt anyone specialized in that was present, but oh my God).

I had another big one two weeks ago. I only noticed the pain Friday night, and it was pretty big the following morning. Got through work Monday well enough but when it was time for bed, it was so bad that the thought of going to work made me absolutely sob. It was swollen so badly that I was walking like this town ain't big enough for the two of us, that I could feel the inside walls of my vagina outside between the bottom of my labia, almost prolapsed looking. My clitoral hood was so swollen that every bump in the road on the way to my OBGYN made it bounce so painfully. Walking any sort of distance, standing at all, sitting up, made me huff and puff just out of how much pain I was in. Gyno took one look at me and physically had to turn away for a second. Needless to say, she scheduled me for a surgery for a marsupialization the next morning.

The whole process only took about 3 hours, 2 of those spend having a fat nap in general anesthesia recovery. She told me she was going to be generous with the size of the incision, pat me on my knee and told me I was a poor baby (my OBGYN actually delivered me, so I like to think she's pretty sympathetic to me but she truly cares about all her patients). I was immediately was able to stand, though pretty woozy from general anesthesia as well as the local one they used. I was able to go home and sleep well for the first time that night.

I had to go back to work the day after surgery because I couldn't afford to take off, but I was sent home with gauze, a massive pad, one of the post-partum spray bottles, these super comfy cotton boxers, a painkiller, and an antibiotic. The swelling was about 3/4 of the way down already and was gone completely after a few days. The only pain I ever felt after was just getting out of the car and stretching my leg out too far. But cue more panic about the mental crisis of having a vagina instead add the horror of having stitches on top of an extra hole now. I still haven't touched it or even looked at it to see if the stitches were gone yet.

But I had my follow up yesterday; she said I was healing beautifully and that hopefully this would solve my issue for good. This has been the most awful experience of my life.

I stopped probiotics 1 month ago and I'm still burning whenever I attempt to insert something.

There are times when users' requests are invalid and have to be rejected, which I do by providing arguments why it can't go through, this sometimes leads to long threads and me laying out the facts only to suddenly get hit with something along the lines of: ""You could have said it in a nicer way!"" or ""This communication style is polarizing"", and there I'm left confused as to WTF have I written that offended this person!

bmzvzq,Healthyhooha,1557503186.0,"I made a throwaway account specifically to write this post. This past October, I started having an issue with recurring UTIs. I would only get them immediately after having sex with my boyfriend. Within a day or two of having sex, I'd have the characteristic burning while peeing and strange odor in my urine. I went to my OBGYN, got a urine test for STIs and UTI, and got diagnosed with E. Coli in my urethra, the common culprit for UTIs. All STI tests came back negative. Prescribed antibiotics, did the job. 

Same thing happened to me every month after that, whenever I'd visit my boyfriend. I'd have sex and get a UTI, get tested for STIs (always a negative result), take antibiotics, repeat. I was so frustrated and felt really self-conscious about it. It got to a point where I was afraid to have sex because I knew a UTI would follow. We tried different positions to reduce the likelihood of transferring bacteria from back to front, but that rarely worked. My boyfriend was really understanding and supportive; he took me to urgent care and sat out in the waiting room while I saw a doctor. We decided what the best course of action would be from there. 

I switched my OBGYN in February after getting two UTIs in one month and told her what was going on. She seemed to take my concerns a lot more seriously, so she ordered a pap smear and a blood test for a full STI panel. It turns out that I had a ureaplasma infection and BV. She explained that these weren't STIs but ureaplasma could be passed through intercourse. She prescribed me metrogel and doxycycline and sent me on my way. After that, I never had another issue with UTIs. 

To anyone suffering from recurrent UTIs, especially after sex, find a doctor who will take your concerns seriously. Bacterial vaginal infections can increase the likelihood of getting a UTI, and the issue won't stop until the bacterial infection is addressed. I went through 5 courses of different antibiotics (which came with their own issues) and repeated the same process over and over until I found a doctor who took me seriously. If you think your doctor is brushing you off, find a new one. Ask to be tested for ureaplasma and other infections, even if it seems unlikely. Don't keep dealing with the same problem; if you feel like something is off, you're probably right. If I didn't switch my OBGYN, I'd probably still be having this issue.

b6efls,WomensHealth,1553747562.0,"Thanks to a contraception malfunction, I unhappily found out I was pregnant with my 3rd child. On Saturday the 16th I took a pregnancy test and it came back positive. Took another one Sunday morning to make sure and it was definitely positive. Made an appointment with the first dr I could get in to see at my regular medical center (my usual dr was on holiday) and managed to get an appointment for Tuesday morning. She didn‚Äôt do a pee test again as the store bought tests are the same as the ones at the medical centre and it‚Äôs unusual to get a false positive. I immediately told her I wanted to be referred for a dating scan and a termination. She gave me a referral for the ultrasound (I had to ring and book), a form for blood tests and a form/swabs for swabs (sti check etc). Very quick (15-20 minutes), easy and professional.   


I went to work, and went back to the drs after work for the blood tests and to hand in the swabs (self swabbed).   


I rang the ultrasound clinic and got an appointment for Wednesday afternoon. Went in, was there for maybe 15 minutes again, got a date- 6w1d. I can‚Äôt remember if it was Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning but I get a phone call from the clinic, a very nice lady called Mary making an appointment for me to see the dr for the pre-termination appt on Thursday afternoon, and tentatively booking me in for the termination itself the following Thursday (28th), to be confirmed once I‚Äôd had my dating scan.    


Thursday afternoon I went and and met with Mary and then the dr, both women were very polite and professional and put me at ease. I met with the dr for maybe half an hour. I had to explain why I wanted the termination, what plans we were making so it hopefully wouldn‚Äôt happen again, offered me free counselling sessions if I needed them, gave me advice about contraception, was generally really positive and helpful. As soon as I found out I was pregnant I made a list of pros and cons for the situation and it was clear from the outset that another child would be detrimental to my physical and mental health. So she was really pleased that I had actually given it some thought.    


On the day of termination I had to be at the hospital at 8am, having fasted since the night before, with warm socks, and with a driver. I was shown to my room to wait, and then met with the second dr who basically asks if I‚Äôm sure about this and if I have any questions. There I was given a variety of drugs to relax me and my cervix, antibiotics, pain relief, and left alone in my room with my husband for an hour to let them work. They made me a little loopy, and the cramps start almost immediately. They bring you a hot water bottle to help with that. Then after an hour or so they wheel you down to the operating room, by this stage you‚Äôre lucid but wobbly. They wack some monitoring stuff on you, and inject you with the sedative. That‚Äôs the last thing i remember, like I blink and I‚Äôm being wheeled back into my room to recover and given an hour or so to rest and recover, a cup of tea and some bicuits, given some more antibiotics and some anti nausea stuff, and sent home with my husband. I threw up twice, and then slept for 4 hours. I‚Äôll have a period now, which will be a bit more crampy than normal. If I need to I can head back to drs free of charge for check ups (which they recommend).   


Time will tell if there are any complications, like any procedure. But they do what they can (pre-loading antibiotics) to combat this. I didn‚Äôt take them up on the offer of counselling because I was very sure I did not want any more kids, but I did have a couple of close friends (as well as my husband of course) for moral support. I don‚Äôt pretend that it‚Äôs an easy choice regardless of how sure I was, because a part of me feels that as a happily married woman I should be happy to have more children. And what‚Äôs one more you know? But one more is actually a huge change. Too much of a change for me. So I‚Äôm not.. totally unfazed by it.. but I have people helping me and letting me vent. My husband is booked in for a vasectomy, which will cost around $400 but is worth the price. All in all the cost to me was 2 days off work, for which I claimed sick leave, and a couple of work time appointments, the time for which I just made up at the end of my days.

But this feeling is only about cervix and deeper. My vulva, and actual vaginal canal dont bother me. The second I start thinking about my cervix, and uterus, and how periods work and how everything down there functions, I start feeling incredibly ill. Like the start of a panic attack. If I don‚Äôt block out the mental image and thoughts quickly enough it will spiral into a panic attack. I don‚Äôt get periods anymore because I skip the sugar pills on my birth control (upon talking w my gp ofc).

The image of a blood vessel ‚Äúpopping‚Äù between your skin because of pressure absolutely makes me blood run cold it‚Äôs so freaky. When I get sick or have injuries, it‚Äôs the grossness, and just the body horror of it all more than the pain or physical discomfort. I know I‚Äôve always been psychologically sensitive to injuries, I freak myself out more than it hurts- but with my reproductive system, I don‚Äôt really understand why I feel so distressed when I think about them simply existing. 

It‚Äôs honestly distressing. I feel like I have to block out parts of my body or else I start feeling violently ill. I remember I had to sit out of health class in middle school because I started feeling nauseous. 

I didn‚Äôt grow up particularly sex-negative, and it‚Äôs not like a purity thing, it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ body horror. During sex, it‚Äôs not like I can actually feel my partners penis hit my cervix, (or I mean, it doesn‚Äôt hurt or anything so I don‚Äôt think about it) but once he mentioned he was so deep he was hitting my cervix, thinking it was sexy, and I became violently ill. It‚Äôs so strange and weird. It‚Äôs the same thinking about pregnancy and birth. It‚Äôs so horrifying. I know a lot of people think it‚Äôs scary, but to this extent? Fainting, vomiting, wanting to crawl out of my skin.

My question is am I alone? I‚Äôm sorry if this is completely unorganized, I genuinely cannot make myself go back and edit this because it freaks me out to think about and I already drove myself into anxiety writing this. Does anyone else have visceral, disgust and fear response to your own body?

LEEP was performed under general anesthesia at the beginning of May. Three portions of my cervix were taken and an endocervical curretage was done. It took almost 2 weeks for the pathology results to come back. My gynecologist called within minutes of the pathology report being sent. He told me that a portion of my cervix that was removed during the LEEP was positive for cancer, and referred me to a local gynecological oncologist at a nearby hospital cancer center.

Upon reviewing my pathology report, I found that the official diagnosis is high grade small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Naturally, I immediately Googled this result, as I had never heard of this type of cancer. Apparently, it is a very rare and very aggressive type of cancer with a relatively poor prognosis. To say that I am terrified right now would be an understatement.

I received the diagnosis 3 days ago and my mind is still reeling and my emotions and thoughts about the situation are all over the place. I see the oncologist on Wednesday, and I am so anxious. With this being such a rare form of cancer, I will likely be seeking a second opinion about my diagnosis and prognosis.

I'd love to hear experiences from women that have a similar diagnosis. If you're willing to share what hospital you were treated at, that would be super helpful as well. With this being so rare, I imagine there are only a few hospitals that have any experience in treating this disease. I'm willing to do anything necessary to receive the best treatment possible.

A dude here asking for advice regarding how to approach a situation which seems like a loss-loss to me. 

I have a girlfriend right now who simply gets very unpleasantly aromatic during sexual encounters and it's turning me off more and more. Very clean and tidy person, just doesn't smell right only then.

Now, a healthy relationship would have a discussion about it but I've already been stung once with another girlfriend I had a few years ago who also had a similar problem but much much worse to a level that sometimes grossed her out as well but when I did bring attention to it, she said that ""No woman wants to hear how their boyfriend tells them that they're smelly"" which she said after the relationship that it harmed her mentally quite a lot.

What's the best way to approach this with the least odds of getting burned? Or ideas which I could implement?

I know we are all rightfully pissed about the absolutely devastating SCOTUS decision that came down on Friday. Now we have had a few days to process and it's time to get to work. One of the most important things we can do at this point is get involved in the legislative process to codify abortion rights. The Women's Health Protection Act aims just to do that. It has yet to pass, but will be up for vote again soon . The Center for Reproductive Rights has made it RIDICULOUSLY EASY for you to contact your representatives and let them know you need them to support this very important piece of legislation. 

Here is a link with info on the act: 
https://reproductiverights.org/the-womens-health-protection-act-federal-legislation-to-protect-the-right-to-access-abortion-care/

And here is the link where they help you to contact your reps , simply add your name and address and they will use that to find your reps and how they have previously voted to pre populate and send a beautifully worded email appropriate to their previous vote. It's so simple and takes VERY LITTLE TIME, but it can make a HUGE DIFFERENCE. Your reps need to hear from you. They need to know that this will affect them come voting season , and they need to know how their constituents feel!

Please take action to support this key legislation, ease get the word out, spread it all over your social medias. The more people who contact their reps, the better chance we have of getting this passed.

lkzfpj,TwoXSupport,1613463705.0,"Hello everyone,

I still peruse TwoXChromosome frequently and noticed a upswing in posters being attacked in their DMs. One woman went as far as delete her Reddit account after threats of Doxxing. As such, I wanted to mention 2 tools that may be useful for those interested in them.   


1) Disallowing DMs.

 On PC, click your profile on the top right of your screen and go into user settings. The last option on the right is Chat and Messaging. Set those to Nobody or the 30 day option to avoid messages from people who make throwaways to attack people.

On Mobile ( I have a Samsung, if this isn't how it works on iPhone, my DMs are in fact open) . Click your avatar on the top left while not viewing a sub, press settings which is at the bottom and click ""Account Settings for u/Biddy0711 except.. it'll be your name not mine. I don't see an option on mobile to have ""Older than 30 days"" allowed to DM so it's just on/off.

2) Preventing your posts from making it to r/all. We're a small sub so I don't see our posts making it to the big stage like hey can in TxC like one of mine did back in September and I got slammed with hatred. That said, maybe people want to know how anyways. So... 

PC... click your profile on the top right of your screen and go into settings. Go into Account and then Profile, scroll down to the bottom and turn off ""Content Visibility""

Mobile (Again... Samsung.. plz don't eat me iPhone users if it's different). Click your profile on the top left while not in a sub and choose ""My Profile"" then ""Edit"" and turn off ""Content Visibility""

And voila, you can now post without being so popular you get sent to /all and become unpopular, or.... more popular. But with your DMs closed... WHO CARES :) Under ""Content Visibility"" for both PC and Mobile is ""Show active communities"" if you don't want people snooping your profiles activity too much.

gprrw1,Healthyhooha,1590334844.0,"Hi everyone. So I wanted to post this because I‚Äôve been dealing with BV on and off for over 2 years. I‚Äôve done so much research after feeling so hopeless and depressed as a result of it and I‚Äôve learned a lot about my body. I‚Äôve had gynecologists fail to explain to me what was wrong, make me feel abnormal, and leave me confused. By the way I‚Äôm pretty young, so it‚Äôs kinda sad to me that I need to know all this but at least it can help in the future. I‚Äôve made a lot of lifestyle changes that have been seeming to help and I hope they can help others too. (Sorry for potential bad formatting)

- I take a daily probiotic. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all heard this one before but in addition to everything else I‚Äôve been doing, it‚Äôs kept me healthy. However, probiotics alone DID NOT do anything, so it can be misleading. I use RenewLife Ultimate Flora.

- I switched to the highest percentage of cotton underwear possible. Aerie has cute underwear in different styles that are 90% cotton and above. They‚Äôre comfy and breathable. I‚Äôve also eliminated thongs too unless they‚Äôre cotton. 

- I switched my laundry detergent. I have no idea if this is what was causing my issues, but just to be safe I now use Free and Clear detergent. I‚Äôve noticed less itchiness since I‚Äôve been using it. (I also use dove unscented soap in the shower) 

- I used boric acid suppositories. This is a common one too, but at one point this was the last thing I haven‚Äôt tried. I inserted one every night for two weeks. I didn‚Äôt start to show results for about 5 days so that‚Äôs why I prolonged it. Now I use one once a week (or after sexual activity) as a preventative measure. 

- I limited carbs and sugar. I know for some people it‚Äôs hard to eliminate as many carbs as they want to. For me, the sugar aspect was more important. Once I started this, I realized how many things have more sugar than I expected, and that definitely could‚Äôve been the reason I always had BV. 

- I take daily vitamin d. I recently found out that vitamin d deficiency can cause recurrent BV. I was taking it anyway before I even found that out, but at least it‚Äôs extra benefits! 

- I drink A LOT of water. A little more than half my body weight, and I‚Äôve even noticed some bloating going away. 

- Other small things is that I increased my protein intake, occasionally drink kombucha, eat more fruit and drink green tea a lot. I also never sleep with underwear on and I let myself completely dry after the shower before putting underwear on. 

I‚Äôm sorry if all of these things are cliche, I just wanted to post this incase some people didn‚Äôt know.

gjdll1,WomensHealth,1589423728.0,"I lost my virginity late in life. Nevertheless I‚Äôd started going for pap spears around age 20. I often was on BC pills for acne and difficult periods. Because I was embarrassed about being an older virgin, I usually lied and listed 1 sexual partner for my sexual history.

Some years ago when I still had virgin status I went to a new doctor and decided to be honest. I was about 30 and listed 0 for sexual partners. The doctor was a woman. She said to me in a mocking tone, ‚ÄúWell why are you even here?‚Äù  Embarrassed, I told her I thought every adult woman was supposed to get pap spears, plus I wanted a BC prescription. She told me it‚Äôs not necessary for a woman who has never been sexually active to get a pap spear, or maybe every 10 years is enough. Then to make it worse, she made a big production of getting what she referred to as a ‚Äúbaby speculum‚Äù. Yes she used the word ‚Äúbaby‚Äù. I was totally humiliated. 

The thing is... I‚Äôm fairly certain my hymen was pretty stretched by then. I used super sized tampons with ease and had experimented with vibrators - no problem if I am relaxed and lubricated. I never have had pain or bleeding. However, I did and still do have spotting after an exam. 

Now that I am even older and no longer a virgin and list that on my history, I have still had a gynecologist mock me. Never a male doctor, always a female. I tended to prefer male doctors because they never mocked me. Now most recently I had a female doctor do the exam, which I didn‚Äôt expect - and once again she makes snide remarks. She too made a comment about ‚ÄúI better get the little speculum‚Äù after doing the pelvic exam with fingers. Her tone was rude. Then she acted suspicious of my sexual activity, and also asked me how physically active I am, which struck me as odd (I‚Äôm not overweight FYI). WHY? 

Why are these women doctors making comments about my vagina ‚Äúsize‚Äù? At first I thought the other doctor was just a jerk and mocking my virginity. Now that I‚Äôm not a virgin, there is still some bizarre snideness over my vagina ‚Äúsize‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt even think the vagina was a static size, but apparently in an exam, I require a small speculum. Is that so incredibly bizarre for an adult woman? Because they sure make me feel that way.... I never suspected this would happen AFTER I actually had sex.

I needed the antibiotics as I was starting to pee blood. I rushed to my primary care to find my regular doctor not there. Instead, I saw another nurse, which is perfectly fine. I was supposed to get my physical that day too cause it was also my annual check up. A few red flags right off the bat:

1. She told me that I shouldn‚Äôt get a physical, cause I am too young (30years old).
2. She asked about my UTI, and said I need to take a test in order to receive medication. Meanwhile I already told her my obvious symptoms. She said the lab test should only take less than a day. So I said okay, I‚Äôll just wait.
3. Second and third day came along and no results. So I called cause I was in so much pain where I couldn‚Äôt sleep, she said the lab hasn‚Äôt came back yet and she still wont prescribe the antibiotics. Then the office was closed cause of the weekend.
4. I resorted to go to urgent care cause I received no feedback from my doctor after calling twice and got snarky feedbacks from her, saying that she would only prescribe medication once the lab work is back. Urgent care costed me $300. 
5. She finally called me back on the following Tuesday (6 days later) and said my uti is positive and she prescribed medication for me. I then told her that I already went somewhere else, and she said- why didn‚Äôt you call? We would‚Äôve prescribed you medication. This is where I got furious. Cause I now have to pay for my primary care for not treating me, and she lied!
2. Now back to my physical exam - I live outside of the US so it would be good for a full physical. She ignored me, then as she was about to walk out the door, I said am I still getting my physical? She rolled her eyes, and said yeah we can give you one.

What can I do? I didn‚Äôt expect an UTI diagnosis can be that high at an urgent care. Can I call my insurance company to start a claim?

oru6ml,Healthyhooha,1627286248.0,"Hello vagina friends! Warning: LONG post ahead! Worth the read if you've been struggling with consistent and chronic vaginal infections or pain.

Whew. I have wanted to write this post ever since I first became a member of this sub. I've been on a long journey with my vagina, and I am IMMENSELY PLEASED to report I now have discovered a cure/treatment that is working for me. It's a long story, so please, bear with me.

A little background:

I never had many sexual health issues prior to 2020. I had one UTI when I was 13 (I am 22 now), and I had one yeast infection in 2019 aged 20, easily treated with diflucan. In summer 2019, I experienced an odd burning and itching on two occasions a couple months apart, lasting for 4-5 days each time. During that time, I sought the help of docs, and I tested negative for everything they checked for (all STIs, yeast, BV). I treated the itching and burning with topical hydrocortisone, and I thought nothing more of it because the symptoms resolved quickly. The symptoms at that time were not exacerbated by sexual activity, I was sore during sex, but sex did not make the symptoms worse. 

Fast forward to November 2020:

I was experiencing burning and itching in November. I ignored it for a few days, applying some hydrocortisone as I had done before. After awhile, I finally noticed a cottage cheese discharge, and I was again treated for a yeast infection with diflucan. At this time, I went to the gynecologist, and I tested positive for Group B Strep, which was NOT treated with antibiotics. My symptoms improved on their own, and I had no issues in December. (Side note: I had extremely irregular periods in 2019/2020 due to anorexia and often skipped multiple months in a row, but I have had my periods back for the entirety of 2021). 

From January-May, about a week before my period, I again experienced the same burning and itching that I recalled feeling in summer 2019. There was ZERO discharge associated with these symptoms, and the symptoms resolved by my period, then cropped up again the next month. Sometimes, when I put a finger inside, a few dry chunks of my inner vaginal skin would come out on my finger. I experienced some urinary symptoms, mostly the feeling of not being able to completely void my bladder.

I saw a dermatologist in early 2021, and he diagnosed me with vestibular papillomatosis. At that time, I thought the VP was what was causing the issues, and I explored options with the derm to treat it. I was given tacrolimus ointment, which caused the most horrific burning and itching on my vulva that I have ever experienced, it was even worse than the time I tried Monistat. The after effects of that ointment lasted for a week and a half. During that time, I again sought treatment, this time from my PCP. She did another full panel to test for everything, and I was negative again. I was using only aquaphor on my vulva to soothe it after the tacrolimus, and the aquaphor seemed to exacerbate itching (I think I may be sensitive to lanolin). I discontinued the aquaphor. 

I continued to have symptoms prior to each period, and Jan-April, I took diflucan each time, thinking I needed to treat a yeast infection. The symptoms resolved each time, lasting no more than a week. However, from March-May, my vaginal opening and inner labia became increasingly more irritated from the cyclical symptoms, and I began to have pain during sex constantly, even when I wasn't actively itchy. My vagina was always burning, the inner labia were super red and irritated, my VP was raised and palpable from all the irritation. 

I grew hopeless around this time. I spoke with my derm about getting the VP lasered off, and he referred me to a doctor who never even tried to call to schedule. I was very depressed about the state of my vagina, and I even considered breaking things off with the man I've been seeing since January because sex was so painful I was beginning to dread it. He tried to be understanding, but it was very frustrating for both of us. He didn't want to hurt me, and I wanted to be able to have sex without pain. I am only 22 years old, and I began to think I'd never have sex without pain again. I have a very high libido, and the idea that this was going to be my new normal (again, I thought it was the VP causing the issue) really brought me down emotionally. 

I think it was around March that I discovered this subreddit. I'd done a lot of googling about the VP and Group B Strep diagnosis I had received, and that is how I found this place. I did a ton of reading on many, many old threads, and I'd like to thank anyone who has posted here about their journeys, because it helped me feel less alone and helped me find a solution. 

In April, I developed 2 medium sized Bartholin gland cysts. I tried the sitz baths and they didn't seem to help at all. One cyst eventually burst during sex, relatively painlessly, and drained on its own. The other cyst, on the right side, remains to this day, but it has drastically shrunk down. My gyno has evaluated it, and the cyst causes me no issues at this time. 

In May, per the advice of this sub, I finally decided to try some remedies. A few days into a flare during PMS, I took a bath with a ton of baking soda mixed in, and afterwards, I popped in a boric acid suppository.

Y'all. The relief during the baking soda bath was damn near instant. My vulva was so soothed. The irritation inside remained, but over the next couple days, it went away with the treatment with boric acid and soda baths. In June, the second I felt a tiny bit of irritation, I again popped in boric acid, and I didn't develop a flare. Starting in June, I was able to have sex normally again WITHOUT ANY PAIN. It was like a miracle, and my partner commented in wonder about how much better the sex was. I didn't have to tap out due to the pain after 5 minutes, and I was able to get wet again like normal. 

Now it is July. A week ago, I went back to the gyno as I was first experiencing some flare symptoms. I got tested for yeast, BV, and Group B strep yet again. My culture came back NEGATIVE for the strep this time, indicating my body has cleared that infection by now. It also came back negative for yeast or BV. However, my culture did come back with a note about the sample ""exhibiting *many* epithelial cells."" Per my research, this is a common finding in women who have cytolytic vaginosis, and since I don't have any other infections (I was NOT ever tested for myco/ureaplasma, to be fair, but I've been tested for everything else), I have now come to the conclusion that I have cytolytic vaginosis.

Cytolytic vaginosis is an overgrowth of lactobacilli in the vagina. Lacto is a normal part of vaginal flora, but when it overgrows, it produces so much lactic acid that the vaginal pH drops too low (yes, vaginas should be acidic, but no, more acidity is NOT always better). CV generally exhibits a pH of 3-4.5. I tested my vaginal pH, and it is in this range. This month of July, I have just used the baking soda baths, and inserted some baking soda into my vagina, and I have not had a flare. No pain. No burning or itching. Baking soda raises the vaginal pH, relieving the symptoms of CV. Boric acid, with a pH of 5, does the same thing. My vaginal pH is higher when tested after using the boric or the baking soda. CV causes cyclical symptoms because lacto increases during the luteal phase of one's cycle, and then the basic pH of period blood relieves symptoms.

I cannot believe the solution is this simple, and to be honest, I am angry about the days I spent hopeless, suicidal, and in despair over an issue that could've been resolved had my gyno taken the time to test for EVERYTHING. To test for CV definitively, you must count the lacto on the plate. A culture including only yeast, BV, and strep B is woefully inadequate, and I am so sad for my fellow vagina friends who are suffering needlessly right now. 

The vagina is a delicate balance between bacterias and yeast competing for resources. Strep can overtake lacto, and having too few lacto can cause BV or allow the Strep to run rampant. However, overtreating yeast with diflucan over and over (when I didn't even have a yeast infection), is what I believe caused my overgrowth of lacto and subsequently CV. I would say I am about 97% certain I have CV, despite not having had a count done. The many epithelial cells, my symptoms, the cyclical pattern, and the empirical evidence from the treatments yielding me total and complete relief provides the evidence I need to feel satisfied that CV is my issue. 

To recap:

I had vaginal yeast in early November which responded to diflucan.

I had an overgrowth of lactobacilli due to overtreatment with diflucan which threw my flora out of balance. I now suspect this is also what happened after my very first yeast infection in summer 2019, which was also treated with diflucan. 

The overgrowth lowered my pH to the point that my vagina was constantly burning, itching, skin was sloughing off internally, and I could not have sex without pain. This also irritated my VP. I had group B strep which resolved after being overtaken by lactobacilli. 

I also had 2 Bartholin cysts, one of which resolved and the other which has shrunk and causes me no issues. 

My VP causes me no issues at this time, however, there are treatment options available for women whose VP causes symptoms. 

Phew. Long story short, baking soda was my miracle solution. Boric acid can also raise pH, but it disrupts normal flora, so use with caution if you don't currently have an infection like yeast or BV. CV doesn't need boric acid to be treated, just the baking soda. Some women use baking soda suppositories or douches, but just putting some inside me with a finger and doing soda baths has been sufficient for me. 

I feel like a new woman again. I enjoy sex again. I am no longer constantly anxious and in severe discomfort and pain, with swollen and red inner labia that chafed all the time and burned and itched. I have ZERO symptoms. I am totally restored to normal and have been for 2.5 months now.

*As u/Loren_Drinks_Coffee suggested below, ""...to anyone who is worried about an upcoming test or waiting on test results, follow the link to the original post. Have a look through all the comments.""*

Hello beautiful souls. 

I wanted to give an update on my little journey, as it might(?) be helpful for anyone experiencing anything similar. 

I had a ""ropey feeling"" breast lump of concern, found ~one year ago, right at the edge of my nipple. I put off having it looked into, thinking it was period-related (only 26! Pff!). In August 2020 I went to my family doctor for an unrelated pre-op assessment (permanent sterilization, a bilateral salpingectomy). I mentioned the lump offhand at the end of the appointment. She did not look up from her papers. *She did not feel or examine the lump.* She told me that it was likely related to my menstrual cycle, and told me to come back later (???) if it was still there. No time frame given. And I left!!!!! 

I cannot stress enough... **push for your doctor to feel your breast. She should have requested an ultrasound immediately.**

In December 2020 I let my doctor know that it was üëê still there üëê and she.... ü•Åü•Åü•Å.... requested an ultrasound. 

The ultrasound led to multiple mammograms, then multiple biopsies.  My surgeon let me know that I had DCIS (ductal carcinomas in situ, or a contained pre-cancer). DCIS is when the cells have not moved beyond the duct. I had 4 lymph nodes surgically removed, and they came back clear; nothing had spread to anywhere else thankfully! 

On March 30th, I had a double mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. It was a 3 hour procedure. After waking up in recovery, I was discharged same-day to recover at home. This initially was a scary thought, but I can see now how it promotes faster healing. I was given T3's, but ended up using Ibuprofen 400mg 2-3x per day. Only the first two days had pain registering no more than 6 out of 10. Then it was a few days of intense itch, and now it's really nothing. 
I was sent home with Jackson-Pratt drains, which stayed in for one week - dumping the liquid and recording amounts - before being removed. They were by far the worst part simply due to being annoying.

Opening my compression top to take my first shower after drain removal, was the most emotional part of this journey. I didn't remember that the breasts had to ""drop and settle"" into a natural shape. They were like two extremely swollen, hard, bruised, grotesque looking rocks in my chest. I entered a state of shock. But after self-talk and seeing improvements to the bruising each day, and understanding the end result will only appear after 3 months or more, I'm in a good mental space. 

My followup appointment with the surgeon has resulted in them now knowing that I actually did have breast cancer cells present. They're fully removed, and the next steps will be meeting with the cancer agency to discuss hormone blockers. 

Please, ladies, push for your healthcare. Needless to say I've changed family doctors.

I just started tracking my period in July. Never felt the need to before because given my (lack of) sexual history, I just thought it was a nuisance and a reminder by Mother Nature that I‚Äôm single af. Like I was seriously oblivious, whenever my doctor asked, I had no idea when the last one was and when the next one was coming. So I couldn‚Äôt even tell you if this has happened before.

My period has been pretty regular since July, according to Flo, but now I‚Äôm a week late and I‚Äôm wondering if I should be worried?

Some friends told me that it could be due to stress. I did start a new job recently and I‚Äôve been having car trouble but I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm any more stressed than I‚Äôve ever been before. At least not enough for my body to be mutinous.

The last year I‚Äôve been having trouble with tampons being basically rejected by my body.  I can insert one with no problem or pain, I know to insert the applicator until my ‚Äúfingers touch my body‚Äù and all that, like I said, I‚Äôve been using rh for 30 year, right?  So when I stand up the tampon starts to squeeze out and is instantly and horribly uncomfortable.  It‚Äôs like I have a weird vacuum effect happening like when you try to depress a syringe with your finger over the opening- you can press it down but the minute you let go it slides back up.  So annoying.

I suspect I may have a uterine prolapse.  I brought it up to my OB at my last visit but she couldn‚Äôt feel it, which makes sense as you can only see/feel it when I‚Äôm standing up.  So it must not be severe.  I started having trouble with it after my first baby which was vaginal with forceps.  But I‚Äôve used tampons since then with no issues, although I suppose it could be getting worse.

I had the same experience when I tried a cup.  It popped back out the minute I let it go.

dpn1zh,Healthyhooha,1572526144.0,"I'm currently dealing with my own sexuality in a way that I can't perform it correctly.
I'm 17. This is very embarassing for me because I feel really alone in the world and even the most exhaustive google search hasn't led me to someone with something NEARLY similar to me. And it's ruining my mental health day to day.

From what I can recall, when I was a child, I never ever explored my own vagina. Never touched, masturbated, felt anything good down there. I never had curiosity to see, and the times I did I got REALLY scared.
My mother never taught me how to take care of my own vulva, not even how to clean it. The lack of knowledge maybe could have been solved on my own by just touching and playing  down there, BUT I never did.
So I never cleaned properly (in between the folds, under the clitoral hood, etc). In fact, I've been scared to even touch my labia minora for more tan 16 years. Yes, I know, that sounds disgusting.

I got myself a girlfriend and when sex started to be a thing in my mind, I realized I never had any contact with my own vulva. And I realized that that shit was dirty.
Every day in the shower I would battle because I was scared to even separate the lips and clean. Even touching felt so sensitive and I was disgusted.
Took me like two entire weeks to be able to clean it. And when I did... I realized how terrible it was. I took weird grey clumps that were literally sticking in my labia, god knows how long. The incredible thing is that this has never caused me problems. (I guess the bidet was useful because It cleaned something without touching).

I had sex. I discovered I am dry as a desert. I literally covered it with scissoring and making my own vulva wet with hers. 
Now I'm not afraid of touching but I can't feel pleasure, If I touch it feels good a while but then it's just bad. Hurts, I don't get wet, not even a little. Not even when I'm turned on. It's a fucking martyr. 

I have a lot of kinks, fetishes and I can't even enjoy sex. I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm starting to think that not discovering myself when I was little is paying now with some kind of trauma. And now I'm totally blocked of sex. It's now ruining my relationship because even when I'm really interested in having sex I can't even think I can do it. I feel really frustrated. I want to get wet. I want to experience my sexuality. Has anyone ever experienced a childhood like mine?

i (f17) recently lost my virginity to my boyfriend and it was great. i had a lot of fear going into it, as i‚Äôve never been able to put more than a finger in, but, miraculously, our first time having sex was fine! a little pain, but nothing too bad. i was on my period, so i bled a lot, but that seemed normal. we both showered together before and after to wash the menstrual blood off. 

two days later, we had sex again (both times using condoms), and it only hurt for about 15 seconds, and was fine after. however, i was bleeding a little bit, outside of my period this time. 

initially, i thought it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, but it‚Äôs been 8 days and i‚Äôm still spotting. it‚Äôs tiny specks of bright red blood. i‚Äôve also noticed what i think is a hymenal tag at the front of my vagina. i‚Äôve also had awful smelling white/yellow discharge, and a TERRIBLE burning pain while peeing (as well as more frequent urination). on top of everything, i‚Äôve had headaches and a sore throat, though that may be unrelated (my mom also got sick after our holiday gatherings). 

my boyfriend got tested before we had sex and is clean of any stds/stis, and i had no symptoms before we had sex. i‚Äôm just incredibly nervous and scared and don‚Äôt know what to do. 

i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a uti, bv, some freak std, or something even worse. 

if anyone has experienced anything similar or has any tips, please please please help. i‚Äôm so fucking scared.

edit: if anyone comes across this post in need of advice, it ended up being BV and a uti. my boyfriend had a strain of bv and didn‚Äôt know. good luck out there.

14zgaty,Healthyhooha,1689340827.0,"Been having problems with BV for years‚Ä¶ omg, YEARS! I can‚Äôt even enjoy sex or have sex like I want to because of this mess. It‚Äôs so embarrassing to say the least üôÑ

Anyway, I went to my OBGYN last week and of course he prescribed me antibiotics, I took four 500mg for two days. Didn‚Äôt work. Discharge came back, smell, etc üòµ‚Äçüí´. Called back to see if they can get me something else. Then I thought about how tired I am of taking antibiotics! IM SO TIRED‚ÄºÔ∏è It‚Äôs messing up my gut health, I have to take these every month it seems! I‚Äôve been tested for everything, negative. Ureaplasma and mycoplasma- negative. 

Anyway, found a healthy alternative because I refuse to take antibiotics this time. Like no, I‚Äôm not doing it. I need to get my gut health in check and then after that I‚Äôm pretty sure the BV will go away on its own. 

So, I got an aloe Vera plant from 4 seasons. It‚Äôs a big one ü§≠. Let it soak in a bowl overnight to release the yellow toxins (it contains latex). Cut it up into small chunks, I washed the slimy stuff (some ppl say you don‚Äôt have to) but I do, and wrap it in foil that‚Äôs safe to freeze or some other wrap, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Let it freeze and pushed it up there after showering. Use the inner leaf ONLY. 

I‚Äôve been using this for 3 days so far‚Ä¶. The second day, I noticed the smell diminishing‚Ä¶ the third day, it diminished  some more. I plan on using it for a week straight to see how it goes, but so far it‚Äôs been working really well. It will slide out on its own & if you‚Äôre having any irritation down there you can rub it all down there, it won‚Äôt hurt. You can use the slime as lubricant for sex. I‚Äôve even used it my hair plenty of times as well. 

And I also got some aloe vera juice (no sugar added) from Walmart (this one has lemon juice in it and it‚Äôs in a glass bottle on the juice isle) and the other from the health food store. I drink like a shot every morning on a empty stomach. It literally has no taste except for the one that has lemon juice. So you wont be gagging while drinking it, I drink it really quick. It‚Äôs honestly not bad. It kind of tastes like water to me in a way but I let my sister try it and she says it‚Äôs nasty üòÖ. So depending on your taste buds you might have to dilute it with some juice or something lol. 

Also, when swallowing aloe vera it acts a laxative so don‚Äôt get all crazy lol. My stomach is rumbling right now üòÇ. My son was constipated the other day and I let him drink a shot, he went to use the bathroom about 15 minutes later. So I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why a lot of people say aloe vera is like a detox or gut cleanser. So yea, it definitely works. 

& mind you, don‚Äôt get the one that says WHOLE LEAF.



üå∫Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk and I hope you guys try it out and see results. If you do, pls come back and let us know if it worked for youüå∫

UPDATE: AV worked for about a week, after that it stopped üòí‚Ä¶.. but I‚Äôve been trying something else, I‚Äôve been using both of them for about 2 weeks. And it has been surprisingly working well. Like, I‚Äôm really surprised! So, one time I was at the obgyn and one of the women that was talking to me in the back told me about vh essentials (probiotics with prebiotics & cranberry) and how it keeps her lady bits in check‚Ä¶. I finally got it, I‚Äôve been taking it twice a day on an empty stomach AND I‚Äôve been consuming raw garlic- smash it with a knife, take the peel off, set a timer to 10-15 minutes so it can release the good stuff(I forget what it‚Äôs called). Sometimes I consume it with honey, it kinda makes it taste better‚Ä¶ Raw garlic has some antibacterial and anti microbial properties that helps fight off many pathogenic bacteria. I haven‚Äôt had sex in like 2 months lol‚Ä¶ but I did lastnight and there was no smell ü•π and I haven‚Äôt been on antibiotics in a while so I‚Äôm happy about that.

Shout out to Unique-Cricket4621 and her post that helped me finding the solution. (search for ""How I treated my vaginal candida glabrata""). Similar to her, I swear that once I find something that works, I would share it with other women who are suffering just like I did. So here we go:

**> BACKGROUND**

I have suffered with Candida Glabrata for 3.5 years. Contrary to the normal yeast infection symptoms (discharge, itchy), my symptom was extreme pain in my vulva, vagina, uterus, and strangely belly button. It felt like the organs were squeezed by an invisible hand all the time. This area would be swollen when I had flareups, so I would look pregnant/super bloated during these times. Glabrata affected my daily life tremendously, waking up at night with the pain, working and constantly being reminded that I was having flareup, taking ibuprofen daily to help manage the pain, spending so much $$$ and energy to get rid of this thing, and not having frequent intercourse with my partner...for 3.5 YEARS! I was extremely frustrated and hopeless, and I felt like I tried every possible treatments, some helped 80% of the symptoms but they came back after a short time, some didn't help at all. I was about to give up and just accept that this is a part of me and I will have it for the rest of my life‚Ä¶and then I hit the jackpot and felt like myself again.

**> MY HEALTH PROFILE**

* Female 33yo
* Pre-diabetic & insulin resistance (A1C 5.7-5.9), actively managing to pause the progression or reverse the condition
* PCOS (hypothyroid, taking spironolactone & progesterone)
* H-pylori infection (took 2 different antibiotic treatment course to eradicate, probably wrecked my gut in the process)
* Relatively active, lift weight 3x a week, 5-8K steps daily
* Relatively balanced diet, love fruits
* Had copper IUD (but removed b/c fearing that the IUD string kept the yeast around)
* Lab test confirmed Glabrata twice. Negative for Albican, BV, and any STDs.

**> (FAILED) TREATMENTS**

* Vitanica Yeast Arrest suppository
* Several rounds of Fluconazole
* Monista suppository & oral pill
* Boric acid pHD
* Azo Yeast Plus oral pill
* Some natural oil tincture suppository from Amazon (LOL)
* RenewLife CandiSmart 15-day yeast cleanse protocol (this helped during the 15 days‚Ä¶I re-purchased this at least 4 times to manage the symptoms) - $35
* Boric acid prescription <$100
* amphotericin b oral pill & boric acid compounded (the pharmacy specially mix it for you, total \~ $300 for both)
* Boric acid compounded with EDTA (to break the film) - $170
* Boric acid compounded with TERB 1% & EDTA 0.5% - $170
* 3-month gut reset CBO protocol from EquiLife - $250 ish

**> WHAT I‚ÄôVE LEARNED:**

* Glabrata is an extremely resistant strain to treatment, and doctors don‚Äôt really know how to help you. What works for Candida Albican will most likely have no effect on Glabrata.
* Unlike H pylori which can be eradicated, Candida does not need to/or can be completely wipe out from your microbiome. From my personal research, Candida needs to be in balance with your good bacteria.
* Boric acid suppository kills both candida and good bacteria. According to my naturopathic doctor, it is fine to use boric acid long term (6+ months), but realistically, how would that impact my vaginal microbiome?! It‚Äôs a fine line that we‚Äôre dealing with.
* Candida has a protective film. Some treatments target to biofilm, to remove it first, and then attack the candida‚Ä¶interesting.
* Your gut and your vaginal microbiome are not separated. If you have gut inflammation, your vaginal system might be at risk AND vice versa. I found that my symptoms get better when I orally took RenewLife CandiSmart, with all herbal anti fungal. But it didn‚Äôt ‚Äòcure‚Äô me of Glabrata. However, I know that I needed to spiff up my gut microbiome as I continued looking for a solution for Glabrata.
* Treatment for H pylori is intense (it pushed me straight to depression) and it wiped your ecosystem of all of the good guys. Some doctors said that this is the ideal time for bad guys aka Candida to take over.
* Doctors will advise you to cut out sugar since Candida uses sugar as fuel‚Ä¶but so does every other micro/living-organisms.
* I did not try the candida diet, but I did skimmed the book. My nutritionist advised me not to‚Ä¶It looked very restrictive for me. And I LOVE FRUITS‚Ä¶so it was a hard pass.
* A massager (or a vibrator) helped me managing my symptoms‚Ä¶numbing the pain. I put it on my vulva, my lower abdominal, and belly button. It might help you :)

**> WHAT WORKED FOR ME**

Before we get to the solution, I wanted to emphasize that NOTHING WORKED FOR ME. THINGS THAT WORK FOR 80-90% OF OTHER PEOPLE DID NOT WORK FOR ME‚Ä¶BESIDES ‚Äî>

The ONLY thing that worked for me is **Fem-Dophilus¬Æ - 5 Billion CFU Vaginal & Urinary Tract probiotic**, used as vaginal suppository, 3 capsules a day before bed. Originally, I had bought the lower dose at 1 Billion x 1 capture a day, and this did nothing for me. So I gave up and moved on to other treatments. But once again, I ran out of options, and came back to this probiotic. I bought the 5 Billion CFU version (the one that needs to be refrigerated), and I up the dosage to 3 capsules, so 5 Billion x 3 capture a day = 15B CFU a day. I thought my vaginal microbiome was severely damaged and depleted of the good bacteria after antibiotic, boric acid for 1.5-2 years, etc., I needed more help and more of the good bacteria. (So you can play with the dosage if this doesn‚Äôt work for you‚Ä¶give it a chance!)

The first day, I still had symptoms so I took ibuprofen to manage the pain. After the 2nd day, the symptoms were completely gone. I felt unreal‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember how it is like without the constant uterus and vaginal pain. I continued to use 3 capsules, and continue to be symptoms-free. I even feel less inflamed and lost some weight. From research, it shows that chronic inflammation (my 3 yrs yeast infection) could negatively impact the liver, worsen insulin resistance, increase blood sugar, and cause weight gain. I hope that the treatment will continue to work, let my body heal, and then I can see more positive changes to my health.

**> CLOSING NOTE**

Hang in there if you‚Äôre going through this nightmare. It can be a very isolating experience, and even your partner can have difficulty understanding what you‚Äôre feeling. Try the different treatments, but trust your instinct. Learn about the microbiome as a whole. I believe that a bandage treatment (aka anti fungal, trying to eradicate Glabrata) will not work for Glabrata, but a holistic approach might (improve gut microbiome, increase good bacteria population in the vagina).

i first started having urinary and sexual health problems a year ago, when i got my first UTI. i think i‚Äôve had 5-6 this year, triggered by sex and usually manageable with antibiotics.

I started the combo pill about two months ago, and my health has been nightmarish since then. i was hoping to mitigate some severe PMS symptoms, but i seem to have traded one misery for another. i got a UTI when i started the pill, and have faced lingering symptoms since then. i‚Äôm lucky to have health insurance, and my doctor was recommended bc she sees a lot of patients for sexual/reproductive care. even so, i don‚Äôt feel like i‚Äôve gotten the quality of care i need from her. she‚Äôs hesitant to send me to a specialist, and treated me for a yeast infection and BV that were brought on by my birth control. even after i finished those antibiotics, something is still wrong. i have random burning pain that leaves me resting on the couch for an hour.

i‚Äôm a young person, and in a new relationship. my partner has been sweet and supportive of my need to be abstinent right now, but it‚Äôs been over a month since we‚Äôve had sex, and i miss connecting with him in that way. i‚Äôm in my last semester of college, end i worry that if my symptoms continue, i‚Äôll struggle to keep up with my academic responsibilities.

[**NoPissyBiscuits**](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoPissyBiscuits/) has made some excellent points in her/his reply to my post.  I am NOT advising against having markers placed.  I just wanted to share my experience so that others would have the benefit of hearing of one persons negative experience after having them inserted.  

\----------

&#x200B;

Almost a year ago I had a suspicious mammogram and was sent for a biopsy.  At that time, my breasts were healthy, felt and looked fine and I had NO breast issues.

Three ""markers"" were inserted in my breast for ""convenience"" if I ever had another mammogram or biopsy so future doctors and technicians could note the areas of concern.  I was told about the pain and swelling after the biopsy and that the markers were tiny, not detectable with a metal detector and that I would never know they were there.

Well, that last part was not true.  Every day  since the biopsy I have daily and sometimes hours long pain in my breast.  It aches and burns as I sit here typing.  It is almost impossible to find  comfortable position to sleep.  I find myself holding/pressing against my breast many times a day for comfort.  I mean, damn it HURTS.

I've notified the doctor and hospital.  Filed a complaint with the grievance committee and have been going back and forth with them at least a dozen times.  They say I signed the release form and there is nothing they can do.  Their recommendation is for me on my own time and dime to find a surgeon to remove them.

I cannot tell you how much this has impacted my day to day life, let along my physical relationship with my husband.

I do believe this is a rare side effect, but I just wanted to let you know you do not have to have the markers placed and I wish I never had.

I did give the cup a try for a few hours. It was very unpleasant, but I think I will blame it on the cup being the wrong size. It was tough to insert, I really had to push it in and felt a little on the outside. My cramps increased for sure. I couldn't really feel the cup, but psychologically I couldn't stop thinking there is something inside me lol. I guess that's something you just get used to over time. But the removal was the worst part. It just wouldn't come out by pulling on the stem. After many tries, I had to squat, put my index and thumb all the way in and pinch it out. It came out very slowly and I felt sore again. To add to that, there was blood everywhere. There were dollops of blood on the floor, there was some on my thighs along with mucus and my hands were also covered.

Yes I've heard there is a learning curve to it and you gradually understand how to use it best. I feel slightly traumatized because of using a bigger size. But I will definitely try again with a smaller cup.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/o8ls8j/menstrual_cup_has_got_to_have_some_effect_on_the/,Menstrual Cup has got to have some effect on the vagina if it is constantly inside?,Menstruation üî¥,90,54,0.93,blasphemasphus

Basically, when I wipe after a bowel movement, I keep going until the toilet paper comes away clean, right? But then sometimes after I pee later in the day, (I always also wipe the back to make sure no drippage has occurred), when I wipe I‚Äôll see some poo on the toilet paper, even if it had been a good while since I‚Äôd defecated.

1464wnq,Healthyhooha,1686415445.0,"Hello lovely people. I‚Äôm on here asking for some advice on behalf of my wife, who is at the end of her rope. She is a non-English speaker and has not found any answers on the Chinese language internet, so here I am asking for her. 

She has been shaving her pubic hair and labia for years, well before she met me. Very, very cleanly shaven with an electric trimmer. She has often gotten the occasional pimple or ingrown hair down there, but according to her things have gotten much more serious in the last few months. 

All of the above is still going on, but she said to me that she has been experiencing very severe labial sensitivity, with her often getting splits that bleed if she doesn‚Äôt wipe with a wet wipe. Often she‚Äôll find that these break back open on her when she thinks they have healed. She‚Äôs basically gone the last half a year wearing pads as a result. 

I‚Äôm posting here because I have literally no idea what might be the issue and simply don‚Äôt have the words to search on Google. I have encouraged her to go to see a doctor about this, but she‚Äôs not sure what kind of specialist to see. A gynecologist? A dermatologist?

Any help is so incredibly appreciated. It took her a humungous amount of courage to talk to me about this. I want to do whatever I can to help her get the help she needs.

Edit: Thank you SO MUCH to everyone for your replies. I now have the several ideas to look into with her, number one being a good gynecologist in our area. I‚Äôll pass on all of the self care suggestions and let her know that many of you shared similar experiences. When she came to me about this last night she felt like a freak with a revolting secret. I‚Äôm sure that knowing she isn‚Äôt alone in having issues will be a gigantic help.

Edit 2: I‚Äôve summarized and shared everyone‚Äôs replies and my wife is feeling a little better about things. She was feeling like she had irreparably damaged herself by shaving all of these years.

uu5v8j,WomensHealth,1653075352.0,"Alrighty! Where do I start?¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†I wanted to write this to raise awareness for my friends out there who may also need a hymenectomy. I had my hymenectomy surgery right before I turned 19, and would‚Äôve loved to see more stories like this one. **So‚Ä¶what is a hymenectomy?** A hymenectomy is a medical procedure involving the surgical removal of the hymen. It occurs in 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 vagina-bearers.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†Before I share my story, I want to tell everyone, hymenectomy or not, that it is important to know your body and to get comfortable with it. You need to know what is normal for you! If something is different from others, that‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of. You are beautiful, inside and out.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†My hymenectomy story begins when I got my first period - it was scary, but empowering for me. For the first few months, I was solely a pad girl. Tampons freaked me out. However, as time went by and I kept declining pool-day invitations, I decided to try a tampon one summer day‚Ä¶ So, here I am, a thirteen-year old girl reading the Tampax Pearl pamphlet that I found in my mom‚Äôs bathroom - a common scene among us teenage girls. I thought I understood the pamphlet and its diagrams completely - use a hand mirror, find your vagina, insert the tampon and there you go - easy, right? Wrong.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†I got a hand mirror, found my vagina, then I tried sitting, squatting, one foot on the toilet & one foot on the ground, etc. - I tried everything and the tampon just wouldn‚Äôt go in - and if I tried to force it, it hurt.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬† I thought, ‚ÄúAlright - maybe just a bad day. I‚Äôll try again tomorrow.‚Äù The next day came and I focused on deep breathing - maybe I was tensing my muscles. I tried the different positions, I tried relaxing - nope, still couldn‚Äôt get it in.¬†‚Äã

¬† ¬† ¬†Years go by and I had now gone through an entire box of tampons and STILL couldn‚Äôt get one in. I would talk about it with my friends and they‚Äôd always say, ‚ÄúJust try breathing and relaxing your muscles‚Äù - which I‚Äôve tried a million times. Or they‚Äôd ask, with a condescending tone, ‚ÄúAre you sure you‚Äôre putting it in the right hole?‚Äù This question pissed me off more than anything. Do you really think I‚Äôm sticking a tampon up my ass? Or in my urethra?¬†‚Äã

¬† ¬† ¬†Then, they‚Äôd say stuff like, ‚ÄúDo you want me to try to do it for you? It‚Äôs not that hard - just shove it in there.‚Äù These comments made me feel so bad about myself. As a teenage girl, I was already so insecure with my body, and these hurtful comments didn‚Äôt help. I‚Äôd tell them that I‚Äôve tried everything, and they would still think I was putting it in the wrong hole.¬†‚Äã

¬†¬† ¬†After all of this tampon trying, when I was about 18, I finally worked up the courage to see an ob-gyn. My mom scheduled the appointment. I went, and the doctor told me I had a septate hymen. Basically, this means that there is a band of your hymen tissue blocking some of your vagina. The doctor said that I could opt for a few rounds of painful, bloody sex, or get a small procedure called a hymenectomy. I chose the hymenectomy.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†My ob-gyn said that some people can have this procedure done using local anesthesia (where they numb the area), but for me I should go under general anesthesia because the band of tissue was pretty thick.¬†

¬†¬† ¬†For months leading up to the surgery, I was so nervous. My first time under anesthesia would be someone popping my cherry. How delightful?! At first, I was a little embarrassed and ashamed, but the more time I gave myself to sit with it - I realized it is nothing to be ashamed of. My body is different; different doesn‚Äôt mean bad; different doesn‚Äôt mean unfeminine; different doesn‚Äôt mean gross. Different is just different.¬†‚Äã

¬† ¬† ¬†Anyway, the day finally came. My dad drove me to the surgery center, they took me back and told me to change into the gown. Luckily, I was able to keep my socks on :) Then, they gave me an IV - that was the worst part. Nurses came in and out, but for a good twenty minutes I was sitting all alone. I was so nervous, but eventually I was rolled into the operating room. 

¬† ¬† The next thing I knew, I was awake and saying ""THAT WAS GREAT! IT FELT LIKE A NICE NAP!"". I didn't know this at the time, but I was told after the fact that when I woke up and was all loopy, apparently I was talking VERY loudly. So here I am loudly¬†telling the nurses that my coochie was burning, and they asked what my pain was on a scale from 1 to 10, and I yell, ""SEVEN."" Looking back at the whole thing, I can't stop laughing.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†My vagina was sore for about the hour after the procedure. As for the rest of the day, I was a little weak and loopy - no problems other than that though. I was nervous for my first pee, because I had read that it might sting - for me, it was completely fine!¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†The next day, I woke up and started my period. I was nervous about an infection or that it would hurt, but again - it was fine! The doctor told me to rest for about 3-4 days, but I actually went rock climbing the day after the procedure - with a harness and everything. I genuinely felt fine. This probably wasn't too smart looking back at it, but I was a teenager on summer break and didn't want to waste it.¬†‚Äã

¬† ¬† ¬†With all that being said, this is not everyone's experience. Some people really need to rest for a week or two, some need Tylenol every few hours, some feel a burning sensation when they pee. However, this was not the case for me - and I am very grateful.¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†The main takeaways are that, for me, this surgery truly wasn't that bad. I hope this post helps calm someone's nerves out there. I also just want to say, **it is a strong thing to take your health into your own hands.** I knew something was wrong, and I chose to see an ob-gyn long before I've ever had sex. I knew something was off, and I wanted to fix it. **Take your health into your own hands and don't be ashamed!**¬†

¬† ¬† ¬†If you are getting this surgery anytime soon, I wish you the best of luck! Try not to worry too much!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/uu5v8j/my_hymenectomy_story/,My Hymenectomy Story,,88,20,1.0,Confident_Yam6447

Read the article here: [https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/25/us-house-of-representatives-passes-womens-health-protection-act/](https://www.nationofchange.org/2021/09/25/us-house-of-representatives-passes-womens-health-protection-act/)

Supported by a broad coalition of more than 100 organizations committed to reproductive health, rights, and justice, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act. The vote to ‚Äúprotect the right to abortion across the country‚Äù is the first legislation of its kind that is specifically designed to protect the right to abortion access nationwide.

The bill, H.R. 3755, passed in a 218-211 vote. It will counteract abortion bans such as the S.B. 8 in Texas as well as one in Mississippi‚Äôs, which will be heard by the Supreme Court this year.

‚ÄúThe House has stepped in where the courts have failed us,‚Äù Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said. ‚ÄúThis historic vote is the first time legislation has advanced in Congress to establish a right to abortion. Now the Senate must act or the current crisis on abortion access in Texas could reverberate across large swaths of the nation.‚Äù

According to a poll conducted by Hart Research Associates, a majority of voters (61 percent) want a nationwide federal law protecting abortion rights to override restrictive abortion laws at the state level.

‚ÄúAt a time when states like Texas have heightened attacks on reproductive justice, it is imperative that the federal government steps in to defend abortion care across our nation,‚Äù Kimberly Inez McGuire, executive director at URGE: Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equity, said. ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act is a crucial step toward making abortion access a reality.‚Äù

The Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act was introduced in the House by U.S. Representatives by; Judy Chu (D-CA), Lois Frankel (D-FL), Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Veronica Escobar (D-TX), and in the Senate by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI). As of current, the bill has 47 co-sponsors in the Senate.

‚ÄúAlong with ending abortion coverage bans and ensuring access for young people who need abortion, passing WHPA gets us closer to a day when our decisions are truly our own,‚Äù Inez McGuire said.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/pwoj6z/us_house_of_representatives_passes_womens_health/,US House of Representatives passes Women‚Äôs Health Protection Act,News,89,6,0.99,NationofChange

l4dkcq,TwoXSupport,1611540861.0,"Hi TwoXSupport! So I'm looking for a bit of advice and support here with a weird situation that happened last time I got my hair done. 

I tried a new salon back in August with a stylist who came highly recommended for textured hair - it's really hard to find that where I live.  The stylist was friendly but almost too friendly asking pretty personal questions and specifics about where I work  (I'm a bartender so I'm a bit exposed if somebody wants to try find me) and kept asking even after several attempts of me deflecting.  Nothing too strange until the end of my cut he decides he's going to check the length is even both sides. 

He takes strands of hair from either side and drapes them down my chest and brushes quite purposely against my nipples.  My hair is about armpit length and no way long enough to reach my breasts. 

I ask him what he's doing and he says ""sorry I have to check the length"" and does it twice more, slowly and deliberately while giving me the weirdest eye contact in the mirror and really leaning into my nipples this time.  I dont understand why he couldn't check the length down my back if that's what he was really doing. 

I have a history of abuse and just wanted to get the hell out of there.  I paid and left. ‚òπÔ∏è

It didn't sit right with me and I spoke to my partner and friends about it.  My friends all either have much longer or shorter hair than I and none had ever had an experience like this.  They encouraged me to ring the salon and make a complaint. 

I called and asked for the lady stylist who had been cutting hair in the chair beside me and basically through tears told her what happened.  I was so embarrassed for the crying and just so flustered by the whole thing but she was absolutely lovely and asked what I would like to do. I hadn't really thought about that so I had no idea how to answer and just continued to cry. 

She said she would have a word with the owner and the stylist who touched me inappropriately would be told about my complaint, that he had made somebody very uncomfortable and warned to be more careful of peoples space in future. She said she would keep my name out of it. She was lovely. 

Thing is I've been having body memories since and am unable to let my partner of 6 years anywhere near my chest.  It turns my stomach and I just cant seem to get passed it. 

I don't know if its worth reporting to the authorities as it was done on the outside of my clothes and there was no skin to skin contact and I know it's really minor on the scale of assaults.  I cant ring the salon to follow up as they've all been closed again due to covid.

kynh78,Healthyhooha,1610819169.0,"I've been struggling with recurrent vaginal yeast infections since March of 2019, and they spread to my anus over a year ago. These infections have been confirmed by a vaginal swab, as well as one swab of the crack area, and I got STD screenings done several times as well to confirm that this is indeed a yeast infection. I've discussed it with multiple doctors (sadly I don't have GP so they've always been different people, but they have all been empathetic if maybe uninformed), and the treatments have been as follows:

- The first two times or so, I took the drugstore canestin treatment. These went away, but I was reinfected by my partner, who later did get treated himself which helped for a while.
- The symptoms kept returning, so I was given a prescription for oral fluconozale. These worked at removing one infection, and then when the infection came back, I was prescribed a more of it so I could take it consistently (150mg every 72 hours for three days, then once a week for a month).
- Months after taking the full fluconozale treatment, I began to feel more itching behind my vagina on my taint area and towards and around my anus. I went back to the doctor and was prescribed Lamasil for the area after she did a visual exam and a swab, confirming again that it was yeast. 

Since then, the itching has waned when I've been in a dry environment (to the point where it almost went away), but always come back after having sex with my partner (he was probably reinfecting me, and he was treated twice with topicals and oral fluconozale). Most recently a doctor prescribed me another series or oral fluconozale (150mg every 72 hours for three doses) and another topical like canestin, and the same for my partner. 

The problem at this point isn't even that my vagina is still itchy. In fact, the result of the last vaginal swab I did with that doctor was NEGATIVE for yeast. The yeast is clearly still present in my asscrack and gets transfered to my vagina while having sex. I've tried apple cider vinegar, yogurt, monistat, canestin, more lamasil, and even was prescribed a small amount of topical steroid cortisol for the area.

 NOTHING has provided any amount of relief except for being in a dry environment. I don't have health insurance yet (waiting period) and because of COVID it's difficult for me to see a doctor at a free clinic. I'm at my wits end and would appreciate ANY advice anyone has for how to treat this. It's seriously effecting my self esteem and my sex life (it's recently made it impossible to have sex, because I'm so worried about getting reinfected and the itch and burning is so extreme). For context, I also live in Canada so I can buy more products OTC at the pharmacy than in the US -- and I have the packaging of previous anti fungals I've been prescribed and the pharmacist can consult with me on a better product.

jwnbeo,WomensHealth,1605730159.0,"Last year, I (f17) went to the gynecologist for the first time. I'm not going to go into too much detail, because I don't like thinking about it too much, but it was really bad. It was not just ""unpleasant"" or ""uncomfortable"". It was excruciatingly painful. It was a sharp, burning sensation, and I could not stop crying. The doctor took out the speculum (it wouldn't go all the way in anyway) and tried using her fingers, but it was just as painful as the speculum and I continued to cry and move away from her, so she stopped. After that, the nurse just gave me a tissue and the doctor left for a minute so I could put my clothes back on. The purpose of the appointment was to prescribe birth control, which I did receive, but the exam itself was never brought up again, and I was too upset to talk about it with anyone after the appointment was over.

 The appointment caused me to reflect back on my other experiences with vaginal pain. I don't wear tampons regularly, but the few times I have, it would take me a long time to insert it and once I had it inside, I could still feel it no matter what size tampon I used or how I inserted it. The times that I had tried masturbating with my fingers, I could get one finger inserted, but I could not move it around without it being painful, so I would stop pretty quickly. I thought that all this stuff was normal, because everyone is always saying that it's ""supposed to hurt your first time"" so I just assumed I was experiencing pain, because I'm a virgin. I'm also a lesbian, so I thought that maybe that had something to do with it, although even that sounds stupid. Even my mom said that my first gynecological exam would be ""uncomfortable"", and I believed it, but the appointment was so much worse than just uncomfortable. It was traumatizing.

I tried talking to my mom about the appointment, but she just brushed it off by saying that pain was normal and that I was overexaggerating it. I know that eventually, I will have to go back to the gynecologist for another appointment, because even though I did not need a pap smear (or the birth control, but I'm still in the closet) at that time, I'll soon be at the age where I'll need routine ones to check for cervical cancer and stuff. What should I do???

Edit: I didn't expect to get so many responses! Thanks so much for all the support! I've decided to make this edit to clear up some questions in the comments and to respond to the great advice. 

1. Technically, I did not have to have an exam to get birth control. The doctor told me that since I wasn't sexually active, she didn't need to do the exam, but my mother wanted me to get one anyway, because that's what she did when she first got birth control. I did have a pelvic exam, but they weren't actually able to take a pap smear, since the speculum would not go all the way in. 

2. As I said in the post, I'm a lesbian, so technically I didn't need birth control, but I'm not out to my parents, and my mom really wanted me to go on birth control, so I kind of had to go along with it. However, I stopped taking it a few months ago under the excuse that it made me gain weight, and fortunately, my mom hasn't questioned it. Although, I'm sure she'll want me to start taking it again once I'm in college, but we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. 

And finally, 3. Thank you for sharing your experiences with vaginismus and pelvic pain. To be honest, I kind of already knew that it was probably vaginismus (or something similar) but initially, I was too scared to talk to anyone about it, because I just felt like a diagnosis would make it too real and I was still in denial that there was a problem. Reading your responses has made me realize that 1. I do have a problem and 2. That there is a solution. Once I leave my parents, which will be very soon, I will try to seek a diagnosis and treatment, so thank you to everyone who responded to this post; it really made me feel better about all of this.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jwnbeo/f17_traumatizing_pelvic_exam/,(f17) Traumatizing Pelvic Exam,,88,19,0.97,None

jm1i1l,Healthyhooha,1604233957.0,"Hello.

Pretty sure this can be posted here. Here‚Äôs to hoping. It may be long, just need to share this with someone.

So, a couple years ago I decided it was time for me to switch to the menstrual cup, but was still doing research on the right cup and hearing people, and still had a ziplock full of tampons.

Right before last Christmas, I was about to get my period. And I ran to the store to get tampons. I noticed that they were slightly expensive, but still got them - I had just moved to Italy. 

I went to visit a friend of mine in Switzerland and noticed that tampons were waaaaaay cheaper (I mean, in Italy a box of 16 tampons were almost if not 4 euros. In Switzerland a box of 40 or a little more than 40 were 4 euros). So I got 2 boxes, one of super and one of regular and still had some tampons on the tampon box. And during this Summer, I was going to spent an afternoon in another town and was late for the train when I realized my period was about to start, so I got a box. This threw me off of starting the cup, because I had to wait to finish all of those tampons. 

My last cycle I realized that I only had enough tampons for another cycle, and got happy because then I would have no excuse to not switch. The other day I saw a accessible cup at the pharmacy, and will get it in a couple weeks. 

I got my period on Thursday. Over the years my period has shifted from day 1 being heavy and then medium and light, to now day 1 being light, day 2 HIGH, then it slowly fades. On Friday it felt pretty reasonable and not a heavy flow. Was with friends and we talked about periods, and leaking and I was like havent leaked on the bed in forever. Yesterday, day 3, I leaked over my shorts and then pants. Still okay, no big deal.

This morning, I wake up and check the bed and notice a small blood stain, and was like okay, its fine, guess I jinxed it and kept sleeping. Until I woke up because I felt too wet. Oh lord! I got up, ran to my bag of tampons, could feel blood running down my legs, squeezed in tight and ran to the bathroom. Luckily I was wearing black underwear, but it was soaking wet, that it left tiny droplets on the floor. I could feel my thighs wet when I sat in the toilet. Had a shit ton of clots on the tampon, HUGE. When I wiped myself even more clots. Had to jump in the shower after to wash the blood of legs. Wipe the floor, for all the tiny blood drops. Wash the panties. Literally a blood bath! 

Never in my 15 years of having a period I had such a messy situation. Not even when I had just started and would have a heavy flow on day 1 and leak everywhere. I was so shocked and surprised and couldnt really figure who to share this with, so decided to share it with the strangers of the internet.

My curiosity is what leads to these blood clots. 

To whoever read this, thank you so much. 

Really hoping my journey with the cup is easier.

**TL;DR**: woke up with with blood running down my legs and huge clots on my tampon and toilet paper. Wonder what causes it.

jjaq2g,WomensHealth,1603835220.0,"I got off the Depo Provera in January of this year and can‚Äôt believe how much my menstrual cycle actually affects my life. I‚Äôm upset I didn‚Äôt realize this when I was a teenager because I feel like I attributed a lot of my mood changes to mental health issues rather than normal changes in hormones. 

For the first time in my life I feel...normal?

For example, I can tell exactly when I‚Äôm ovulating now because I think about sex 24/7 during that time. I remember being a teenage girl and getting frustrated during those times because I didn‚Äôt know why I felt that way. And then suddenly one day I‚Äôm just...poof! Back to normal non-sexual thoughts. 

Same with PMS. I generally feel insecure and sad during the week before my period. As a teenager this devastated me, but now that I‚Äôve realized it‚Äôs a regular thing related to my hormones, it‚Äôs so much easier to cope with. I also get fatigued and out of breath during this time and always thought I had somehow developed asthma, but I learned this is actually a symptom of PMS, which makes sense because I‚Äôve been tracking it and it always happens a week before my period. 

I guess I just wanted to say how relieved I am to know that the absolutely confusing changes in my mood and body now have an explanation.

jdktc5,TwoXSupport,1603043692.0,"Today I got permanently banned from a subreddit focusing on feminism.  I've rarely commented there, but the comments and post were about sex work.  I strongly feel that any woman (or any person) who is coerced in any way into sex work, that is abhorrent and wrong.  I also feel if a woman decides she wants to do something with her own body, that she shouldn't be shamed for it.  I don't think the sex work industry is All Good and Great and Empowering, but I don't think that it's necessarily exploitative either, for everyone.  It boils down to if someone is being exploited, it's wrong.  Full stop.  If someone wants to do this, for what ever reason, sex work is real work and they should have the support of other women and the law.

I responded to a commenter who said something similar to this and said that until we have better social safety nets, there will be people who are forced into sex work who don't truly want to be doing it.  That by having something like Universal Basic Income, we can ensure almost everyone who does sex work is someone who wants to be doing it.  I have done call center work and linked it back to the mental break down that caused me, and the horrible things said to me by callers, when I was forced to sit and listen to it as they said they hoped I got aids and died.  As a man masturbated in my ear and moaned and I was not allowed to hang up until a manager could be located to take the call.  I ended up on medication for depression and anxiety and managed to get out after five years.  And I said no one selects any job, mostly, because they love it.  They all need money.  It's sort of all economic coercion.  And UBI would help with that.   I really do feel its relevant to many of the comments saying that women are coerced into sex work by economic pressure.

I replied to the ban, as the ban comment told me I could, asking why I'd been permanently banned.  I got a very terse response, saying ""you've been found in breach of the informativity rule, sidebar. no further communication is wanted. ""  And then they muted me from contacting any moderator.

The rule I've been said to have broken is ""**All posts must come from an educated perspective**

Informativity rule: all ideological considerations must show actual understanding of the relevant feminist concepts. Comments consisting of exploratory/follow-up questions, in good faith, are an exception.

Please avoid: biases coming from a position of privilege (gender, race, class, sexual orientation); conflating informed consent with formal consent (consider past trauma/PTSD, emotional/mental issues, or coercion); fetishizing choice (when choice itself is insufficient: selling one's vote).""

I know it's an internet group, but something in me is really upset that sharing a good faith opinion that I've read about, thought on and believe is entirely relevant is so bad.  Am I the asshole here?  I am a woman.  I have tried very hard to educate myself on this subject. I do believe what I said.  I didn't put anyone down for believing differently.

I'm French and I have been tested for everything under the sun multiple times via blood test, urine and vaginal samples and it always came back negative except for labial herpes (HSV-1) but I never had labial or genital sores.

In my vaginal swabs, I was tested for Ureaplasma so we never suspected it could be the culprit. But here is the catch: the lab only tested for *Ureaplasma urealyticum*. My JunoBio tests reveal that I have 2.5% of *Ureaplasma Parvum*. This strand can be responsible for bacterial vaginosis hence why I also have 8% of Gardnerella vaginalis. 

So after consulting 3 gynecologists, 2 midwives, and my general doctor I never had answers. I got treated for yeast infections (never tested positive for yeast), herpes (never got sores), and lately I though I had vulvodinya so I'm taking amitriptyline for a month. They all told me I had nothing, that I was just too stressed out, that I should change my soap and wear cotton underware. They never ever took the time to think about the details and look into another direction.

I had to spend close to $200 to take this test and only now I start to have answers - when all this crap started in January. I am so angry.

Anyway, hopefully my feedback can help some of you keep faith that their symptoms are valid and that there is a reason why you are in pain, and you should fight to be heard and for your health. Don't take no for an answer. And by the way this Reddit has been an amazing source of information, and it really helped me understand that I was not alone.

qcqvfk,Healthyhooha,1634820005.0,"Hi Reddit,

So I decided to see my gyno about some painful bumps I have on the lower area of the vaginal entrance. I've had them for years at this point and my previous gyno told me ""oh those happen, they don't go away. You can have them surgically removed if you want."" But no explanation as to WHAT they are... Regardless I decided to have my current gyno look at them.

Gyno pokes around and says ""oh maybe it's some remnants of your hymen!"" I have some, yes, but they don't hurt... they're not bumps. These are clearly bumps in one area. And they hurt when you touch them. I try to point them out again to him but he seems like he doesn't know (or care) what they are.

""We can try some trichloroacetic acid on them. It's for genital warts. It will sting for a bit but it'll go away.""""Uhhh is that safe? Will it damage anything?""""No it won't""""Uhh okay I guess""

He dabs me with the acid and it's burning pain. Of course. He says it will ""go away in 30 minutes"". I trust him, and go home.

So nervous as I am I went home and read about TCA. It's commonly used for facial peels as well as genital warts. The reason it works is it targets the proteins the warts are made of. It damages normal skin, though. Which is why it works for facial peels. He neglected to tell me that it also turns the skin white (as it's chemically burning it off).

So it's now day 4 and a thick layer of my vagina skin has burned off, leaving a bloody mess underneath. The bumps? They're still there. And they probably still hurt. I can't really tell, the whole area hurts.

TL;DR went to gyno and he used wart-removing acid on a sensitive area of my vag as an ""experiment"", and all it did was burn my skin off and make me bleed a bunch. Anyone here know what the bumps might be?? I need to find a new gyno now. I've seen three and none of them are giving me an answer on what these freaking things are. :( and all that's happened is I've gotten ""oh idk get surgery"" (which is what I was hoping for in the first place) or I get experimented on.  


UPDATE: Thanks for all the kind words. I called the gyno back and explained what happened and he told me the bleeding/skin coming off is ""normal and will heal in a few weeks"" and ""well I suspect it's not warts then""... yes that's a safe conclusion lol... I hope he's right. It looks a bit better today, still bleeding. I really wish he warned me about any of this or I may have turned down this treatment due to it not being warts.

I don't have any strength left. I need it to all be over and done with, and the trial is still way in the future. I can't take all of the hiccups in the court process anymore. I can't take all the phone calls waking me up in the morning, and the emails. The fucking half a dozen ""resources centres"" that are meant to have my back whose names are acronyms of the same 6 letters that I can never tell a part. 

I'm fucking done, I can't do it anymore. I wish I could back up, rewind. I wish the court process was easier on victims so that they didn't have moments of regret, like I am now, about reporting his sick behaviour to the police to begin with. 

I am dreading the trial, where I am going to be made to look like a liar and a fraud. Or a pathetic victim. All of these stupid hiccups in the process leading up to the trial are meant to tire me out. The Defence does it intentionally. Asking for documents they already have. Requesting documents that do not exist. Requesting documents that breach my reasonable right to privacy. 

But more than anything, I wish I didn't ever meet him. I fucking hate him. I hate that we exist on the same planet, and I hate that he will likely continue to keep hurting others, no matter what his conviction will be. I hate that I worry about running into him, and that every time I see his model of car I do a double-take. 

My life and my heart and my body are heavier having known him. 

A lot of tears shed today. I'm just so tired. 

And now I have an essay to finish, cause I'm gonna be a fucking success story, and get this degree, no matter what trauma I have that makes it harder.

I‚Äôve posted a few times bout this yellow discharge I was having along with high WBC counts in my urine. I was tested for every STI, given doxycycline, and nothing came back positive.

It‚Äôs cervical ectropion! 

It‚Äôs basically an overgrowth of the glands, which secrete way more mucus and are infected. My gyno compared it to a oozing zit (gross, right). 

The gyno took a biopsy to rule out a few other things. I have some cream, and I‚Äôm scheduled for a procedure in June. 

I was really starting to believe I had cancer or PID or an STI that wasn‚Äôt being caught like ureplasma. 

One of the possible causes is hormonal (gyno even asked if I was on birth control). I‚Äôve been trying to tell my family doctor that my hormones have been messed up since weaning and taking an SSRI, and wasn‚Äôt believed.

Looking forward to finally having some resolution.

I was in the shower and decided to pee a little bit so i could clean the discharge from my BV. When I pissed I felt something similar to a blood clot passing during a period. Except it was less red and more light pink and fleshy. And it felt more firm. It wasn‚Äôt liquid like my usual discharge and it fell out in one chunk. I didn‚Äôt get a good look at it because the water swept it away and I wasn‚Äôt wearing my glasses.

After this happened I felt a dull pain in my vagina and my stomach started mildly cramping. When I got out of the shower I went to wipe and there was blood, but it was very light. Then the dull pain turned into an occasional sharp feeling that would occur for only a second and then stop for a couple of minutes. I tried to find answers on google and found absolutely nothing, so I just went to bed.

This morning I woke up and peed and when I went to wipe there was more blood than there was last night. It was still a light color rather than a period-red. 

I have no idea what to make of this. I know its not a miscarriage because it would‚Äôve been much more bloody. Plus I took a pregnancy test a few weeks ago and it was negative. The closest answer I found was a decidual cast. Could that be what it is?

Additional info that may be important: I have been on testosterone for 3 years. I take norethindrone. I have been struggling with constant UTIs, yeast infections, and (currently) BV for over a year.

Ive had pneumonia symptoms for close to a week now and have just generally felt awful so I went to the doctors with my mum. 

They, two doctors, were quick to diagnose me with herpes with just a visual examination and said although I‚Äôve never had sexual contact of any kind they still believe it to be herpes and have sent me off with anti viral meds and little to no advice on herpes itself. I‚Äôve since done some Googling and it says it‚Äôs ALMOST impossible to catch without sexual contact so I‚Äôm not sure if they didn‚Äôt believe me but oh well. 

I‚Äôve got another appointment tomorrow with the sexual health clinic instead of the general doctors but wanted to know if there‚Äôs any specific questions or causes I should ask about. Today has been very earth shattering to me as I‚Äôve been told I have a life long STI without experiencing any sexual contact and will obviously have to tell any future partners so I‚Äôve been quite upset and cried a few times already as it‚Äôs incurable.

I went to a sexual health clinic and had a trainee and a specialist have a look, they said it‚Äôs unlikely to be herpes but they can‚Äôt rule it out for sure without tests so I‚Äôve now been tested for most STIs with swaps or blood tests so hopefully the results will have some answers.

The way the story was written, the way he describes his behaviour and his accusor's behaviour, the tone he used... I think he's lying. I think he did it, knows it, and is trying to defend himself.
Or maybe it's just creative writing, but the comments were all on his side anyway, believing everything he said, telling him to consult a lawyer and everything, as if this was not the perfect embodiment of the usual rapist apologist speech.

I have vagina anxiety. I believe it comes from the lack of sexual education I received, the stigma behind ‚Äúfemale problems‚Äù, and becoming sexually active early in my life. This causes me to freak out with anything that goes on ‚Äúdown there‚Äù. I‚Äôm sure my doctors are fed up with the number of times I‚Äôve come in insisting something was wrong and that I needed their help just for them to tell me what I am experiencing is normal and healthy. This is something I‚Äôve wanted to write about for a long time now and my latest experience finally pushed me to start.

In December of 2020 I began a relationship with someone who was HSV2+. He disclosed to me before we ever engaged in any sexual activity and my reaction was complete acceptance and willingness to move forward in the relationship. I don‚Äôt regret this decision in the slightest and I would make it again if the next person I was to date told me the same. What I *do* regret, however, is not educating myself on HSV before and during the relationship. At the time I was completely uneducated, and so was he, so we took no precautions in protecting myself other than agreeing to abstain from sex if he saw a breakout. In May of 2020 we broke up and then in July I began exhibiting what I thought were symptoms of HSV2. I began a fear-based spiral of research and desperation and at many points I convinced myself that I was HSV2+. However, I am negative for HSV2 (but positive for HSV1, which for me, presents itself on my lips), but the information I learned during my research made me acutely aware of how uneducated I am when it comes to my sexual health. After talking to friends about my experience (we‚Äôre all in our mid 20‚Äôs-early 30‚Äôs) I began to realize it‚Äôs not just me who lacks knowledge about our vaginas and what can happen down there when sexually active and how education can empower us to advocate for our health; both in relationships and with medical professionals. I want to pass on the information I learned and the things I wish I would have known prior to my relationship in December.

I want to start with a disclaimer: I am not a doctor, and this is not meant to be the handbook of genital HSV2. If you see something that you find suspicious or concerning, **go to the doctor now**. Often, the anxiety of not knowing is worse than the diagnosis and it‚Äôs better to have an answer than be in the limbo of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äôs‚Äù. Also, much of this information can be found in the community r/herpes, and I highly recommend going to that subreddit and reading their wiki to further your understanding of HSV. I‚Äôm going to be mostly talking about the things I wish I would have known and what I experienced.

**First, HSV is incredibly common:** According to Terrie Warren, the leading practitioner in the world of herpes, 56% of people ages 14-49 have HSV1 and 16% of the same age group have HSV2. However, many people are asymptomatic and do not know they have either HSV1 or 2, but they can still pass on the virus even when not showing symptoms.

**Second, the CDC** ***does not*** **recommend testing if there are no sores present:** There are two ways to test for herpes: a swab and a blood test that looks for antibodies. The swab is the most accurate way to test for herpes, but it does need to be taken before the sore begins to heal, which is why it‚Äôs so important to go to a doctor as soon as you possibly can when you see something suspicious. The blood test that looks for antibodies is less accurate as it misses 30% of HSV1 and 8% of HSV2. The blood test also gives false-positives which can lead to concern and an improper diagnoses. It is critical to understand the limitations of the blood test before receiving one and that information can be found in r/herpes wiki.

**Third, to get the most accurate blood test you need to wait 12 weeks** ***post exposure:*** At 3 months 50% will show antibodies for HSV and at 12 weeks beyond 92% will show antibodies. You may see that some recommend 16 weeks post exposure, but this is old information and Terri Warren no longer suggests having to wait that long.

**Fourth, what this means is most people do not actually know their HSV status:** When someone goes in for their routine STD panel they may assume that they are being tested for herpes, but unless they specifically request it, they are not getting an HSV test. This is why it is important to understand the limitations of HSV blood tests if you want yourself and your partner to get tested.

**Fifth, do not let a doctor or gynecologist visually diagnose you:** Doctors are surprisingly uneducated when it comes to the herpes virus. Some may misdiagnose a sore for something else or they may insist that the lesion they see is not indicative of herpes when, in reality, it is. **Demand for the sore to be swabbed.** It is important to get an accurate diagnosis for many reasons and the only way to do that is to get a positive swab or blood test. Not someone‚Äôs opinion on what they think it looks like.

**Sixth, those who know of their status will be less likely to spread herpes than those who are asymptomatic and do not know their status:** We have come a long way in terms of understanding how HSV works and those who are aware of their status are able to take precautions that reduce the chances of transmission. By taking suppression medicine and using a condom the risk of transmission can be lowered to 1%.

**Seventh, the signs of HSV do not always look like google pictures and descriptions:** When you look up pictures for herpes you are seeing the worst-case scenarios and the virus does not always present itself in that way. First, if you already have one strain of HSV it is highly likely you won‚Äôt get what people call a ‚Äúprimary outbreak‚Äù. Which means you most likely won‚Äôt have flu symptoms and extremely painful sores. In fact, a herpes lesion or blister can be a single sore or it can present itself as a tiny little cut and they may or may not fill with fluid and be painful. This is why, again, it is so important to go to your doctor if you are experiencing anything you think is suspicious.

**Eighth, not every bump down there is herpes:** This was my biggest lesson during my experience. The vagina is bumpy, it can have little skin tags, you may see fordyced spots, ingrown hairs, and if you fuck with your vagina enough bumps will begin appearing. Don't obsessively check your vagina every day like I did, but be aware of what your vagina looks like. If you already have a clear idea for what is ""normal"" for you and you feel something off you'll have an easier time in determining if what you're seeing is a new bump or just an old skin tag. 

**Ninth, oral herpes (often HSV1)** ***is herpes,*** **and it can be passed to genitals:** Often you‚Äôll hear oral herpes referred to as cold sores and many people, like me, have had cold sores since childhood. Because it is so common there isn‚Äôt as big of a stigma like there is for when the same virus presents itself on someone‚Äôs genitals. *But it‚Äôs still herpes.* HSV1 does not shed as often as HSV2, but as oral sex is becoming more common doctors are seeing more cases of HSV1 on the genitals. Both HSV1 and HSV2 can present orally or genitally.

**Tenth, the stigma is real when it comes to genital herpes but the reality is less severe:** Often times when someone is diagnosed with genital herpes they believe their life is over, that they are dirty, that it‚Äôs something to be shameful about, or that they will never be sexually active again. Yes, the mental battle of accepting this diagnosis and the sigma behind it is real and I am not trying to downgrade anyone‚Äôs experience with the virus; but if you are diagnosed with genital herpes I promise you, your life is not over. No one is dirty: only positive or negative. You will find love again and you will have sex again. Like I said in the beginning of this, I do not regret dating my boyfriend and I would be sexually active with someone that had G-HSV. I know many people who are g-HSV+ that have gone on to date, marry, and have kids- some of which have partners who are negative even after being together for years.

The only way to completely take away the risks of being exposed to HSV is abstaining from sex and kissing, which let‚Äôs be real, we‚Äôre just not gonna do. That‚Äôs why it is so important to educate ourselves on this virus and by doing so we can hopefully ease our minds in the process. We can also help end the stigma by talking more about HSV with our friends and I would put money on you already knowing someone with one strain HSV.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/pxh42l/i_have_vagina_anxiety_herpes_addition/,I have vagina anxiety: herpes addition.,,85,7,0.96,twosticks101

My name is Rachel Tucker and I am a graduate student at the University of Cincinnati. First and foremost, I'd like to thank u/Mcbuffalopants for allowing me to join your community, and for giving me the opportunity to share a study I am currently working on with you. 

I am conducting a research study to learn about the experiences of womxn who have difficulty orgasming, and am sharing this information to see if any of you would be interested in joining. 

The study is open to adults 18 years and older who experience difficulty orgasming, and identify as female and/or were assigned female at birth. Participation will involve taking a short online survey, and doing an interview over the phone, WebEx, or Microsoft Teams. The survey will take about 5 minutes and the interview will take about 30-60 minutes, depending on how much you'd like to share. You will not be given anything to take part in this study. But, being in this study may help researchers understand womxn who experience difficulty orgasming and develop ways to improve their quality of life. 

If you are interested in learning more about or joining this study, please contact me at [tuckerrv@mail.uc.edu](mailto:tuckerrv@mail.uc.edu) or (815) 545-4316.

As the title says, I've had painful sex for what feels like an eternity. Since the day I lost my virginity almost, which was 8-9 years ago. Exception for a few times here and there where it didn't hurt but I didn't really feel any pleasure either. 

I tried to find an answer SO many times. A lot of doctors and exams (because I thought I had vaginism or other stuff) and just NOW I found out that I had a candida infection. Did I have this all these years? No one knows. I should also mention that the painful sex was the only symptom.(burning sensation, I couldn't stand anything inside me, not even a tampon)  

I took vaginal pills in the past for this because I ""had a feeling"" it's candida, but to my surprise none of those pills ever worked for solving my painful sex so I assumed it mustn't be candida. 

After I met an amazing doctor recently, he had me do a proper vaginal test, and turns out the type of candida I had was actually resistant to a lot of medication (it was also sensitive to other ones) so the doc told me to take some oral pills that the candida was sensitive to, and this evening I finally had pain free sex and I can't believe it! I'm still on the treatment but I'm so happy that I finally have results with this medication! 

So if you are currently experiencing painful sex, go to the doctor!! In most cases it's so simple to treat! 

Let me know if you have any questions ‚ù§Ô∏è

LATER EDIT: The type of candida was called candida glabrata and it was resistant to common treatments like clotrimazole and fluconazole. It was though sensitive to nystatin. And that's what I took. I initially took vaginal nystatin suppositories and they had no effect, then the obgyn prescribed me oral nystatin and those worked. 

If you think that you may have a candida infection, please get yourself tested to see exactly which type of candida you have and what medication you need for it.

I do not need penetration to have sexual satisfaction. It's probably the least exciting part of sex for me as it is.

The longest we have gone without having sex is 3 days - I only mention this because I wonder if it is the frequency of intercourse that is causing my issues.

I have been going through these periods of having a painfully sensitive clitoris that will last about 4 weeks then it will go away for about 3 months then it is back. It is not a good sensitivity and if my husband even brushes against it with his hand, tongue, or a toy it is like a seering immediate pain and I find myself even getting a little concerned by it. But, my vulva in general does not have any pain and I can still orgasm (I honestly don't know though if I am having a vaginal or clitoral orgasm when this happens). 

So, basically, I guess, my question is - what do you think could be causing this and what can I do to make it stop? I don't like it at all because it does get in the way of our good time. Thanks so much to anyone who might have any answers.

I have a boyfriend of 3 years and neither one of us has cheated on the other so this is shocking news for us both. I unfortunately have painful sores on my vagina to the point where its unbearable so I had to go to the ER and find out what was going on. My boyfriend has no symptoms of it so we're thinking maybe it's from a previous partner of his and he contacted it without knowing and passed it onto me. He doesn't wear condoms with me and never have with women in the past and never gotten tested because he felt fine. So I'm thinking maybe he caught it and didnt know and carried it all the way up to me. My mom is upset and is accusing him of cheating she thinks he did this to me on purpose. I know for sure he didn't he's very trustworthy. We are thinking he caught it from the past. Can Someone please confirm if this is possible? 

I'm heading to the doctor today and will be getting a full panel testing on everything. I've been on a chlamydia antibiotic and valtrex. I went to an ER that wasn't my primary doctor and that's how I got diagnosed. I also tried using every ointment I could find to sooth the sores. I will come back with results by tomorrow. 

Also here is a little history on how this all happened: I developed these painful open sores that went from just two on Friday to multiple today on sunday. I didn't have any sex all weekend because the pain is just too much. It hurts to walk, sit and wipe. I have to take my hands and guard my inner labia from getting in contact with my urine when peeing because it will burn so bad that I cry. I used a razor two weeks ago on Wednesday I felt a few cuts but didn't think anything of it because I always get those and they go away after a week. I do tend to wipe like a crazy woman, over and over again very thorough because I have fears of missing any urine and don't want another UTI or yeast infection. I will wipe so many times that my skin will get dry and tear. I was sexually active with my partner of 3 years on friday-sun. On Friday during sex I felt a little something on one side of my labia but ignored it because it wasn't enough for me to stop being sexually active. From Monday to Thursday I was fine, I didn't feel anything severe. I was peeing, wiping and sitting just fine. Once again it felt like razor cuts. On Friday I took a look at it and saw two small sores, one was white and the other was red. It started to progress from there, becoming multiple sores all the way down to my vulva. I couldn't sit without adjusting my position after a few seconds. I tried over the counter ointments as in neosporine with lidocane, and vagisal cream, vaseline, A+D and aloe vera gel with a witch hazel panty liner. Prior to that I had such a painful time during peeing that I officially took myself to the ER. The doctors didn't seem to have an exact diagnosis. He said it looks like herpes and prescribed me an antibiotic for herpes(valtrex). He also said it could be a transfer from my boyfriend having a canker sore in his mouth last month which we found out was impossible. The doctors didn't seem to know and kept getting other doctors for another opinion. Could it be possible that this was the cause from my razor and my excessive wiping causing open cuts to get infected and spreaded?

161ck2b,WomensHealth,1693000719.0,"(Warning:  May be triggering, contains child abuse)

To preface, I'm in my mid-20's and and just got engaged to my fianc√©, whom I have been recently planning our future together with, down to housing, careers and having kids as we have always wanted. But I happened to think of the possibility that having kids may not be possible due to alternative medicine treatments my mother used to put me through as a teen since she never liked traditional medicine and thought natural and alternative medicine worked better to solve root problems.

These altmed treatments included having me go on juice cleanses, water cleanses, and very restrictive 0 carb 0 sugar 0 fat vegan diets, in addition to having me take shots of essential oils every morning to clear out the parasites she thought I had in my system, going to a colonics office to get said parasites flushed out, and taking shots of olive oil and food grade hydrogen peroxide every morning to finish the job. And after the hydrogen peroxide cleanse phases I would have to take probiotic pills.

Not sure where she got her research from that told her that these would cure me of my ailment but either way, I was a healthy teen by all assessments from the Family care provider and the only noticeable issue that I had that she told me we needed to fix was my terribly persistent cystic acne that I inherited from my Dad. And she claimed that my inflammation must have been influenced by my genes, a poor diet, a candida albican yeast infection that I apparently had, and intestinal parasites that had been flushed out during one colonics visit. 

As a minor living under her roof who didn't know better, I didn't really have a choice but to oblige, but it got to its worst when she escalated the treatments to include injecting food grade hydrogen peroxide into my vaginal canal, which apparently would kill the infection in there. I ended up having to perform it on myself in the bathroom and had to lay back with my legs pointed in the air to let it sit and get to all the areas, but as soon as I injected it I felt the most intense burst of pain I've felt in my life that had me feeling like someone torched me on fire from the inside and started stabbing me repeatedly. I couldn't keep going and flushed it out with water the best I could and laid in bed sobbing because the pain wouldn't subside. I tried taking OTC painkillers which didn't work, so my dad ended up giving me one of his Oxycodone pills he had left over from a previous injury to get through the pain, and it managed to work well, even putting me to sleep. I didn't have any more pain after that ordeal and my mother commented that my skin looked clearer than the day before so it must have meant that the treatment worked and we should try again, but I rejected it due to my traumatizing first experience, so the treatments started to get more tame again after that since I guess she realized she went too far.

It's been almost 10 years since then and I have clear skin now. I no longer live with and rarely speak to my mother, eat a normal diet and don't partake in any alternative medicine treatments. I also pretty much forgot that this even happened due to getting caught up with life, but my recent discussions with my partner raised the idea that I could have damage that was more extensive than I thought in my reproductive system, which could possibly prevent me from successfully conceiving and carrying.

Am I overthinking? I still have a regular period and the last time I had a PAP smear the PCP let me know everything showed up fine in the tests.

One co-worker really annoyed me with the things she was saying. First she started saying how wonderful babies are and how terrible it is when they turn into teenagers. Then she started in about how terrible it is having girls. 

So I spoke up and said It is wonderful having a girl, You get to enjoy prom, sleepovers, birthday parties, and when they turn teenagers you can talk about boys and dating. And it's great when they become teenagers because you can have actual adult conversations with them. I love having daughters! The other co-worker disagrees and says more stuff about how terrible it is having girls, so finally I spoke up and said,

""There is NOTHING wrong with being a girl!!"" 

The whole room was quiet. For a good minute. 

I was fuming inside. I HOPE I made people think about the things they say about how terrible it is to have daughters, and how that affects a woman's self esteem.  Oh yeah, this is not in some third world country where baby girls are aborted for the simple crime of being female, this is in the USA. 

And this is a WOMAN saying this stuff! I hate how people, including women are so brainwashed by the patriarchy, they think having a girl is a tragedy! Do they not THINK about how that makes their daughters feel?

14lezil,Healthyhooha,1687971806.0,"so tuesday last week i was showering and felt a sharp pain on my bikini line between my labia majora and my thigh. i felt what seemed to be a small crater and got my girlfriend to take a look, she said she could see what looked like fat inside a small hole that was bleeding a bit. we checked it regularly and it seemed to be healing up and we thought it was weird but as it was healing we didn‚Äôt think too much of it. 

last night however it started hurting again and i just had my girlfriend check it and it‚Äôs opened up again. there‚Äôs no blood or fat this time though and the hole seems pretty deep. i have absolutely no idea what‚Äôs going on, i‚Äôd be grateful for any help. 

i‚Äôve posted pictures on my account!

edit: if i go to get it checked out, should i go to a gp/normal doctor or to a gynaecologist? just as it‚Äôs not directly related to the vagina and also it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to get an appointment with a gynaecologist here (germany)

edit 2: just because i feel like it‚Äôs important/relevant information, i felt absolutely no pain, no lumps or anything there before. i‚Äôm also very active, i go to the gym regularly and do kickboxing, in case that‚Äôs relevant

UPDATE: it was nothing! we went to the non-emergency clinic and were seen immediately by a doctor who took a look at it, cleaned it, and gave us some gauze to put over it to make sure it stays open and can breathe. basically said it was a wound but clearly not infected or in danger of infection, thank god",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/14lezil/help_random_hole_on_bikini_line/,help! random hole on bikini line,,85,35,0.98,hooha_throwaway

Long story short, we broke up after a year and it didn‚Äôt end on the best note. I got a rebound a few weeks later and hooked up with him after a very nice date. I didn‚Äôt allow oral and had penetrative sex with protection at all times. I went to get tested 2 months later because I‚Äôd met a new guy and had been getting to know each other over several weeks. I made a suggestion that we should both go get tested because I‚Äôm of the understanding that you need to test between partners. He came back clean, i came back with gonorrhea which i had no symptoms. Had I not gotten checked I would still have not known. I immediately had a meltdown. I had only slept with 2 people my entire life thus far and my immediate thought was to begrudgingly contact my ex first to let him know. I suspected him because in my mind it would make sense that it would‚Äôve come from him since we had unprotected sex. He received the information well but lo and behold he got tested just to come back clean as well. I immediately contacted the guy I went on that date with to inform him after receiving my ex‚Äôs results.

ikb0de,WomensHealth,1598923496.0,"A little background: Ever since I became sexually active I started having UTIs from once a month to about once a week. I saw so many doctors who gave me the same advice that didn't work. I was prescribed sooooo many antibiotics I eventually developed sensitivities to many of them. I needed a solution and I really didn't know where to start. The burning.. oh the horrible burning. The doctors who didn't listen or care or believe. I'm hoping this helps any of you who were in the same boat as me.

I haven't had a UTI in about 8 months now, and this is what I did, and what I believe you should try:

1. I bought a squatty potty. [https://www.squattypotty.com/](https://www.squattypotty.com/). Doesn't have to be this brand, but just anything you can have your body in a squat position while you defecate and urinate. If you have a larger than normal mons pubis, like I do, I recommend holding it up and taught so you can have a more direct stream of urine out of your urethra. My reasoning was I wanted to keep my fecal matter far from possibly entering my urethra and also help the anatomy of peepee area be open and not strained. When I'm not at home and need to go, I lean forward, ball my fist, and rest it against my lower abdomen to make sure I'm emptying while on my tippy toes. Try to be in the squat position.
2. I have baby wipes for particularly soft stools. Clean your butthole, ladies. squeaky clean!
3. Eat/take fiber, the less you strain and the more solid the stool is, the better. I like metamucil.
4. Wipe front to back. You probably already do this, but it's worth mentioning. If your urethra is feeling tender, pat it dry.
5. Don't hold your urine! When you got to go, go asap. No pushing it, no ""firehose"", keep it calm and steady.
6. Cranberry juice = bad advice. The ridiculous amount of sugar in cranberry juice feeds the bacteria. Doctors recommend this because it's old advice and really it's just the trace amount of D-mannose in cranberries that helps. You can buy a supplement of this. I would take it as soon as I felt symptoms. It stops bacteria from attaching to the walls of the urinary tract.
7. This one I suspect helps the most: wash your butthole with hibiclens once a week. It's a really strong antimicrobial soap so you don't want it to get in your vulva.
8. Take a probiotic supplement or drink kefir. Kefir has many bacterial strains that will contribute to your vaginal flora which competes with the harmful bacteria.
9. If you have sensitivities to adhesive, like you get redness when having stickers on your skin, I recommend changing your underwear after removing a pad unless you're putting another pad on. Change pads often.

When you start to feel symptoms: take vitamin c, d-mannose, NSAIDs, and Azo. Drink water. For immediate pain relief, sit on a heating pad. Trust me.

I am not a doctor, but suffering for so long forced me to research and try solutions, and this worked. This really worked. I started focusing on this method of keeping my stool healthy and my butt clean after talking to a couple of urologists that came into my job. One said: It's almost always a matter of constipation and unhealthy stools. The other: I had a man who came in having recurrent UTIs, rare for men, because he wasn't using protection when having anal sex.

Here's your shopping list: squatty potty, baby wipes, metamucil, hibiclens, D-mannose, probiotics.

I really REALLY hope this helps. I know how miserable it is. I know how frustrating it is.

idsb8p,TwoXSupport,1597994909.0,"Hey everyone! Maybe this seems like a weird question to some of you, but sometimes I get anxious that I'm expecting too much of the people around me just because I'm so invested in that topic.

  
Anyway, I recently fought with one of my male friends. We were out in the evening and one of his friends (I didn't know him) made a really gross and sexist comment about a girl that was walking by. Nobody else heard it, except our group, because he wasn't talking very loud. I automatically told him that it is not okay to comment on womxn's bodies and that I don't care that he didn't say it to her directly-it's just not okay. We were a group of only men and me. Nobody else said anything, it was just me talking with that man. At that time it didn't bother me, in my head it was like: yeah, well I'm the only woman in this group so I guess it's my job to have that talk.

  
Later, I was walking home with my friend (note that we are really close friends) and I asked him why he didn't say anything to his friend. He told me that he's not affected by cat-calling (true) so he's not in the position to correct his friends on it. So here's my question: what do you think about that? I also like to add that he claims to be a feminist and we always have a lot of talks about topics that concern me. I kind of think that if he wants to be an ally and wants to help to abolish sexist behaviour he HAS to call out his friends. I also think that, sadly, it's always more ""convincing"" if men hear from other men that their behaviour was not ok. I'm not expecting him to have a full discussion about it, after all, he isn't directly affected by it, and the loudest voices should have those, who are affected by it. But just a small comment like dude, that was weird/gross/not okay. Is that too much to ask? As I said, I struggle with anxiety and sometimes I'm afraid to lose friends over my morals because I blow things way out of proportion.

There were some other factors that make me think this is not the true reason, but disregarding that, is this an argument that should be made?

I am not disputing it's a sexist tradition, or at least, that it has sexist roots. But who is it sexist against? *Women*. So if a *woman* wants to partake, is it appropriate to tell her no because it has sexist roots? In a way I feel this removes her agency, as if she is a child who doesn't know what is best for her. ""Silly girl, you can't have an engagement ring because it's sexist against you to have it."" But she wants it, is she not allowed to form her own opinion on that? 

I see this argument come up even within feminism, with some believing women shouldn't be housewives or stay at home moms because that is a sexist tradition.

hoyhoi,WomensHealth,1594419545.0,"I hang mostly in r/menopause and am surprised at how little women know about this stage of their lives (including me), so thought I would throw some light to help those not there yet, think about and prepare for what‚Äôs to come. 

IANAD but have gathered information from my own journey and experiences.  I do not specifically reference surgically-induced menopause (ie: hysterectomies).  This is not an exhaustive account, but generalized info based on my findings.

**Stages of Menopause**

**Peri-menopause**

* Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) start going wacky usually sometime in your 40‚Äôs, where you might feel ‚Äòoff‚Äô, things hurt, hair starts thinning, moods fluctuate etc.
* Late 40‚Äôs ‚Äì 50‚Äôs, things amp up.  Hormones continue to decrease (mostly estrogen). Think PMS symptoms on steroids (bloating, breast pain, cramps) plus irregular periods, missed periods, periods that last much longer/heavier, spotting.  
* The symptom list is long and varied: hair loss, vaginal dryness (atrophy), significant weight gain that settles around your middle and won't budge, saggy, wrinkled skin, loss of muscle-tone, joint aches, heart racing/palpitations, anxiety, hot flashes, night sweats, irritability, depression, crying jags, anger, brain fog‚Ä¶and really anything else that‚Äôs unexplained.  
* Because hormones fluctuate wildly, blood tests do not accurately diagnose peri/menopause (there is no one full-proof test!). However, doctors often default to hormonal blood tests and will flat out state that you‚Äôre not in peri-menopause, even if you‚Äôve been experiencing all the symptoms including skipped periods. The tests do however provide you with a bit of insight into what hormones might be dominant in your system.  

**Menopause**

* You ONLY reach menopause when you‚Äôve gone one full year (12 months) without a period, even spotting counts as a period.  So if you get to 11 months without a period, and then have spotting for a few days, the clock resets back to 1 month and you start the count all over.  
* Once menopausal, there‚Äôs no ‚Äúyay‚Äù moment where all those symptoms magically stop and you‚Äôre suddenly free!   Many women still experience all the same symptoms above (for decades!) or they get worse, but without the period.  So you may still get all the PMS symptoms of a period coming on, but then don‚Äôt get a period.  It‚Äôs like your body is still running cycles as hormones (estrogen) continue to drop.  

**Post-Menopause**

* More than 1 year has passed without a period.  Estrogen is all but gone‚Ä¶and while symptoms can continue for years, the PMS-cycling lessens.  For me, I didn‚Äôt experience any significant symptoms until my 50‚Äôs, periods became erratic at 54 and now at 57, I‚Äôm post-menopausal, so within that short space of time, my body/mind changes were significant and quite startling.  It‚Äôs like I became frail, flabby and old overnight, and again no one talks about this!  (I still have hot flashes that wake me up every night.) Also due to lack of estrogen, we have to now worry about significant increased risk for diseases, especially heart disease, osteoporosis and Alzheimer‚Äôs.  


**General**

* Menopause is different for everyone.  Doctors will ask you to check with women in your family as an indicator of how you‚Äôll go through it ‚Äì this is not reliable.  I have three older sisters and Mom, and we all went through it completely different.  Some women breeze through, some experience debilitating symptoms for years (10+), many fall into the in-between.  
* No one talks about it.  My mother said it was ‚Äòfine‚Äô.  Most people relate menopause only to hot flashes and having no periods.  When in fact, one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and NEVER talked about) is ‚Äúatrophic vaginitis‚Äù, the thinning, drying and shrinking of your vagina‚Ä¶so yeah something to look forward to!
* As many women already can attest to, doctors know very little about women‚Äôs health, and menopause is even further out of their wheelhouse.  Therefore, they are quick to prescribe anti-depressants, pain medication and other band-aid fixes to what sounds like depression (mood swings, irritability, etc) and for random pain.    
* The symptoms of menopause are directly attributed to lack of estrogen.  If you replace the lost estrogen, symptoms will decline/stop as well.  

There are two camps on dealing with symptoms and/or replacing hormones (specifically estrogen)‚Ä¶

1.	Go natural. Vitamins, herbs, supplements, diet, exercise, cooling fans, A/C, cotton sheets, etc.  While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there‚Äôs just not enough evidence to prove that vitamins/supplements work for the debilitating symptoms (like vaginal atrophy, hot flashes, brain fog).  While some supplements/vitamins can improve overall health, they don‚Äôt specifically address the underlying problem‚Ä¶.which is lack of estrogen.  Many estrogens found in soy products may be enough to help with some symptoms, but are not enough to provide preventative benefits associated to larger dose estrogens.  

2.	Go Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) prescribed pills/patches.  HRT was given a bad rap by the WHI 2006 study where panic ensued after reporting that HRT causes breast cancer.  Most anyone today still associates HRT with breast cancer and many doctors will shy away from prescribing it.   However more recent findings indicate that the risks are not statistically significant as originally thought and that HRT along with eliminating symptoms of menopause, also provides long-term preventative benefits to women‚Äôs health.  Specifically:  

* bone health - 2% of bone density is lost every year for the first 5 years after meno and it continues - estrogen will decrease osteo-hip fractures up to 50% (many women who have hip-fractures, are also more likely to die within a year, or don‚Äôt fully recover).
* brain health - women are 2 times more likely to die from Alzheimer's than men - estrogen lowers the risk between 20-50%
* heart health - 1:2 women will die of heart disease - estrogen can reduce heart disease up to 50%
* colon cancer - estrogen reduces the risk by 20-25%
* Diabetes - estrogen seems to decrease the risk, but they don't really know why better skin/hair, less joint pain

**What you can do in preparation and to help mitigate risks:**

* Eat healthier
* Exercise more (build muscle to help with bone loss)
* Take care of your mental health
* Find a good Gyno/Medical practitioner 
* Track and document symptoms
* Gets regular blood work (Thyroid)
* Don‚Äôt chalk anything up to being peri-menopausal ‚Äì get checked out for symptoms that mimic menopause (heart issues, arthritis, etc)
* Arm yourself with knowledge ‚Äì read research (not blogs), form a network (talk to your women friends and relatives), and know that when you hit peri-menopause, you‚Äôre not completely crazy!  
* As with anything medical, be your own best advocate

Menopause is brutal for some, and a skip in the park for others.  My experience is‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a little bit of both depending on which way the hormones are swinging that day.

I am a female in my 20s, and last month I decided to take charge of my body after a terrifying contraception failure. I got the copper IUD, because I wanted a failsafe and a little more control of the situation if a barrier method fails again, since I cannot have a child at this time in my life. 

My mother doesn‚Äôt know, and I‚Äôd like to keep it that way, since she has shamed me about my sex life in the past. She‚Äôs called me a ‚Äúslut‚Äù and a ‚Äúwhore‚Äù during arguments, and I just don‚Äôt feel safe coming to her anymore unless I absolutely have to.

However, something has come up, and I would really like a woman with experience in life, sex, and hoohas to maybe help me out?

I‚Äôm in college, and I will be at home for the next 5 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, I no longer have access to my doctor, or really any doctor for that matter. 

Please note, I have OCD, and can often be considered a hypochondriac. I really just wanted someone to look into my situation and give me some wise words and a little info. It would be absolutely wonderful! 

I‚Äôve been experiencing what I THINK is a UTI. I‚Äôve had really minor ones when I was younger, but this one is bad. My vaginal opening feels tingly and strange, and I feel the urge to urinate‚Äîbut it‚Äôs so painful and difficult to use my muscles(open up my urethra?) to pee! And then when I do pee, the urine burns my vulva and vaginal opening. Im constipated and my sides and lower back hurt, and I feel a pain and fullness right near my bellybutton. Additionally, I have some brown discharge but I‚Äôve been told this was normal after getting an IUD. It was just weird to see it start back up after calming down a bit.

The only reason I am terrified is because of my IUD (whom I have affectionately named cooper the copper). Could I have developed PID? I‚Äôve never had an STD, all 4 of the men I had ever been with are clean, and I‚Äôve just gotten test results to confirm that I am clean as well. The only possible explanation I could think of, is that I accidentally sat in vomit at a party a few days prior to my IUD insertion. It seeped through my leggings and I wasn‚Äôt wearing panties‚Äîso right to my hooha! Could that have caused an infection?

The weekend before leaving for home, and prior to social distancing protocols and practices in our state, I had spent the weekend isolated with my boyfriend. We engaged in intercourse a number of times (at least 4 or 5) and I did my best to make sure to pee after, though I think there were times I forgot or waited a bit. We also used condoms. 
In traveling home, I ended up using the same underwear for about 2-3 days (DISGUSTING, I know, but everything was packed). I‚Äôm wondering if these instances, which happened so close together, caused a UTI?

Prior to all of this, at least a week before, I had a follow up with my doctor, in which she examined my IUD strings and gave me treatment for BV, which she gave me because she ‚Äúsaw a little yeast‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm so sorry for throwing this info out all at once!

A little backstory - when I was 20, I gained 100lbs in 6 months, was sleeping all the time and just generally exhausted. Doctors diagnosed me with primary hypothyroidism. After starting meds, I still felt extremely tired. For the next 10 years, I struggled trying to find a doctor that would understand the level of tired I was at. By this point I was suffering with depression and anxiety because I could not lose the weight and still so horribly tired. I found a doctor that placed me on a biopharmaceutical thyroid medication which seemed to help some. Fast forward another 9 years, so many doctors appointments and all I would get from the docs is ""your thyroid meds need to be changed, it's all related to thyroid"" with no fatigue relief in sight. By this point I had also been diagnosed with pcos and endometriosis, had a hysterectomy in 2015. I had pretty much given up ever feeling normal again. Until we moved to a new state. I found a new primary doctor about 8 months ago. I was extremely reluctant to go through my story for the millionth time, but I hesitated when she asked about my past. She coaxed the story out of me because of my initial reaction to tell her about my past. I have felt for years I had an underlying condition that no one had quite pinned down, but no one ever listen (they always blamed my thyroid, without fail). She made the decision to do a sleep study (which no one had ever mentioned before b/c I don't snore). 3 months ago I finally had my study. I have what is called hypopnea. It is a form of apnea, however, I dont stop breathing but my respiration is so shallow, my brain ""wakes me up"" to regulate my breathing (not enough for me to be aware, but enough to pull me out of REM sleep). This happens to me over 400 times a night. For the past 20 years I have only been getting about 94 minutes of REM sleep per night. I have literally been exhausted and sleep deprived for 20 years. After starting treatment, I feel like a teenager again. I almost gave up, so I encourage anyone who struggles with medical issues to never give up hope. Advocate for your own health and push doctors for further testing. I'm so glad I had that conversation with my new doctor, she literally saved my life.

I was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis back in September, and since then have been struggling to get in under control. But finally, finally, the test results came back negative and I feel the biggest weight off my shoulders. I'll put what worked for me first, and if anyone wants to read my little story/vent, I'll have that at the end.

Boric Acid and probiotics, the real killers here. Basically from mid-October to now, I was using BA 2 times a day, morning and night, and taking the [Jarro-Dophilus probiotics](https://www.amazon.com/Jarrow-Formulas-Jarro-Dophilus-Billion-Capsule/dp/B06X92FWQF/ref=sr_1_6?crid=3888YQCS9V8CQ&keywords=jarro%2Bdophilus%2Bprobiotics&qid=1574571785&sprefix=jarro%2Bdop%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-6&th=1) also 2 times a day. I chose this probiotic in particular because of all the hype I was hearing about Lactobacillus crispatus. I don't know the science behind it, but this research said: [""*L. crispatus* is able to produce several antimicrobial compounds and is inversely associated with BV.""](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3709769/)  Just some reasoning behind my probiotic choice.

For the BA, I tried Boric Life, The Killer, and Queen V. [Queen V](https://www.amazon.com/Queen-Infection-Treatment-Vaginal-Suppositories/dp/B07D5FX2NJ/ref=sr_1_15?crid=1KAOT77CYP939&keywords=queen+v+probiotics+for+women&qid=1574921776&sprefix=queen+v+pro%2Caps%2C135&sr=8-15) was the most recent product I tried leading up to my test results, so this is the brand I will recommend. But these definitely gave me the worst ""leaking"" of all the brands so beware.

No sex, no douching, etc. I'm not on birth control. I did start using the [Queen V feminine wash](https://www.amazon.com/Queen-Feminine-Balanced-Non-Irritating-Gynecologist/dp/B07SZJ4PMM/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=queen+v&qid=1574922923&sr=8-7), whereas before it was only water I was using, but I don't know if that was a cure or anything.

Everyone is different, so I can only share my own personal experience and what worked for me. Keeping the pH balanced with the boric acid and really ramping up on probiotics is how I beat it, and I'll probably continue some type of maintenance routine.

Rant time. I had unprotected sex with a random guy, and a few days later developed that fantastic smell and discharge that people with BV all know and love. Went to the gyno, they started me on the same thing a lot of you started with: the metronidazole pill, which gave me a yeast infection. Went back, was put on the gel, didn't work. By this point, I'd already done some of my own research into BV and found out what a pain in the ass it is. So I didn't go back to the gyno because I didn't want to start a vicious cycle of antibiotics.

Everyone everywhere kept talking about boric acid, and you know I immediately bought that shit. I did not have time to be dealing with this. But it did not work right away like it did for a lot of other people. It eliminates the smell but when I went off it, BV came right back. So I just kept on keeping on it; wearing panty liners all the time because I was leaking like a faucet.

And spending so. much. money. I must have spent at least $200 throughout this whole thing and putting pills in my mouth and in my vag and it sucks. BV just sucks. But the test results came back negative, and I can breathe.

To everyone out there still struggling with this, my heart and love goes out to you. I'm sending positivity and hope, and I know people out there have been dealing with it for years and me only a few months and I can only imagine what that must be like. I did realize throughout all this the lack of fucks given to women's health, and it's not fair or right, and I'm sorry for that too.

About 2 years ago I got my first pelvic exam (no pap smear) done by a male gynecologist while I was on my period (PERFECT scenario for someone with intense anxiety and self confidence issues).

I felt like I was being turned into a popsicle. I was yelping obscenities out loud to get my mind off of it to the point where the nurse practitioner was in tears over how funny it was! I didn't faint or cry when it was over, I was only a little wobbly and shaken up. Not traumatic at all, just overwhelming and unpleasant.

Lately I've been hearing about how great tampons are and how everyone should use them. Everyone in my family had only worn pads, so no one really has any advice for tampons. I took a few freebee tampons from a public bathroom but I can't seem to get the guts to push one in past my labia. My mind goes back to the pelvic exam and how bizarre and uncomfortable it felt. I tried pushing one in a bit, but as the pressure got higher the deeper the applicator went, my mind started racing and I just couldn't go any further! Even when aroused I can't get my fingers past a certain point without it feeling grossly tight/pressurized.

I THINK I can have things in my vagina without explicit pain, but the discomfort is just unbearable when I try! I literally feel like I need SOMEONE ELSE to come and put a tampon in FOR ME! I just don't trust myself to not hurt myself. I'm in the process of getting treated for my intense anxiety, but so far the medications I've tried have given me bad side effects and I'm back on just counseling. 

What should I do? Should I try drinking a few glasses of wine before trying tampons again and see if that helps? Should I just keep getting pelvic exams done until it doesn't feel so gnarly to have things in my vagina?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/d02wii/when_exactly_does_penetration_of_any_kind_stop/,When exactly does penetration of any kind stop feeling so grueling?,,88,46,0.97,UncomfyCoochie
cuj95d,Healthyhooha,1566591276.0,"Hello everyone, 

I find it a little embarrassing, so I started a different account to post about this. Other than my mother, husband and daughter, most people in my life don‚Äôt know about this. I‚Äôm posting for my own support, but also because maybe it helps others.

I‚Äôm almost 50. A few years ago I developed a Lipoma on my Vulva. It started small but grew slow over time. My gynecologist was sure it was just a lipoma. So was my regular doctor. I had some tests for unrelated things and everyone who saw it said the same. But I was too fearful to have it removed.

But this year I was getting annoyed by how it looked. It was larger than a grape, smaller than a golf ball. It just bother me and made me self conscious. It was also starting to get irritated by my underwear or stretch pants. I occasionally had a little pain. I decided to have it removed.

Day 3:

I‚Äôm now three days post op. It was an outpatient procedure. The prep took longer than the surgery itself, but total I was only in the hospital about 3 hours. I was put under in a ‚Äútwilight‚Äù state and they also used a local anesthetic. I don‚Äôt remember anything. My husband said the surgery itself couldn‚Äôt have been more than 20-30 minutes.

Pain hasn‚Äôt been too awful. I‚Äôm allergic to most pain killers, but Tylenol has been enough. There‚Äôs no stitches, my surgeon used glue. Now I‚Äôm mostly sore and swollen. I can‚Äôt really wear underwear so I‚Äôm staying home in long nightshirts at least until next week. Heating pad on low in short durations helps. 

Keeping it clean because of the area seems the biggest challenge, but luckily I‚Äôve been able to shower each day. I also bought water wipes to gently pat clean every time I  go to the bathroom. I pat dry with just clean toilet paper.

I‚Äôm a little worried about scarring, I‚Äôll talk to my doctor next week about how to minimize it. 

My labia and vulva on the one side are still pretty swollen... I think the labia swelling contributes to the pain, but again it isn‚Äôt terrible. Maybe a 6 on a scale of 1-10. The incision is larger than I expected, but the lipoma was a good size. 

Anyone else have similar?  Anyone have vagina surgery of any kind and have tips for recovery? 

Feel free to ask me any questions.

Thanks for listening.

Edit:

Day 6

I had a little unexpected bleeding from the incision. I called and the doctor on call wasn‚Äôt too concerned. He said to keep and eye on it and come in tomorrow to see my surgeon and play it safe.

Later, lucky me, I got my period. What a hassle! I had planned the surgery so I‚Äôd have at least two weeks to heal before expecting my period, but it decided not to cooperate.

Not sure what to do, and after realizing there was no way I‚Äôd get my mentrual cup in (because of labia swelling), I called the doc again. Same guy on call. He wasn‚Äôt very patient and he was... not the most helpful. No offense, but he acted like an ignorant GUY. First he said to use pads but then agreed when I said that wouldn‚Äôt be so sanitary for the incision. Then he suggested the bleeding I had the night before might have been from my period and *was I sure* .... dude, I‚Äôve had my period over 35 years, I think I know the difference. He finally said to use Tampons. 

I‚Äôm playing it safe and sticking to small size, cotton organic ones that I‚Äôll change often. I‚Äôll see the actual surgeon tomorrow and confirm that‚Äôs ok. 

Sigh.

Day 12

Recovery is going way slower than I would like. It‚Äôs a little depressing.

Day 7 I went to doc. He said the incision opened up but it looked okay and would heal from the ‚Äúinside out‚Äù. Keep it clean, watch for infection, and put loose dressing on it to absorb fluid ‚Äúweeping‚Äù which is normal. He did congratulate me for not having cancer, which I thought was odd since no one really said that was a concern.

Day 10 and 11, which is into a holiday weekend, and I‚Äôm still mostly in bed. I still can‚Äôt really put underwear on. The incision is still open, but worse in the fact my labia all up on that side is super swollen, and hurts more than the incision. I tried hot compress but that made it worse so I‚Äôve been doing ice gel pack every few hours. As long as I‚Äôm laying in bed, I feel okay. Walking is just so uncomfortable. 

I was getting pretty bummed out. Even had a crying spell. I‚Äôm trying not to regret having the surgery. I really didn‚Äôt expect to be laid up so long. At all. Surgeon made it sound like nothing. My expectations were maybe a week I‚Äôd be in bed.

Husband wanted to cheer me up so he bought me a cutesy stuffed animal. He didn‚Äôt realize. He bought me a stuffed beaver. Bahahahahahahaha

At least today the swelling looks a little better. Everything feels maybe a little bit better so I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs going in a positive direction now.

Day 14

Things finally seem to be improving. The incision still looks pretty open, but it‚Äôs definitely better than it was and slowly closing. 

The labia swelling is finally subsiding too. There‚Äôs been small improvements each day. I‚Äôve been steadily doing ice pack every 4 hours for 20 minutes. I actually try to keep it more on the labia and less on the incision.

One thing though... the itching! Omg. I know itching of a surgical incision is common as the cells rebuild the skin, but god there are times it‚Äôs enough to drive me insane. Luckily it‚Äôs not constant. Keeping a loose soft sterile gauze over it sometimes helps. 

I am sick of not being able to put underwear or pants on, and living mostly in bed in nightshirts is getting old. I‚Äôm an out-and-about type, so I really hope for some better progress by next week.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/cuj95d/lipoma_on_vulva_experience/,Lipoma on Vulva - Experience,,82,36,0.98,booboohoohah

102faus,WomensHealth,1672770225.0,"Hi! I'm a 22 y.o living in Europe with a public health care system that is supposed to be crazy good because is free but is fucking ass and it takes ages to find a doctor that actually believes your symptoms and doesn't want to gaslight you or tell you that your extreme pain is normal and all you need is a goddamn ibuprofen. 
It has happened to me twice now. The first time the doctor told me all I had was anxiety... I changed doctors because I felt like I was dying and it turns out I had a stomach bacteria that was leaving me with no nutrients, of course the 1st doctor didn't think of this, just went straight into ""you have anxiety dummy, that's it"". She was wrong.

Now I'm under a different doctor, but she is currently out for holidays. So I went today as I have very bad period pains, lower back pain, pain when I have sex, pelvic pain, pain in my ovaries, ""butt-lightning"", loss of appetite, heavy bleeding and I pass large blood clots. I told all of this to this ""replacement"" doctor and also added the fact that EVERY single month for years, I pass a very large piece of tissue and she deadass said to me that ""No, that's imposible, all that falls out of your vagina is blood clots, no tissue. Also the pain is normal, take Ibuprofen."" 
Girl, be for fucking real.

I am genuinely so pissed off right now. Being gaslighted and not believed as a young woman by doctors is a way too common situation and I am extremely tired of them not listening to the PATIENTS that know HOW THEIR BODIES WORK. I'm not here for you to be standooffish, just for you to actually help me.

Also I have to add the fact that I have never been checked by a gynecologist and I am clearly in the age of doing so, and that's what I was expecting, an appointment with a gynecologist... not to be brushed off.

Sorry for the rant... my question is if anyone has similar symptoms and can help me figure out if what I'm having is normal or if it could be something else... also if anyone has had a similar experience with doctors because I feel so much rage right now ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞

ys7qhb,WomensHealth,1668166108.0,"Hello to the community! I recently learned of a huge problem in healthcare that most negatively affects women, and I would love to hear if you‚Äôve experienced it as well, or any tips and thoughts on the subject:

When I was 19 years old I walked into the office of the head of the spinal department at a leading hospital. I‚Äôd been suffering from debilitating chronic back pain to the point of not being able to function for 3 years prior, following a major spinal surgery when I was 16.

The doctor heard my story, and asked me to step out of the room so he could speak privately to my father, who had accompanied me. My father and I were both taken aback. I‚Äôm the patient, and I‚Äôm an adult. But I stepped out.

My father came out a few minutes later. ‚ÄòHe said there‚Äôs no physiological reason for your pain. That it‚Äôs in your head, and that you‚Äôre depressed‚Äô.

I was dumbstruck. By the cavalier misdiagnosis, by the stinging dismissal of pain that was completely wrecking my life, and by the disrespect of not discussing it with me directly.

I slowly walked to the car, barely able to stand from the pain, with the proverbial ‚Äòit‚Äôs in your head‚Äô writing off that women have been dealing with for centuries ringing in my ears. I felt helpless, scared and alone.

12 years and \~40 doctors later I am now completely pain free thanks, in part, to medical professionals who believed in me, and worked with me in partnership to help me overcome my pain.

I‚Äôve since often wondered how many other young women receive similar feedback. In retrospect I wish I had shared more about my journey earlier - maybe it could have helped others in knowing they‚Äôre not alone, that they should never accept dismissal or bias, and that there is hope.

I recently experienced another gross misdiagnosis of someone close to me, this time a cancer diagnosis with much more severe consequences. 

Following this I found myself waking up at night, wondering if these experiences were just a coincidence, or if there‚Äôs something that could be done differently. I did some research and what I learned shocked me to my core. 

I learned that medical dismissal, gaslighting and misdiagnosis is far from just my experience. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the biggest problems in healthcare.

That medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, following only cancer and heart disease.

That every year 40,000-80,000 Americans die from preventable diagnostic errors alone.

That when you walk into a Doctor‚Äôs office, 1 In 10 times you will be misdiagnosed. And if you have a serious medical condition, it‚Äôs 1 in 5 times.

I also learned that errors in diagnosis happen much more to women, people of color, members of the LGBTQ community, and people with emotional challenges.

That, for example, female-specific conditions such as endometriosis, often take 10 years or more to be diagnosed.

That women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed following a heart attack than men.

That women of color have 3.5 times the mortality rate of white women during and after pregnancy, similar to women in developing countries.

And that LGBTQ people are twice as likely than others to feel their provider dismissed their concerns or assumed something about them without asking.

The last thing I learned, and this is what shocked me the most, is that the healthcare system seems to view this as business as usual.

Imagine an airline where 10% of planes crash because of human error and bias. Now imagine that when that plane is filled with women or minority populations, it crashes even more. How long would this airline stay in business? Would we continue buying tickets for our parents and children?

Wouldn‚Äôt you think that these numbers would constitute a state of emergency and that fixing it would be the top priority?

Instead, this problem is often being swept under the rug.

I‚Äôve already come across hundreds of stories of people from all walks of life dismissed and misdiagnosed by the healthcare system.

**And we are all dealing with this alone, and aren‚Äôt learning enough from the experiences of others.**

This is why I decided to share my story and to offer those interested to create a space for learning about this problem and how we can combat bias in medicine, for sharing our stories, for supporting one another and for consulting with one another, in order to protect ourselves and our loved one‚Äôs when receiving healthcare.

I feel it‚Äôs up to us to change this reality. We need to come out and share our stories, until we can‚Äôt be ignored anymore. And we need to create supportive spaces where we can get advice, discuss what action we can take, and support one another before and after these experiences.

I've just posted the latest edition of my podcast What Your GP Doesn't Tell You on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/4t91rpNpUQMdzJixpJU79n)

It's called Why Does Medical Science Know So Little About the Female Body? I think this might of interest to this women's health group.

It turns out that most studies on human biology have been done on male humans, male animals and male cells. The assumption was made that women's bodies worked just like men's but there is more and more evidence that this is not the case at all. 

As a result, as Dr Janine Clayton, Director of the Office of Research for Women‚Äôs Health  at the US National Institutes of Health has commented: ‚Äúwe literally know less about every aspect of female biology compared to male biology‚Äù.

I cured a 9 month long yeast infection that was resistant to medication, and I thought I would share what ultimately worked in case anyone is going through the same. First, the things that failed: I tried fluconazole 6 different times, terconazole 3 times, coconut oil, monolaurin, probiotic suppositories for 2 months, oral probiotics, and fermented foods. None of that worked. I didn‚Äôt even attempt monistat because at that point, I knew it was a deeper-rooted issue. What DID work was a combination of: 

  
1. cutting all sugar (except for 1-2 fruit servings a day) out of my diet

2. taking saccharomyces boulardii once a day for 4 mos

3. inserting boric acid vaginal suppositories every day for 2 weeks then once a week for 4 weeks

&#x200B;

I discovered that the root cause of my candida was in my gut, hence, why my altering my diet and introducing saccharomyces boulardii worked. This candida was caused by antibiotics and then fed by fermented foods. Saccharomyces boulardii clear the candida from my gut first, without causing any other damage to my microbiome. After that, getting rid of the yeast (candida albicans) in the vagina became a lot easier. Boric acid lowers the PH of the vagina to a level that encourages good bacterial growth and discourages yeast growth. I still flare if I eat too much ice cream, but I will pop a boric acid suppository up my hooha and take 1-2 saccharomyces pills and I recover just fine.

I have a strong family history of breast cancer so I decided when I was 35 to get genetic testing. I found out that I hold the BRCA2 mutation and was never informed by anyone that I would no longer be able to get life insurance, disability insurance, or long-term care insurance because of this pre-existing condition. Insurance carriers are allowed to discriminate and the federal GINA law does not provide protections against this. It has come to my attention that Florida is the first state pioneering these protections. I have included the link from facing our risk of cancer and powered (FORCE) which details in layman's terms the legislation.

I‚Äôve been battling UTIs for the last four years. Several a year, each one worsening in intensity.

Last night, I went to the washroom around midnight and peed. Around 2am I went to the washroom again and passed out due to the amount of pain I was in. I was rushed to the hospital by ambulance and after 6 hours, was diagnosed with a kidney and bladder infection.

I‚Äôve been told by my GP and urologist that intercourse is what is causing the UTIs. I‚Äôve been told my only prevention option is to use low dose antibiotics every time I have sex. I have not been doing this as I am worried about the long term effects. However, last night was really scary. The only symptom I had was my urine smelled weird and then it escalated so quickly. The last UTI I had, I went to bed feeling some slight pain when urinating to peeing blood in the morning in excruciating pain.

I do it all. I shower after sex. I pee after sex. I use lube. I take iron supplements and cranberry supplements. My partner and I even started using condoms and I still fucking got one.

Is anyone using low dose antibiotics after sex? Have you found this to be helpful? Is there no other way to combat this?

- I am 33

- My partner and I have both been tested for Urea Plasma via urine tests by my GP

Hello all. I am at a loss for words right now and haven‚Äôt been able to even eat, just sleep all day because I can‚Äôt feel anything emotionally. I am an 18 year old demiboy (AFAB) and for the past 4 years have been dealing with horrible menstrual issues. 6 month long periods, soaking through overnight pads in 30 minutes, golf ball sized clots, pain. I saw a gyno 4 years ago who didn‚Äôt do any exams and just put me on birth control. The birth control was giving me high blood pressure so I started seeing my current nurse practitioner and she put me on nexplanon. She knows of my gender dysphoria, pain even when I‚Äôm not on my periods, I have pain almost every day. She sent me to a doctor to talk about laproscopy. That appointment was today. The doctor came in and when I told her of all my issues she said she wouldn‚Äôt be comfortable doing the lap because I could just get an IUD instead. I told her I want to have surgery because after being on BC for 4 years it makes me feel like shit, and even the nexplanon has made me feel like shit and made my migraines worse. I asked if she would be willing to do an ablation. She asked if I wanted kids. 
I replied with ‚ÄúI never even want to be sexually active, I have so much pain down there and dysphoria. I never want kids‚Äù she just said ‚ÄúI know you think you don‚Äôt want kids but I‚Äôd only do this treatment if you‚Äôre older‚Äù 
Why even ask ‚Äòdo you want kids‚Äô if you‚Äôre going to answer for me. 
She told that the IUD and painkillers everyday is the only treatment she‚Äôs willing to give me and then ended our appointment. 
I want to disappear, this was my only hope to live normally for a chance and it was crushed. I don‚Äôt want to be on hormones because it gives me horrible migraines and makes me moody. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I pursue surgery somewhere else? And if so, does anyone know LGBT friendly, AFAB, gynos in Vilnius Lithuania?

Hey so, I‚Äôm intersex and I‚Äôve got clitoromegaly. Because of this I‚Äôve always struggled with cleaning down there because I can‚Äôt find any information that caters to my vulva type. The closest I‚Äôve gotten is advice posts for FTM trans people, but they‚Äôre also hard to find and focus more on other aspects of bottom growth.

Whenever I masturbate, I end up with black/dark grey stuff under my nails/on my fingers. It doesn‚Äôt smell any different to the rest of my vagina/vulva. If I pull at my labia it‚Äôll also come off then, like I‚Äôm shedding or something. I‚Äôm black and unless I‚Äôm deliberately trying to scrape it off it‚Äôs not noticeable at all because it blends in with my skin tone. There are also greyish marks on my clit (under the hood) that won‚Äôt come off, I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs dirt or just my skin. I try to wash them off but they‚Äôre hard to get to because it‚Äôs hard to pull my clitoral hood back and expose my clit fully.

Is this smegma? Dead skin? I‚Äôve had this for several years now. I wash in the shower with warm water using a washcloth, and I‚Äôve tried to rinse anything off using the showerhead down there, but it always comes back the next day.

When my growth spurt ended in my early teens, I was 5' 11"". The average man in my country was 5' 6"". I'll save the whinging; you can imagine the problems I encountered. I took my situation to my Gran. She listened patiently, then took me to her back garden and pointed to her flowering lilac tree.

""What do you see first?"" she asked.

""The rose."" I said. 

""You are that rose,"" she said. ""When people see the sameness all about them, no matter the beauty, they will always search for the rose. There is more beauty in the rose than it's difference from the lilac. You will always be the rose, with its own special beauty and thorns no matter how much you try to be the lilac.""

I had to replace a broken tail light for a while and back in April I thought ""well fuck it, I'll order the part and if I can't do it then at least I won't get charged as much taking it in somewhere.""  

I live in an apartment complex in Texas (to give context) and at this point during the day it is hot as fuck, I'm gross from working on my car outside for half an hour and wearing an oversized shirt and exercise shorts, and if I wore make up that day I had already sweat it off. Some guy in the parking lot at least 15+ years older than me sees me trying to replace the light and runs over to help.  

To be fair, he was a mix of helpful and unhelpful. But I appreciated what he did and thanked him appropriately when we were done, and then he kept asking me what apartment I lived in. ""Uhh, building 1."" ""Yes but, which apartment number?"" several times. Finally I caved and told him but mentioned that my boyfriend lived there too. And I walk back to my place, feeling super uncomfortable, thinking ""why did he hit on me? I'm sweating like a glass of ice tea on a patio table in summer, wearing shapeless clothes, and probably smell not so great"" and then it dawned on me. He hit on me *because* of those reasons. I was more attainable at this point than if I had been freshly showered and dressed nicely and wore makeup. It was like a light bulb went off in my head.   

Something else of note is that he was scouting for me to need his help. When I started working on the light I realized I might need some other tools so went back upstairs to grab some. I noticed without thinking about it that he was hurrying through the parking lot in my direction. And then when I came back down he popped up a few minutes later.

I've had an IUD for about a year and a half now and it hasn't been the easiest ride for me. I had a hellacious time with my birth control from the symptoms I was having wrecking havoc on my life to my insurance refusing to pay for the pill that actually worked and it being 170$ a month. The IUD was the best option, it was free, and my  symptoms have been very lowkey, cramping, some spotting, etc. However, occasionally when I have sex I get an intense pain in my cervix and some bleeding/spotting for a couple hours after. This doesn't happen every time, only sometimes, and I figured it had something to do with the sensitivity of my cervix during my cycle. 

Fast forward to yesterday, I was feeling around for my IUD strings, and I found a large growth near my cervix. It felt like what I would describe a uterine polyp to feel, but near my cervix, almost like a piece of my cervix had come loose. It was quite large and soft. When I called my GYN they said that it was nothing to worry about and my IUD probably just became dislodged and to make an appt. to get checked out, but they can't see me for 5 days. And I can still somewhat feel my strings, they aren't missing, just blocked by this foreign body. I feel around for my strings about once a month and I had not noticed this before. Me and my partner had sex a little over a week ago, and he can usually feel my strings, says they were for sure there, and didn't notice any growth. Is this something that I should be worried about? I have been experiencing a lot of cramping and pain but haven't experienced pain or bleeding during sex in a couple of months, so it is weird to me that this has showed up now.

When we finished he told me he had sex with someone in the previous month. I didn‚Äôt think anything of it because I assumed he used a condom with them. 
A few days later, I got a yeast infection. I assumed it was from the condom because it was our first time using one. I was embarrassed to say anything because I didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd understand. So I asked him if we could use a different condom next time and he asked me why. I explained to him what happened and he appeared to be understanding and empathetic. 
Fast forward to 2wks later, my cycles comes. After my cycle ended, I didn‚Äôt have a yeast infection anymore. I didn‚Äôt have any itching, burning, smell, discharge, nothing. 
We ended up having unprotected sex the following week. A few days after, he tells me that he thinks he has a yeast infection cause he‚Äôs breaking out (I guess he meant itching). He accused me of ruining his life and told me he never wanted to speak to me again. He never gave me a chance to explain. A few days after that happened, I got another yeast infection. I was so confused cause I did not understand how I could be having a yeast infection and how I could‚Äôve given him one. 
I found out that my sister had bought Angel Soft‚Äôs scented tissues. These tissues are strongly fragrant but I couldn‚Äôt tell because my sister‚Äôs bathroom is always scented. Anyways, i was using that tissue after my cycle ended and I think that‚Äôs what triggered my 2nd yeast infection.

I‚Äôve tried every medical treatment for all three. I have changed a lot of my hygiene habits, like showering and peeing before and after sex, not using wet wipes, only using water and unscented soap, taking probiotics/boric acid/cranberry supplements, using cotton underwear or just not wearing underwear, no baths or swimming, always using condoms, having me and my partner wash our hands right before sex, etc. nothing has worked.

I don‚Äôt even want to have sex anymore because of the pain and the fact that I feel like having sex while having all these issues means I‚Äôm making the problem worse and bringing it on myself. My partner hasn‚Äôt been able to cum lately and says it might be the condoms (even though it hasn‚Äôt stopped them before), but I really don‚Äôt want to stop using them because I know it will make things worse.

At least the actual gyno doctor is pretty nice and respectful.

I feel hopeless and I feel like even if I do eventually cure the problem it will just come back and I‚Äôll be stuck in this cycle for the rest of my life.

The smell might actually be from the wet wipes i've been using. I noticed that they have this subtle smell similar to what i've been smelling.

I'll be looking for a different brand or option and see if that makes a difference. 

I also went to the gyno yesterday and did a checkup, everything seemed fine. She did a swab test and i'll be getting the results this coming week. Urine sample also came back clean so if there was a UTI it got flushed out or there was nothing at all.

Hello. For a few months or so i've been having this issue where after i poop the smell of feces seems to travel up to my Labia Majora and sometimes on the outside of my Labia Minora. However there's no abnormal discharge and there is no smell coming from inside my vagina.

I only wipe front to back, and i'm usually very careful specifically not to get any feces around my vagina. For a while i washed my taint immediately (we don't have a bidet so i would just go to the shower and quickly wash myself) with warm water, but the smell seemed to emanate around me also. It would go away after a while but it's not pleasant for me and i don't want other people to smell it of course. 

Recently i started wiping (again, only front to back and very carefully) using regular TP, followed by wet TP on and a little in my taint and, with a clean piece, a bit above my taint also, then drying everything up with a square of regular TP. The smell doesn't float around me anymore but when i open my legs i do feel a poop smell come from the front. When i wipe my finger on my Labia Majora there is definitely a smell of poop present. This smell doesn't seem to go away.

My partner, bless her, helped me today and she smelled it also and in the same areas, so at least i feel like i'm not insane. However this makes me very insecure so any sex has been off the table for a while. She supports me and doesn't mind, but i have some trauma about smelling bad due to the abuse i grew up with so this whole issue is not doing me any favours right now.

I don't use tampons or pads, only a disc and cotton period underwear. I don't remember ever having this issue before. I only had a yeast infection that i couldn't get treated for a while due to certain reasons, but it went away quickly after doing an OTC treatment. I did just develop a UTI but i suspect it is because of this issue. I just had a stomach bug and i had to poop more often than usual. I will be seeing a doctor about it soon and also have a gyno appointment soon. I thought i'd ask here since maybe you all have some more experience about this or could give me some pointers about what to ask the doctor or just what was your experience.

I am otherwise healthy and have been on the same birth control for about 20 years with no issues.

I‚Äôm pretty sure I will be looking for a different primary care physician who respects my autonomy.

ozal51,WomensHealth,1628268657.0,"Despite being the owner of a vagina, I know next to nothing about it. The basics, yeah, but regarding anything more in-depth? No. 

Within the past month, I experienced a mild grade 1 uterine prolapse due to the perfect storm of circumstances. I had some constipation. I went running with my dog. Then I needed to do some heavy lifting to help move a mattress. Then, bam. I felt a bulge in my vagina when putting in my new Nuvaring. Since then, it seems likes it receded back in position, but I've been pretty much obsessively checking my cervical position since. 

But I've come to realize... I don't even know where my cervix should be in the first place. And I only just realized that it can MOVE. 

I went to my doctor today and asked a few questions about it. I noticed that my cervix was pointing downwards, whereas usually it's pointed more backwards (pointing towards my colon). I guess this is because my uterus is retroverted but hell, I don't actually know. My doctor said it was normal for it to move and normal for it to sometimes point downwards. I trust her, but at the same time, I'm so unsure about everything. 

I have a referral for physical therapy for my pelvic floor, so at this point, I'm just waiting on a call. Not only that, but I've been taking it easy and trying to be kind to myself (I've felt very depressed since my prolapse, on top of my usual depression).

oqs62j,Healthyhooha,1627140419.0,"Hey everyone,

So I have been dealing with vulvar tearing for 3 years now. The tears are like small to large paper cuts all over my vulva: around my clit, on or around my inner labia minora, around my vaginal opening, on my labia majora all over and especially around yhe vagina opening, and on my perineum. 

This started happening after I had gotten and IUD for 8 months. I had constant heavy 2 week periods, every two weeks, for 8 months. So I got that piece of trash out! I went back on my usual birth control and then had to change twice and now I am back on the one I had been for years with no issue (Lo loestrin fe) for about 3 months now.

The Tears: They happen because of sex no matter how slow or how much lube my long time male partner and I use. We are both clean and have only ever been with each other. They also happen from even the smallest tug, maybe a slightly hard wipe every once in a blue moon (due to being in a rush) or spreading of my labia majora to see if I have more cuts. The cuts heal pretty quickly but they sting and hurt. I am so sick of it. 

What I Have Done: I have seen my OB/GYN and a dermatologist about these issues. One did a biopsy and another a swab (that biopsy hurt like a mofo!!) and found the area was irritated and that was it. No lichen sclerosus or anything like that. They had me change some things in my cleaning routine and my detergent. I was given steroids for a short while as well. Then also instructes to use hydrocortisone cream in case of irritation. I also got a bidet and now use menstrual cups. I only wear cotton panties and wash with the sensitive skin dove bar soap (per the dermatologist and gyno)  with lukewarm to warm water and it doesn't go into my vagina. I pat myself dry after a shower and let that area air out for about 10 to 20 minutes before putting on cotton underwear. I also have been using V Magic by Medicine Mama and it has really helped moisturize the area and if I ever have irritation from anything I aoply it after washing the area with soap and water and it really helps calm it down.

The steroids really helped and for the first time I had sex without tearing. But as soon as I stopped them it came back. I am at my wits end! I've just about accepted that I am gonna tear during sex and at other random times. I am ready to give up. 

Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? What did you do?

Extra Info: I also have 2 autoimmune diseases (RA and Lupus) that are managed by medications. My birth control is for my terrible periods I had as well as protection against getting pregnant. I have no STDs or STIs. I have had 3 bathrolin cysts, 2 of which turned into abscess and had to be surgincally drained as well as a staph infection that also had a cyst but that got treated as well. These were all back when I had my IUD and then right after it was taken out. I don't know if that has anything to do with but I figured I would include it just in case.

UPDATE:
I don't know how to post an update but my GYN prescribed me estrogen cream stating that he is glad I followed up. He said he is happy to prescribe it since I am right that we have exhausted other possibilities and just wants me to follow up in two months to ensure I am doing okay on it. ‚ò∫ I really hope this helps!

nzxbl1,Healthyhooha,1623705541.0,"This is driving me crazy and the only idea I'm getting so far is that I might be getting a bit of thrush around ovulation due to a spike in hormones.

It's not a fishlike smell at all and it's not so strong that it makes me gag but it just smells really...acidic and sour. Like a strange mix between bleach and vinegar. 

Although I've always naturally had a lot of discharge, I also seem to get a lot more discharge around this time and it's usually runny or quite tacky and sticky, but not thick and clumpy. Sometimes it looks white/pale yellow but as I've had thrush before it doesn't seem to resemble thrush discharge.

Funny thing is it only lasts for a few days or less than a week then everything goes back to normal. No weird smells or an abundance of runny discharge until what I estimate is the next month around ovulation.

I should also add:

1. The discharge itself isnt itchy but because I don't wear underwear to bed, I get so wet that I absent mindedly itch/wipe away at it in my sleep so the skin around my groin can get quite sore. This clears up after some pure aloe vera gel.

2. I haven't had any sexual contact in almost a year and always wash my hands before I touch down there, ANY sex I've had in the past has always always been done using a condom and partner washes their hands/everywhere else beforehand

3. I do use Dove sensitive bar soap on my vulva-nowhere near my vagina though. I'm going to try using just water to see if anything changes.

I've had a blocked (maybe infected but never painful) Bartholin's gland on the right side for the last 10 years. Sometimes it's larger than other times. Usually size between blueberry and large grape, sometimes a bit bigger. It's uncomfortable and definitely something is wrong with it. Left side is not noticeable at all.

One doctor told me 10 yrs ago that yes it was swollen but that it might be safer to leave it alone unless it becomes seriously infected, which I would know by the pain. One doctor a few years ago said it was normal but she was an idiot and I don't think really knew that much about them. I tried to explain that it gets much larger and is very noticeable and uncomfortable after sex/masturbation but she dismissed me.

Yes, I've tried the Phoebe method, warm compresses, hot baths, silica, serrapeptase, etc but nothing has ever made a difference. Someone's it's less worse.

What I don't wasn't are the obligatory ""see a doctor"" messages. Understand and appreciate the intent but that's not helpful at the moment.

I ask because I recently got a clit pump and the thought occurred to me that perhaps I could unclog the clogged hole in the gland which releases lubrication fluid with the pump. It's a hand pump with small cylinders, if that makes a difference.

Gyno saw no signs of external urethral damage, but I don't feel right. My pee is going everywhere, it still hurts when I pee. I was put on cipro antibiotics but no change.

1. What followed next? I'm trying to figure out if I'm just being overly anxious or if I really have done permanent damage to myself. Did you just wait it out and it got better over time?

3. Did you get PTSD from it? I am an absolute wreck and can't stop beating myself up for making this mistake. I keep replaying the entire incident in my head.

**How it works:**

* I've made a [screen recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I9aaumg5k9JKwjjSSDAEwQwfSfDIckll/view?usp=sharing) of me walking through the prototype - so feel free to pause on any screens to get a closer look at the design
* I set up a [collaborative board on Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lvtfKK8=/?invite_link_id=122517720197) (tool that helps remote teams brainstorm) and created a section that says ""FEEDBACK HERE"" which includes a link to the screen recording and a place with sticky notes to add your feedback. You may need to zoom in or out to find the board, but I put it in huge letters so you could see it.
* Feel free to explore the rest of the board with all my research (*but please don't move anything around*). You all helped contribute to this.

**Some notes:**

* This is just a prototype, so not all sections are fleshed out, but I tried to include enough so that you get the idea of how this app works

I don't strictly feel that way as much anymore, and my bf has no problem with the set-up/rules surrounding anal in order to make sure we're both happy (in fact he's really sweet and makes anal just as intimate/loving as PIV), but I still feel like I don't belong, and that I can never relate to anyone on this.

I just love being commando but...time and place. üôÑ anyways after that bike ride I felt chafing on my labia minora. It was itchy and looked a little bit more purple than before and not as smooth. Just irritated.  It was itchy when it was dry. Like after I wiped. Didn‚Äôt really itch otherwise. No itching or irritation on the inside. I used diaper rash cream to soothe it but it didn‚Äôt really go away. My discharge was more watery at this point. Sex was painful at the entrance but the inside of my vagina was feeling fine. And after sex it was swollen and uncomfortable. There was no visible bumps or really any other symptoms. So I ruled out yeast infection? And just assumed it was chafing from the biking and that it would go away. BOY WAS I WRONG. So things continue on like that for like two weeks and I start feeling ...normal? But then I had sex and it was hurting on the outside again, swelling up after, and just feeling like someone punched me on my vagina afterwards. So I was like oh this is still here. Still no visible symptoms ON the vagina. So week three - itching worsened, my vagina started getting extremely dry, one time my clit got little cuts on it. Discharge was thicker and more frequent. I was like wtf. Then I get my period.

Yes. Yes. Yes. Every time, yes.

I‚Äôve been on the forums, like this one. I‚Äôve done the crazy Candida diet (no sugar!). I‚Äôve tried different antifungals. It keeps coming back, though

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ever been this bad. It‚Äôs been over a month now. The pain, the burning. So much pain, the idea of sex is revolting to me.

Today, the Dr. prescribed 7 days straight of Fluconazole. Great. Let‚Äôs try it.

Waited 2h1/2 at the pharmacy ‚Äì they wouldn‚Äôt give me the prescription unless the Dr could confirm I wasn‚Äôt pregnant ‚Äì Dr who wasn‚Äôt picking up on the other end of the line. It‚Äôs Friday. He‚Äôs probably gone. They probably won‚Äôt get an answer before Monday. No antifungals for me this weekend.

I crawled into in my car and cried. Big wet sloppy tears. Sure, I‚Äôm not dying, but it‚Äôs gotten to a point now where I am emotionally drained by this issue. I‚Äôm just sick and tired of feeling like there‚Äôs no solution and like I‚Äôm powerless.

I think this is honestly the worst part of vaginal issues; it‚Äôs such an intimate/delicate area that normally brings so much pleasure. (When I‚Äôm good down there, I am horny AF) ‚Äì having any kind of infections/diseases is like taking away a portion of your happy place. (Am I right? Or exaggerating?)

That‚Äôs it. Advice is more than welcome; so is emotional support. I love this community so far and appreciate everyone who‚Äôs shared their knowledge as of yet!

rcimc0,WomensHealth,1639059545.0,"This might be a ‚Äúwell duh‚Äù moment, but I decided to get off of birth control because I was getting to a breaking point with my mental health. In the past month I have had no mental fog, my memory is coming back, and I have WAY more autonomy over my emotions.

I was on the pill for a little less than 4 years and the first year or so there didn‚Äôt really seem to be any changes so I thought I was one of the lucky ones that didn‚Äôt experience any side effects. Wrong.

Emotions/Mental: 

Background: I‚Äôm more of a feel with your head not with your heart person. Meaning I can feel hurt, sad, excited, etc. but I can usually talk myself out of reacting based off of those feelings and respond more appropriately. All of that went out the window with bc. 

Then: I started struggling with serious depression about a year after I started bc but thought it was due to wedding stress, family/friend drama, and financial strain. I also had a toxic work environment and then COVID hit. All things that reasonably would have attributed to anxiety and depression. However, when things got much better, my depression remained. I usually had about a few weeks where things were ‚Äúgood‚Äù and then I would start to spiral. Friendships were the main trigger and I thought I could ‚Äúself treat‚Äù by socializing a few times a month. Eventually, that either did nothing or made things worse and it got to the point where I thought I needed therapy and medication. A big wake up call was when I ran my first half marathon about a little over a month ago. I was injured so my pace was a lot slower than I had been running in training. Instead of recognizing that, I cried during the majority of the race because I was disappointed in myself for not being better. I didn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúokay‚Äù about the race until the next day and never felt ‚Äúgood‚Äù about it or the fact that I did a couch to half marathon in 4 months.


Now: I feel so much lighter and way more in control of my emotions. I have a shit ton of anxiety but it‚Äôs not really affecting me day to day because my rational side walks me through it. It‚Äôs hard to explain but mostly a general sense of being nervous? 
A few days after getting off the pill, I suddenly had the desire to workout after months of not wanting to do anything. I did a HIIT workout but had to stop jumping because my injury wasn‚Äôt fully healed. It was night and day difference because I wasn‚Äôt upset that I had to modify, I was just happy to move and I told my husband probably 10 times that day that I was so happy I did the workout. I have yet to be frustrated/sad about anything I‚Äôm doing and that was an issue I was having almost every time since I started training in the summer.

Memory: 
Before: it didn‚Äôt matter if I was up for hours or just rolled out of bed, when I got to work I legit could not think/process. I could not remember anything I had done that morning and I would constantly think ‚Äúwow. What happened to me? This is not who I used to be.‚Äù But chalked it up to getting older. (Almost 30). I also could not remember conversations or items discussed the previous day or week.

Now: memory is coming back! I can answer questions because I KNOW the answers and I don‚Äôt have to go back to my notes. My recall has significantly improved and I can listen to someone without spacing out (also thought I might have ADHD). 

I started tracking when I notice emotional changes and I‚Äôm still considering therapy but life is a lot less out of control. I‚Äôm not triggered by that frenemy or constantly worrying that I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and people don‚Äôt like hanging out with me for too long. Because I‚Äôve been in this cycle for so long, I‚Äôm keeping track of my emotions and not just assuming that everything is going to be okay now. However, I do feel like my emotional endurance was cut in half and now I can process and handle a lot more like I used to.

TLDR: BC gave me serious depression, memory issues/brain fog.

My pap smear last week showed that my IUD strings have gone MIA, and the ultrasound did not help to find them but confirmed that the IUD is still in place. I am about due to have it replaced anyway.

However, my mental health has been in a right state and I truly SHUDDER at the thought of them fishing around for the old IUD considering how painful it was to have it placed 6 years ago.

I made the mistake of checking in Reddit for people's stories. It's all horror stories of how the pain was unbearable and the worst pain they've ever experienced. I'm not undermining their experiences, but mine was not like that.

On a pain scale it was 4/10, and it was no where near as bad as I thought.  It was more uncomfortable than it was painful if I'm being honest. As someone who gets bad period cramps that require a hot water bottle, the insertion felt the same. Just one bad cramp. The pain was more of an intense pressure, like someone squeezing your uterus. 

I was expecting a stabbing pain that would blind me. Nope. It wasn't like that at all for me. I straight up looked at the doctor and said ""wait? Is that it? Are we done?"". I was so surprised by how quick and easy it was. Why did I wait soo long?

I got my IUD inserted yesterday, and today I have some cramping. Is the cramping uncomfortable, yes. Is it bad? No. I even managed to go furniture shopping earlier today with no issues. I did take an advil extra strength, but I usually do on my period when the cramps are bad.

j0etvi,WomensHealth,1601157671.0,"So I was scrolling through Reddit this AM and read 2 posts about period underwear, so I thought it was a sign to share my first and most horrendous experience with period underwear.

I was in college trying out Thinx for the first time. I believe it was my first or second day so it was a pretty heavy flow. I was self-conscious most of the day but thankfully nothing had happened. It wasn't until near the end of the day when I had about an hour break to spare before my next class so I headed to the gym. This is where it went wrong. I started my leg stretches, and I guess it was in pigeon pose that my undies had displaced in a way where the edges of it were closer to where the \~ flow \~ was happening.

It wasn't until I was sitting on some machine that I had realized I was leaking. I ran to the bathroom and found that the blood had made its way *around* the panties. I thought okay, it's not that bad. I cleaned it up as best as I could and thought I would keep with it and not change into my spare non-period undies + pad I had. I only had one class left to go anyway, so it'll probably be fine. **Wrong**. As I sat through the class, I was feeling uncomfortable but thought it was just my paranoia from trying period panties for the first time + the leak that happened earlier. So I just did a casual check by brushing my hand against my butt. My god. The moment I reached my butt, I immediately started panicking. It was *soaking.* I could feel my fingertips had a more-than-okay amount of blood on them and I started panicking even more because I was sitting in front of the class. I started thinking of a game plan-- what was I going to do about the bloody fucking chair?? How am I going to make it out of this class without the students and the teacher noticing my pants AND the bloody chair?!? For the rest of the class, I sat on my hand to create some room between the chair and my pants. When class ended, I started rapidly trying to wipe the blood away with my fucking hands and ended up with some smeared concoction until I couldn't do anything more and said *fuck it.* I tied my sweater around my waist and ran to the bathroom to check the damage.

Jfc. It was practically everywhere. The blood had followed the path that the earlier leak had forged so blood *kept going around* the panties and spilling onto my pants.

I texted my friend (found the messages just for this story), ""Oh my god help please something it's leakomg so bad It's really bad I got it all over my seat OMGG omfg"". The rest of it goes with a lot of omgs until thankfully two of my friends show up in front of the stall I'm trapped in with sweats that were on sale from our college bookstore. I change into some fresh undies, put on a regular ol' pad and these new sweats. And that wraps up my period horror story.

FYI, the main reason I wanted to give Thinx panties a go is because I've always had a pretty tough time with leaking. So thinking back on this story, it's almost humorous how I leaked through leak-proof underwear. I also still use them btw- I think the undies work great, this was just a very unfortunate mishap lol.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/j0etvi/my_period_underwear_horror_story/,My period underwear horror story,,80,20,0.98,juicethrone

I suffered from debilitating vaginal symptoms and pain. This led to me feeling like my life was over and severely depressed. I thought that I was destined to live a life with an upset vagina forever, and somehow, after 15 years on and off, I am cured!

LINKS TO BEFORE AND AFTER IN COMMENTS

Don't give up hope. If I was able to cure myself, anyone can. That's how bad I was.

I also had m. hominis and GBS before taking the Evvy test and these cleared with antibiotics.

To get from the first result to the second I started a low-carb diet and eating healthy, and did strength exercises almost every day for 20 minutes.

Starting Jan 1, 2023: I used boric acid for 3 nights. Then I made vitamin C / coconut oil suppositories at home in a mini ice tray and put one of those in with an ozone oil suppository for 7 nights. After this, I used jarrow dophilus women's probiotics in my vagina for 7 nights. I emptied the powder in a small bowl with a drop of water and inserted it with a clean finger nightly. I also took probiotics orally by garden of life and used lactoferrin for a month. I stopped all treatments in early January for the most part. I only used a couple of probiotics here and there since then. However, before I took the most recent Evvy test I did not do anything to my vagina for over two weeks to make sure everything cleared out. Although, I did have sex with insemination about 5 days before. The crazy thing is that my husband tested positive for enterococcus faecalis at the end of Dec. and this was one of the bacteria that I had in my first bad Evvy test. I assume he probably still has it since he has not treated it. So apparently my vagina is actually able to fight this off on its own now which I find fascinating.

You don't have to follow my exact protocol, but you do need to make sure you break down the biofim, kill everything in the vagina, and then replenish with good lactobacillus. I never did the last step in the past and so that's why I kept getting reinfected. Also, until you build up the good bacteria you should not be having intercourse since that will keep adding bad bacteria to the vagina. I know it's hard, but it's worth it!

Once your vagina is healthy, it is capable of fighting off bad bacteria and rebounding after a period, or insemination.

I deeply empathise with any woman going through¬† this very trying ordeal. I know what its like to dislike certain parts of yourself because you feel broken and are unable to figure out a cure and when mainstream medicine seems to be making matters worse.
DISCLAIMER: I am no medical expert of any kind but what Im about to share below worked for me and I hope to help someone or at the very least provide some hope that all is not lost.
I am not affiliated to any brands mentioned in this post..they are simply what worked for me. 

Like many of you, I battled with months and months of recurrent bv to the point where I was beginning to worry about long term impact. I even forgot what the normal characteristics¬† of my discharge was. Honestly, I had tried so much I was beginning to give up.¬† My solution started when it was time for my yearly check up. My doctor performed a comprehensive check up and found that I¬† had a UTI. 
I was put on antibiotics¬† to clear that. It also cleared the bv symptoms...they returned a week afterü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
""Solutions"" I tried
- Boric acid suppositories 
- high amounts of probiotics 
- probiotic suppositories 
- hydrogen peroxide rinses

I used some of these treatments individually but mostly in combination with each other. Each treatment seemed like it was working for a few days....then stopped completely. The treatment that had the most potential was boric acid but the symptoms returned each time I tried to stop using them and I didn't feel right about using it for an extended period.
Lurking here and other bv threads helped me finally combine certain practices that cleared the issue completely.
My weapons of choice
- a relatively healthy lifestyle
- probiotics 
- pure cranberry juice or gummies 
- a douche bottle(hear me out)
- feminine ph test strips I use the one from nutrablast but I'm sure any good brand would work fine
- good clean love restore moisturising vagina gel (green box) 

To begin with, please make sure you're living a relatively healthy lifestyle, doing some moderate exercise, eating well and hydrating. Apple cider vinegar, yoghurt, cranberry juice, chlorophyll... based on your own research, what ever you chose to add to your lifestyle to promote gut and vaginal health. I have read in several places that a disruption of the gut microbiome leds to a general disruption in the body 

Secondly, I realised that the clumpy, goopy nature of bv discharge makes it hard for all of it to flow out of the vaginal cavity. Due to the different shapes and contours of each woman's cavity, these clumps can get stuck¬† and accumulate in certain ""corners"". This is what I believe leads to the worsening of the smell during sex as some ladies have reported... esp if your partner's equipment can reach all the way into you, sex can dislodge some of the clumps that u didn't even know were there and lead to the enhanced ""stench"". For those ttc, I believe the clumpy discharge makes it even more difficult for sperm to make their way through the vaginal canal through the cervix. The accumulation of this discharge also makes it harder for any topical solutions to work effectively and treatments would take more time.
My solution to this was to fill my douche bottle with filtered water and two probiotic capsules ...any good brand would do. break the capsule and pour into the bottle shake vigorously and ""douche"" with the sole purpose of getting accumulated discharge out with the added benefit of delivering¬† some probiotics to the vaginal canal. After this, apply the good clean love gel as per instructions on the box. This would help re moisturise your vagina and balance your ph. I believe its the action of the lactic acid...I don't know if any other brands of lactic acid gel would work as effectively good clean love gel worked for mebut you're welcome to try others. I decided to try it because I saw a pregnant woman here on reddit say her obgyn recommended it to control bv during her pregnancy...I did some reading and didn't find any ingredient that is potentially harmful to pregnancy but PLEASEE check with your doctor!!!
it may also be a good idea to abstain for a few days to give your vagina¬† a break. 
I used the ph strips morning and evening to check if my ph level was improving. The brand I bought had a guide to show you what to look out for...again please feel free to try others. I did the ""douche"" once for two days and haven't done it since. Within two days of using the gel, I began to see an improvement and in a week, my symptoms were completely cleared. You can imagine the joy I felt seeing and smelling( sorry, tmi...lol) regular discharge after months of torture. After about 10 days of consistent use, I started using it every other day, and now I use half the¬† recommended amount every couple of days or anytime I have been exposed to a trigger for maintenance. My symptoms have not returned in two months and I know I will be able to stop using it completely soon... I'm just being careful. I intend to always have a tube on hand though just in case I see any strange signs. But as far as I know, I'm bv free,¬† my confidence has returned and I dnt walk around so self conscious anymore. 

Before I end:
- my partner spoke to the doctor too about any treatments he could take while I was treating myself to avoid reinfection
- the cranberry was to help prevent the uti from returning 
- I'm using the probiotics to repopulate my gut after the antibiotics and also to fix whatever imbalances may exist there.
- wash your underwear with HOT water and dry them in the sun if you can...otherwise hot water alone will do
- use a liner with the gel or be sure to carry extra panties around
- be sure not to use any scented soaps around your vagina 
- keep testing your ph to be sure everything is under control. Urine has a different ph and can sometimes lead to a false ph reading if you pee before testing. Find a way to test before you pee...lol
- do whatever you can to maintain good vaginal health. Ph balancing wipes for when you pee outside ur home...remember to dry before you wear ur underwear though, changing your panties or liners as soon as they are wet, buying new lingerie after the bv episode is over, pap smears...whatever it takes.

ks50es,WomensHealth,1609991597.0,"Hi all.

I just want to share something I haven't heard talked about very much- how hormonal birth control affects women with pre-existing mental health disorders. 

I've always had depression (thanks, mom) + some anxiety, but all manageable with making sure I'm taking care of myself. I wanted to start taking the pill about 7 years ago at the age of 20 for all the positive things I had heard about it- and I was sexually active with my partner and wasn't ready for a pregnancy.

I have no idea how I got through the year I was on hormonal birth control. I had panic attacks so often I'd call them ""regular."" I would go into uncontrollable sobbing fits. I had rushes of anger and fear that were beyond anything I'd experienced before, all brought about by pretty standard daily stimuli. I had trouble playing some video games and watching TV with any difficult content. My life was hell. I thought I was losing my mind. I thought it was permanent. My time with hormonal birth control ended when I had a thought about driving my car off the road into a ditch. I was never prone to suicidal thoughts. I quit my pack cold-turkey that day. (I don't recommend that. Talk to your doctor first if you want to quit.)

Fast-forward to now, when I have had to take emergency birth control twice in a couple months due to condoms slipping. My anxiety and panic attacks have returned full-force. These things had been under control for years. The reason I KNOW it's from the hormones is that the anxiety feels SO bodily and it comes from absolutely nowhere. I'm just counting the days until my cycle is over and the hormones dissipate completely.

I'm sharing this because when I asked my OBGYN about the pill affecting depression and anxiety she told me ""it will likely help."" She didn't outline any possible risks. It's infuriating to think about now. Please, if you have a pre-existing mental health condition, talk to your OBGYN or doctor before starting the pill. There hasn't been a lot of study of this relationship but please ask them to tell you all they know, and monitor your moods after starting.  I wouldn't wish what I've been feeling on anyone.

A few months ago, we were inches from losing our home, with only one working vehicle and one job between the two of us. It was only by the good graces of our family members that we weren't swept below the sea--and now, finally, my fiance is back to work, we have another vehicle, and we are slowly but steadily getting back on track.


Today, I found out I'm pregnant--at least, according to the cheap dollar store test I took. By my estimate, I'm roughly 4-5 weeks along. We have a 1 year-old already, a beautiful and perfect little boy who incites squeals of delight out of nearly every woman who passes him by--""Oh my, look at those *cheeks*!!"" ""He looks like a little gentleman!"" ""He is just about the cutest thing I've ever seen!"" 


I love my son--ferociously, with every fiber of my being, and to my absolute delight, he's a hardcore Momma's boy; every time I walk in the room, even if I've only been gone a second to get a glass of water, he makes happy sounds and walks/crawls towards me as fast as he can, and hugs me so tight, smiling and laughing, and when I laugh back because he's so stinking sweet and adorable, he hugs me even tighter. He is truly, sincerely, the light and love of my entire life. I would love for him to have a sibling, he gets so excited around other babies and kids--I know he would be good big brother. 


But god, I'm conflicted. My fiance is adamant that we not go through with this pregnancy. He says it's bad timing, we can't afford it right now, and he's right. I know he's right. Logically, I agree with him; emotionally, I can't make the leap. 


I've spent a lot of time arguing with my forced-birther family members about a woman's right to choose, it's something I ardently believe in--but it doesn't make my personal decision any less difficult. My heart keeps telling me, *""We're getting on track, everything will work out, wouldn't you love to have another baby, a child, a person to love forever?""* But, at the same time, when I really sit with the idea of another pregnancy, another baby, a mouth to feed when my fiance and I are living off Ramen and 59-cent boxes of macaroni and cheese in order to afford food and diapers for our first child, I feel a real sense of quiet dread building in my stomach. The worst part is, we can't even *afford* the abortion--$550 out of pocket, according to PP, since my insurance won't cover it. Even if we can scramble to get the money, we still owe rent, bills, and *have a kid to feed* in the meantime. We can't afford either of the roads we face, at least not right now--to have a baby, or not to. 


I'm heartbroken, and lost, and scared. I feel like if I choose not to terminate, my fiance will resent me, eventually buckle under the stress and leave, and then both my kids will be without a father; but if I do terminate, I don't know how I'll get over it, or if I'll ever recover. Logically, I know the smart thing to do is to terminate. I get that. But my heart is holding out hope that we can make this work, that we'll all be okay, and that this will be a good thing for all of us, in the end. But I don't know if hope outweighs logic in this situation--I don't think hope is enough this time.

I then ask for an exam he says he will only do a pelvic exam bc I‚Äôm a virgin but my insurance only allows for one free women‚Äôs appointment a year and I‚Äôm only 20 so I wanted to make sure everything looked good but he refused.

When he did my upper exam he was silent and just left me, he said ‚Äúany questions‚Äù which i said no bc I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to ask in these visits and thought he would tell me something but he just left. Not even see you soon or hope everything goes well, nothing 

He didn‚Äôt tell me anything no side effects, didn‚Äôt assure me or anything nothing

My husband and kids were out of state so I duck taped a rag around my hand and drove myself 40 minutes to the ER. I sat there waiting for about 5 hours in the waiting room. They finally called me back and gave me a shot of lidocaine in my wrist. It didn't numb far enough to my thumb so they injected it straight into the cut. He looked inside it for like 30 seconds and said ""good news is you didn't cut a tendon"". Gave me 3 stitches, a tetanus shot, and sent me home. No other testing or imaging done. I went to urgent care to have the stitches removed on day 10. I had so many other things going on that I ignored it and went on with my life. There wasn't much strength in my thumb and limited movement. I figured it was just healing and I needed to strengthen it. After weeks of it not getting better I finally broke down and went to my PCP ( medical PTSD). Got a referral for an orthopedic surgeon. I saw him last week.

 I was told I severed a tendon in my thumb. They normally like to go in and repair it within days of the injury. Because it's been a few months my tendon retracted into my arm and my muscles contracted making the tendon too short and they cannot use it. They would have to do a tendon transfer surgery which means they would take 1 of the 2 tendons in the index finger and sew it into the bone in my thumb and attach it to the end part of the tendon in my thumb. I was looking at 4 weeks minimum in a brace without being able to use my left hand at all then another 6 weeks of rehab.

 Surgery was this Thursday morning. They started with blocking  (doing a type of epidural) in my shoulder which completely numbed and immobilized my entire left arm. It's completely dead weight. It's so weird. They said it could last about 36 hours and I should get the feeling and movement back. It was a phantom limb. I could feel my mind sending the signals to my hand and can feel them move even when they don't actually move. They put me under anesthesia. When I woke up the doctor said my severed tendon was still in my wrist and it was just blocked off by scar tissue. They removed the tissue and reattached the tendon. Now I'm looking at 2 weeks completely restricted in a cast and will start rehab after that which means being able to get my grooming shop up and running again! I got really lucky despite ignoring my injury. Don't ignore stuff like this! Get it checked out even if you think it's not important.

j6tpk1,TwoXSupport,1602087053.0,"**TW: depression, anxiety, toxic work environment** 

Hi everyone! I know this seems like a rhetorical question and it kind of is. I just need to vent about my struggles at work.

So I've worked at several places, mostly in restaurants and caf√©s. I enjoy working but there has always been a problem: I can't be open about my mental health problems. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder and I'm taking my daily antidepressants. However, there are sometimes days where I can't work. Or when I am at work and I need a few minutes to relax or to overcome a panic attack. My therapist has always been clear about me needing to be honest about my mental illness. That is because, in the beginning, I always lied about it. When I had a date with friends and I didn't feel like it, I always made up excuses why I couldn't come (rational excuses like work, headache, family problems etc.). The same at work. It took me really long to get there but I started to tell the truth eventually.

With my friends-no problem! At work...big deal. Suddenly I get treated differently. I can feel that my coworkers talk about me (and that's not just my anxiety speaking). I can feel that my bosses suddenly don't want me working for them anymore. The worst experience was a boss telling me: ""depression is just a fancy word for laziness. And I can't have laziness here."". I quit the next day because how am I supposed to feel safe and give my best in an environment like that?

Just to clarify: I am not calling every day and tell them I'm not coming. I am treating everyone at work nicely, including coworkers and guests. I am a great waitress, I am friendly, I am organized and I am focused. I can work. But sometimes I feel down, sometimes I have to take two days off to get in touch with my feelings and my needs. But somehow, this is not acceptable. If I had the flu however-no problem!

I am just sick of people treating me like I am lazy; like I chose to be depressed every few months.

k5ucs4,WomensHealth,1606988997.0,"I wanted to write this post as Reddit really helped me during a difficult time and to encourage women to be more pushy with doctors when they know something is wrong! A few months ago, I started feeling bloated everyday, it got to the stage where I had to undo all my pants and was very uncomfortable. The bloating was in the pelvic area and it was like a ring of bloating around my body including lower back and front. After a couple of weeks I went to Dr and he told me I was constipated and gave me a supplement for constipation. After a another couple of weeks nothing changed, I went back and he ordered some blood tests, they all came back ok, so I was diagnosed with IBS and told I needed to 'figure out the psychology of my stomach!' Another week or two went by and the bloating got worse, I started a fodmap diet but nothing changed. I couldn't go into work any more and started working from home. I went back a third time and was told I had a UTI and given antibiotics. I've had UTI's before and knew that this was different, so I pushed for further tests and was given an ultrasound referral. 2 weeks later the ultrasound (external and intravaginal) showed up a 5.5cm cystic / solid tumor arising from the left ovary. The report stated that it was a complex cyst and differential diagnosis included dermoid ( benign) or Cystic Neoplasm. 
The dr told me that I needed to prepare myself for something nasty. I demanded blood tests for ca125 and reluctantly the dr agreed and I left crying. I spent the next few days planning my funeral! I was unable to get in with a specialist in my home area for 3 months and was very uncomfortable and scared.
The CA125 blood test came back very low, but I knew this wasn't a guarantee.  Luckily I was able to get appointment and surgery scheduled in a capital city 2 hours away as a private patient. Whilst I was waiting a week to see the specialist, my dr called back and said that I had tested positive to the celliac gene in some earlier blood tests and suggested that I start a gluten free diet immediately. Again after 10 days nothing changed, but I continued with gf diet in case the cyst & gluten were both playing a part. It got to the stage where I couldn't eat any more and anytime I tried to eat a tiny bit, I would feel like there was a knot in my stomach and I wouldn't feel hunger much at all. Each week my symtoms got worse and worse. I couldn't go out of the house as I had no clothes that fit me any more and I looked 6 months pregnant. The fatigue crept up and I was exhausted most days by noon. 

I was booked in for a laparoscopy surgery and signed consent for the ovary to be taken if it couldn't be saved. The day of the surgery I was scared & due to Covid nobody could come with me. My surgery was later in the afternoon so I developed a bad migraine from dehydration. The hospital & nursing staff were fantastic, I found it very confronting that I had to walk into the operating theatre and climb up onto the operating table, I had tears rolling out of my eyes and the nurses holding my hand. The next thing I remember was waking up in recovery. I had pain in my pelvic area and four incision points. I was given morphine and after eating was able to get dressed. After the surgery I had heavy bleeding. I learnt that the cyst had grown quite significantly in the 7 weeks since the ultrasound and due to its size the ovary and tube were taken and bagged. The surgeon was unable to investigate the cyst but advised that he checked my stomach for fluid and there were no fluids, and that my bladder and kidneys all looked good. I took painkillers constantly for 2 days as it was very uncomfortable sitting and getting up and down. You have to learn to sleep on your back for first few days. Getting up involves rolling on to your side and pushing yourself up. 
By day 3 I was able to tolerate discomfort and walk around slowly. I was constipated for a day and going to the toilet was a bit uncomfortable for first 2 days. 
I was told that laparoscopy surgery can cause bad shoulder pain as the gas used in surgery can irritate the nerves in your shoulders, but luckily I didn't experience this. On day 5 I got the stitches out and was able to drove 2 hours home. The waiting for the biopsy results of the cyst was really challenging, I played out every scenario in my head and struggled with it a lot. I got my results back today and it was in fact a dermoid and benign. Today is day 6 and im still quite tired, swollen and bloated but I am getting better each day. I am grateful that it was benign. 

My message to ladies is that if you know something is wrong and feel like you are being fobbed off or not being taken seriously,  be pushy! You know your body  best and quite often ovarian symtoms are not considered. The symtoms of a cyst and ovarian cancer are very similar so its hard to distinguish one from another.

imm81k,TwoXSupport,1599246595.0,"TRIGGER WARNING STREET HARASSMENT, ABUSE AND POLICE ABUSE (also this post is kinda long so thanks for reading)

I have other mental health problems like schizophrenia and CPTSD (both diagnosed) that lead to me being sensitive and paranoid but I have just had enough.

I love going outside. I have always used walking and swimming at natural bodies of water to alleviate stress and get exercise. In the last year though I have become increasingly paranoid and afraid to leave the house because men constantly bother and harass me. I planned all week to go to the beach today because it's beautiful out but I'm scared to leave because when I get to the beach I'll be in a swimsuit and I don't want someone to use that as a reason to talk to me.

The police don't help either. I have gone to the police about violent assaults, stalking, you name it. I do my best to collect evidence but they never help. They have never helped me actually feel safe from threats. I also don't want to talk to some 50 year old dude about my experiences as a woman because police are usually disrespectful and dismissive. That is just my experience as a white woman and I'm not going to negotiate or talk about it further.

There's a guy who lives in my neighborhood who always harasses and bothers me and isn't nice either. I think he genuinely hates me because we had a forced conversation at the bus stop a year ago and I never wanted to talk with him since. I just called a hotline about this today and they helped me reach the conclusion that it's safest to ignore him until I can confront him with a friend and record it to send to the police.

I have watched so many beautiful days pass me by where I get no sun or fresh air because I'm afraid to be alone outside. I have been getting catcalled since I was 8 or 9 and I'm tired of ignoring it. I'm also just tired of experiencing it. Now it's not even a matter of what I will do when it happens. I just don't want it to happen to me anymore. I can't handle it and I can't handle there being no safe way to deal with this on my own. I used to be a very independent person and now I'm afraid of leaving my house.

I wish society viewed this kind of harassment as an actual threat. I wish I could know for a fact that if I confront this man and he assaults me, and I defend myself with the knife or taser or the baton I just ordered which I carry with me everywhere, I will get a fair day in court. I know for a fact that I will go to jail for beating a man twice my size with a baton. Even if he bothers me whenever he sees me, and has been doing this for a year, even if I confront him and he steps closer to me and threatens me, I will go to jail for defending myself. The man is literally twice my size. I have been beaten by men twice my size before. Men are stronger and you simply cannot take chances once they start assaulting you. I don't understand why more people don't realize this.

I'm at such a loss. I'm so tired of living like this. I know if someone bothers me it will ruin my day. I actually attempted suicide 2 weeks ago and am in a very fragile state so I know that even something minor will send me over the edge. I'm just sick of not leaving my house. I deserve sun and fresh air and to be able to walk to the gas station without a stranger inserting themselves into my life. I'm tired of sacrificing my dignity just so men around me don't get offended. I'm tired of cowering away when I'm actually armed to the teeth at all times and ready to defend myself, but won't stand up to a bully because I fear jail time.

I don't want to negotiate any of these details or look on the positive side. My entire life has been like this and I feel like I finally broke.

17jej21,WomensHealth,1698618694.0,"i'm 33, but i've had this problem since i was 27.

i've never smoked, i don't drink, i only started taking weed edibles after this started happening, and i exercised regularly. no other health issues. essentially, i've lost the ability to breathe properly. it feels like my diaphragm isn't expanding the way it should. this happened literally from one second to the next: i was walking my dog outside one night after work, i felt something in my abdomen constrict, and i haven't been the same since.

my symptoms are vague. i don't have pain. i can't get a deep enough breath in to yawn; my nose feels ""tight"" and congested, but i don't have mucus. i frequently run out of air mid-sentence. i have to ""sigh"" to breathe. my stomach feels bloated. i have edema on my right side. when my heart beats quickly, it feels like it's hitting the ""wrong"" spot in my chest. i've had an abdominal ultrasound, a pulmonary function test, and i've seen a cardiologist, but nothing came up. i lapsed in care after i had to see an otolaryngologist who looked up my nose, took a step back, and said, ""i don't know why you're here.""

but it's been five years and this is ruining my life. i'm tired all the time. i constantly feel like i'm running hotter than i should. but it's really the constant *air hunger* that i just can't get over; it's affected my ability to hold a job and my mental health to a degree that i can't just live with anymore. i wake up with it and i go to sleep with it. it is constant. there is nothing to ameliorate it. inhalers do nothing for me.

recently i started going back to the doctor, but i'm running into the same issue where before i can request any imaging, i get 20 questions about my mental health history and a weird kind of condescension from male doctors. i do have ptsd from years before this started, but it never manifested like this, and i've been seeing a therapist consistently because i have to prove that i'm not being hysterical about an anxiety attack. i get so demoralized trying to seek treatment because the second i see a doctor start going, ""well, are you sure it's not anxiety?"" my spine turns to wet paper and i know i'm going to get the medical equivalent of a pat on the head. there was a point where i'd spend hours of my day crying from the stress. my psychiatrist has written letters to various doctors sharing that he thinks the problem is not psychosomatic, but my pcp treats my periodic visits like a chore.

my insurance sucks and i haven't looked into getting female doctors, but i might have to. i don't know. i spent 4 years trying so hard to believe it's just anxiety, i've done every breathing exercise under the sun, i go for light exercise regularly, but nothing changes and i just cannot continue like this.

my question is: how do i get male doctors to listen to me about how much i need help without getting the ""anxiety"" brushoff? what do i say to get someone to take me seriously?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/17jej21/doctors_say_its_psychosomatic_psychiatrist_says/,doctors say it's psychosomatic. psychiatrist says it isn't. i'm going insane,,75,76,0.99,skdlgjslkg

ixzbx6,WomensHealth,1600819112.0,"Hi, everyone. I was the girl who was worried her ovary was dead, which turned into major abdominal surgery to remove a giant ovarian cyst (along with having some other things removed that kinda made me face my mortality). Whelp, there was interest in an update whenever it was confirmed what that thing was, and I now know for sure.

It...was not what the doctors were thinking. They at first thought that it would be either a germ cell malignancy or a ""borderline cancer tumor"". It was ovarian cancer. Advanced ovarian cancer in my 20s. They said it was exceedingly rare for my age...

It...well, it left me in tears. I had just graduated in the spring, and was planning to start my career when this all started. I had just finished my internship a couple of weeks before my surgery. Now...it will be a long while before I can enter paid work, both because we are unsure how the chemo will impact me, and because my family and I am reliant on the insurance to pay for this and entering the workforce now would put me at risk of losing that. Healthcare isn't cheap in the US, and if we didn't have that we would already be looking at hundreds of thousands for my abdominal procedure...

My chemo is expected to be 6 months long, and...well, I don't quite know how I will be able to calm myself down enough to handle the administration (I am looking at needles to the chest here, and f*ck am I afraid of needles). I...I probably won't even keep my hair. I recognized one of the chemo drugs they have planned for me, Taxol, as one that held higher risk for hair loss...I have had long, soft, wavy hair all my life, with its natural  hues ranging from dark blonde to brown...sometimes even looking reddish in the right light. It can be wild, but its part of my identity and...and I like it about me. Now, the chemo will likely take that too. Cold caps aren't an option, because that is thousands of dollars...and insurance won't pay for that as it is still deemed a cosmetic expense in our state. I can't ask anybody to help pay for something like that, even if it was guaranteed to let me keep my hair. It is way too much.

On top of that, the operation that removed my ovary, fallopian tube, as well as a chunk of my spleen and diaphragm? After waking up from it, I was still happy...because I was informed I did in fact have the rest of my reproductive system. Whelp...I found out it is very possible that after chemo, they may want to remove my other ovary and my uterus. I...I can't even fathom that...

There is a bright side; I...I was told that my cancer was extremely treatable, even in its later stages. The doctor phrased it as ""the cells practically melt under the treatment"". So...I still have my life.

I just feel so weak and helpless now, even after going through college and getting my first gig as a manager and succeeding...this popped up and knocked the entire train off its tracks. Its just, what the hell?

I was put on birth control as soon as I turned 14 because I had to have two large ovarian cysts removed. Each side had a cyst the size of an orange, and my doctor warned me it could happen again if I didn't get on birth control. He told my I had ""multi-cystic ovaries"" but not PCOS. 

I've never wanted kids, so this was all fine with me. I was on the pill for 17 years until I started getting migraines, so my Dr switched me to nexplanon for the next 3 years.

Fast forward to now, my mental health meds are stabilized, my husband had a vasectomy, and I'm ready to find out for sure if I have PCOS but the only way to find out is to get off birth control. 

My Dr removed the nexplanon 2 weeks ago, and the first week was normal, but shortly after that I started having weird shifts in my mood. Each day seems dedicated to a different emotion. One day I repeatedly got irritated through the day, the next I'd cry sporadically, after that I kept feeling touchy and cuddly which is very unlike me.

I guess I'm asking cause I'm dealing with vaginismus and it can be really difficult to deal with at times.

v4qwdq,WomensHealth,1654355574.0,"Hey ladies, I'm currently freaking out and could use some sage wisdom and comfort.

Basically, I had sex for the first time and am now dealing with medical issues I didn't expect. I was very tight and expected some pain in the morning to come. Also, we didn't use a condom. Bad idea, I'm aware, but what's happened has happened.

What I got was pain, blood, and strange discharge (yellow and a lot. Ive been wearing pads). It's been a couply days and the pain has gone down significantly,  but the blood and discharge remains. This morning I woke up to inner thigh lymph nodes swollen.

I know what I need to do. But it's such a pain in the ass trying to find somewhere to get tested and checked out. I've never had a pelvic exam so that's a bit intimidating too. It's the weekend so not a lot of places are open and I really want to be seen soon to ease my mind and because I work M-F. (I can't easily call out due to my position)

Does anyone know if Urgent Cares do pelvic exams? Or ER's if I must (although I'm scared of whatever my insurance will charge me).

Mostly I'm just scared to be going through this alone. I don't live near any family or trusted friends. And I don't want to tell them anyways. It's embarrassing that I engaged in such risky behavior and might have contracted something.

So that's my story of woe and anxiety. Sorry for the tmi and ranting. I just don't have anyone to talk to about this. Any kind thoughts are appreciated.

ojesgv,WomensHealth,1626180188.0,"In the weeks before surgery, I kept looking for detailed posts about robotic myomectomy recovery, and I couldn‚Äôt find much. So I decided to write down my experience every day and post it here. I had the surgery yesterday (07/12). 


**3 hours after surgery:** The surgery went on from 7AM to 12PM. It was supposed to last 3 hours and a half, but they found another fibroid! My husband was very worried, but the doctor called him as soon as it was over, and she explained that it took so long because they were able to remove an 11cm fibroid and another 3cm one, bit by bit, through a tiny 1.5cm incision. Science is amazing!
 
**It is now 3PM**, I woke up just an hour ago, and to say I am groggy is an understatement. My mom called me, but I‚Äôm pretty sure nothing I said made any sense. I keep dozing off and having the most vivid dreams. The most recent one was about Monty Python's Life of Brian, and I woke up talking about the Judean People‚Äôs Front (or the People‚Äôs Front of Judea lol). Right now I feel insanely nauseated, but I don‚Äôt feel any pain. I also feel lighter, like they took a dead weight off of me. 


**5PM, 5hours after surgery:** I‚Äôm able to stand and take a few steps. My nurse is very happy, and she says I can go home soon if I keep improving quickly like this. I still have a lot of nausea, sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm really about to throw up, so she‚Äôs giving me more medicine for it. It‚Äôs still so hard to stay awake! I am exhausted, but I am so happy about how my belly feels. The difference is already so noticeable, I don‚Äôt know how I lived with that monster fibroid for so long. 


**7PM, 7 hours after surgery:** we‚Äôre going home! We just picked up the meds at CVS - Ibuprofen, OxyContin and Docusate Sodium. I don‚Äôt want to take the OxyContin, I think I might be able to go through this on Ibuprofen only. I don‚Äôt feel any pain now. I just feel completely exhausted and dizzy. 


**4AM, 16 hours hours after surgery:** I just woke up crying because of the pain, it is unbearable. It hurts to breathe, and the thought of standing up sends shivers down my spine. I feel that my bladder is full, and maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing such terrible pain. I‚Äôm calling my husband, who‚Äôs sleeping downstairs (he moves a lot at night), to help me go to the bathroom to pee. Standing up and walking to the bathroom was absolute torture, I was just screaming in pain. I‚Äôm now taking the opioid. I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Peeing felt VERY different than before. The 11cm fibroid was sitting right on top of my bladder, and now that it‚Äôs gone, it feels just‚Ä¶ right. Now I feel like I can actually empty my bladder when I go, and I don‚Äôt have to pee every hour anymore. Even though I‚Äôm in a lot of pain, I‚Äôm happy. 


**8AM, 20 hours after surgery:** I feel MUCH better. I‚Äôm taking all meds on time, and walking to the bathroom this morning feels easier. Sitting up doesn‚Äôt hurt nearly as much as I thought it would, and it‚Äôs even more comfortable than lying down. I‚Äôm having breakfast in bed, and reading my favorite book. Overall I‚Äôm surprised by how well I feel today considering the nightmarish night I had. My dogs are in the bedroom with me, we‚Äôre separated by a gate. It‚Äôs hard to stay away from them while they look at me with such melancholic eyes.

I distracted myself for a second aaand I spilled the whole thing to the floor (yes, the cup was full!) So it was a bloody bloody mess!

Then I start to hear gasps from outside, and girls asking me if I'm OK and wtf is going on, apparently seeing a puddle of blood between two feet, the first thing that comes to mind is a miscarriage.

We couldn't keep away. We would do 2 rounds a day for months. But he, regrettably, caused me emotional trauma which led to me not being sexually attracted to him. We still have sex but it's barely once a week. I'd put it around 3 times a month if I'm being honest and it is never because I initiate. I don't even think about sex until he brings it up. I am attracted to him, he's very good looking and has a nice body. He's also vastly changed since the trauma and I only wish he'd been this guy from the start. He has owned up and taken responsibility and is ever increasing in his growth to being a better partner. I do love him. But everytime we have sex, it's painful. I feel like I can't relax my body and it honestly feels like he's peeling skin back everytime he pumps. We have to use lube because I don't/can't produce any myself.

So we have been growing further and further apart, and because of that I have had to lean on myself more to support myself emotionally because I can no longer lean on him. And honestly it ultimately is a good thing because I recognize that I have many codependent traits which have slowly been lessening because of this. 

But, this entire situation is extremely stressful. I never know when that resentfulness is going to show it's ugly head from him. And when it does, I am now more able to cope with it, and not let it completely destroy me. But it is EXHAUSTING constantly having to pick myself up, and living with the person that requires me to do so. 

It didn't used to be this way. Like most relationships it started out great. But somewhere along the way things got fucky. Although we had our unhealthy habits back then, we were at least able to function well enough to be supportive and loving and caring.

I am a 29 year old female from the north east (nj/nyc) region. I had been told I have pelvic pain first then officially diagnosed with primary vaginismus for as long as I can remember. Been to multiple doctors and tried many creams, pills, (one doc literally told me I needed to ‚Äòrelax and drink a glass of wine‚Äô and another has said ‚ÄòI need to just deal w it‚Äô) etc which were at no avail...until about 4 months ago, I started seeing my amazing pelvic floor physical therapist. 

I started off by seeing her 3 times per week, and then as I progressed we dropped down to 2 times per week. My physical therapist even offered homecare sessions to allow me to get comfortable in my surroundings. All covered by insurance. Literally, from beginning to end, I would say it took 3-3.5 months during Physical Therapy.

I can finally say I am healed. No more pain w sex, no more fear of vaginal exams and back to 100% normal life. 

I am posting this because I would like to give hope to those who have vaginismus. Complete cure is possible with a very well trained and patient pelvic floor physical therapist. DM if you‚Äôd like to know more about my battle w vaginismus or contact info to my physical therapist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/mbupl7/my_journey_w_pelvic_painvaginismus/,My journey w pelvic pain/vaginismus,,74,2,0.99,None

I have used 10 pads and (although im ashamed to admit this) 2 adult diapers in the past 13 hours and bled through every single one of them. I have a migraine that makes even the vibration feedback as i type feel like torture. Should i just try to sleep this off or should i wake my husband and son to take me to the ER? I'm close to tears from the headache and nothing is making it stop. Other than the headache, nausea and general shakiness ive been okay, i was able to watch after my toddler up until I asked his grandma to take over at around 7 due to the monstrous migraine. 

Thing is I dont want to burden medical staff as covid rates are extremely high in my area and medical staff is dealing with enough. And as my son is under two i wouldnt be able to put a mask on him if I did end up going to the ER (masks are unsafe for children unser two because their lungs arent as developed) so I have the added stress of his health, and my husband is am essential worker so exposing him to even more risk is not an appealing option. 

Can I sleep it off or should I go to the ER?

While looking over everything, I‚Äôm really surprised to see that HIV/AIDS, Herpes and Syphilis were never included in any of the STD panels I had requested from OB/GYN‚Äôs in the past.

I‚Äôd always assumed that everything serious would be covered by letting an OB/GYN know I want a full panel of STD tests.

Last time I asked about HIV and herpes, my doc looked surprised and said ‚Äúare you experiencing symptoms or do you feel you‚Äôve been exposed?‚Äù When I said no, she explained that she doesn‚Äôt typically order HIV or herpes testing unless there‚Äôs suspected exposure. That surprised me. Why wouldn‚Äôt HIV be included in a typical STD/STI test? So I requested to be tested anyway, and discovered that my insurance doesn‚Äôt cover HIV testing and got a $195 bill in the mail. 

When the nurse called me a week later and went through my results, I asked ‚Äúwhat about syphilis, wasn‚Äôt that included in the test?‚Äù She said no they no longer include syphilis in preventative STD screening because it has become so rare.

Is this true? I recently read that Japan is seeing some of the biggest syphilis numbers in years.

r3jazb,TwoXSupport,1638036923.0,"I've been noticing an uptick recently in memes/jokes relating to women having trust issues in heterosexual relationships that feel so much heavier than they're intended to be I think. The jokes themselves are usually in good fun and not meant to insinuate that women are overemotional or paranoid, but they do touch on expressing how much anxiety women can feel in romantic relationships with men, and it's kind of heartbreaking.

One of those memes is the ""he's probably cheating"" meme, the one that shows up often in the form of tiktoks, and starts with the text saying something like ""her: he hasn't responded to my texts all night, he's probably cheating"" then it cuts to said man doing something really silly yet innocuous with his friends, like playing out a scene from a movie or playing a really bizarre game with his friends. Another one I see is the inverse, a bunch of women together trying to decipher whether one of their boyfriend's is cheating, e.g.: I just saw a tiktok with the caption ""when he goes out with the boys and his follower count goes up by one"" and shows all the women printing out his entire follower list and trying to figure out who the new one is (that one was admittedly a little yuckier).

Obviously these memes are meant to be hyperbolic, but I notice myself getting kinda sad when I see them, mostly because it portrays some very real problems. One being that most women are so traumatized by men that being in a relationship can be an anxiety fueled retraumatizing mess where they're just constantly waiting for history to repeat itself, and another being that these trust issues create such a divide in relationships and make it hard to form genuinely trusting secure bonds with your partner. I think it's a problem on both ends, because the women in that situation are anxious and scared, and the men in that situation (the decent ones at least) are feeling confused and as much as they want to help and try to, they can't answer for the sins of the past men or fix that underlying problem, and when that trauma shows up as hostility, it pushes them away and makes them feel abandoned and ""bad"".

I don't know, it's just something I've been thinking about a lot, especially when I see one of those jokes. I'm single right now but I do notice how when it comes to men I date, I often am living in my trauma and suffering from this cognitive dissonance where every fiber of my being is telling me to keep my guard up, no matter what, because it's not safe. And I think it's sad because it really affects the potential for healthy relationships. I wonder how much easier life would be for so many women if we were both able to seek out healthy relationships with healthy men, and understand that 1) just because they have the power to hurt you, doesn't mean they will, and 2) if they do, it's not your fault, and it's not because you weren't hypervigilant enough.

I feel like my doctor didn‚Äôt do her job properly but idk since I‚Äôve only had a Pap smear test twice.

I had what seemed like a nice doctor. She said her pleasantries and introduced herself, I changed clothes, the usual stuff. It was a normal check up until the Pap smear. She put in the speculum without any lube and complained I was dry. It was not comfortable inside (and probably TMI but I‚Äôve handled worse‚Äî except usually prep).


When I explained she hadn‚Äôt exactly given me warning, she said nothing and finished up the exam.

Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting, but I feel really frustrated that she handled it that way. I feel it‚Äôs common sense to not shove something in without using lube before, not after. The lube after felt like either an after thought or her trying to make it better in some sense.

mwbmwq,TwoXSupport,1619116998.0,"I hope that it's okay to post this here. I really just need a group of women to commiserate with because I am in some of the worst pain I've ever experienced.

I'm 29 and my now ex-partner is 35. We spent two years together, and most of those days were happy. We hugged, we kissed, we worked through our own personal trauma to be better for one another. We loved deeply, or at least that's what I thought. Recently I found out that he had been cheating on me with other women throughout the entirety of our relationship. Whether it was online affairs, or in person sex without condoms... He was cheating.

I'm currently grieving the person who I thought he was. I'm grieving the happy days that we had that weren't real and I'm grieving to happy days that we won't get to have anymore. I'm grieving my dignity and I'm grieving the trust that I thought I had with him.

He was Charming when we first met and I fell in love with him instantly. Our love was hard and fast and it also seemed to have legs to last a long time. Other than the difficult moments that we experienced like every relationship has, I felt like we were perpetually in the honeymoon stage.

I started working out because I knew he liked fit girls, I started different meds because the ones that I was on made it difficult for me to have sex. I started therapy to be the best partner that I could be for him because my trauma sometimes made me difficult to be around. I kept the house clean, and I cooked for him every single day.

We got a second cat, a kitten. A beautiful kitten. He said that he liked voids, he said that black cats were his favourite. So I did my best to find a black cat for us to get. As we drove home with her he told me that he was so happy that our little family was growing. At the same time he was having a very intensely sexual, intensely D/s relationship with somebody over Twitter. When I found out I felt a pain that I didn't know existed. But after days and weeks of crying, I wanted to feel better, I forced myself to believe it was a one-off, and he made me feel like I hadn't been intimate with him in the way that he needed, and I forgave him on the agreement that he'd start therapy.
After that our days were happy again. He did therapy every single week, for the first month. Then he moved down to bi-weekly. It seemed to be working he was dealing with a lot of his trauma, and our communication improved.

It was only a few months until I found him having sex with a woman who he had uncovered sex with last March, in out bed. I lost my mind and I punched him in the face, I ripped the pictures off the wall and I hit him with them. I was naked from exiting the shower and he picked me up by my shoulders and he tossed me into the hallway of our condo building. After reading through his Twitter messages which I had access to after the first time I caught him cheating, I found that he had sex with this girl way back when. Later on I asked him if he had had a threesome with two girls who he had spent the night with doing a photoshoot. He said yes. The morning after he cheated he came home and held me closely, reassuring me that he was too drunk to drive home.

The cherry on top is that we were in an open relationship. He could have had sex with whoever he wanted it as long as he communicated to me and wore a condom. And he couldn't even do that.

Before we started dating I hated men. I hated relationship. I hate it all of it. I knew they couldn't be trusted. And for some reason I trusted him and I loved him and he made me goo goo eyed. He made me believe that there were good men in the world, and he made me believe that I could love and trust him. I don't know where to go from here. I'm in such an Exquisite amount of pain.

I'm sorry if this was long and doesn't make much sense, I'm still only 3 or 4 days out of catching him cheating, and my mind is a mess.

I rarely had periods whilst on contraception which didn‚Äôt bother me.

I told doctors about my concerns a year ago, they said they can‚Äôt test me for issues regarding it because of my age. It deterred me from bringing it up again, and now I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôm just infertile but with no way of actually knowing.

He wants me to try waxing etc. I told him I don‚Äôt want to because it‚Äôs honestly super painful and my skin is delicate and gets irritated easily. Plus, my hair grows extremely fast. And I know hair to an extent actually helps keep us healthy down there.

He accepts my answer kind of but keeps bugging me about it every once in a while, saying I don‚Äôt want to make him happy because I don‚Äôt want to be completely clean shaven or cut my long hair and make it short (like above my shoulders).

And look, I want to give him that experience and I‚Äôve tried shaving but I can‚Äôt get a close enough shape.

15cirvg,WomensHealth,1690604813.0,"Hi everyone, currently going through the struggle of an unplanned pregnancy while on Nexplanon and wanted to ask for some advice/support here. Curious if anyone has gone through something similar, or might have any advice? Just really struggling to find support right now 

I got my last Nexplanon implant inserted 02/22/2021 - this was my second implant insertion (got the previous one removed and replaced after 3 years), and it has always worked for pregnancy prevention up until this point. The first time I had the implant I stopped getting my period for about a year, then in came back and occured about every 25 days. With this most recent implant I continued to get my period monthly, like clockwork, every 21 days. When I was a couple of days late I thought I might just be not getting my period like what had happened the first time I got the implant. I started having anxiety so I got a Clear Blue test just to be sure. Sure enough, I got a positive result. Took 3 more.. all positive. 

Honestly, I am still in such shock over this. I have always been told that the implant is the most effective form of birth control - over 99% effective. I‚Äôve now been to 2 Planned Parenthoods and my OBGYN and everyone had similar shocked reactions when the pregnancy tests came back positive. All providers that I have seen confirmed that my implant was properly placed in my arm just as it had been since insertion. I had my implant removed today and the OB is sending it in for testing. She told me that in the research that she could access, there hasn‚Äôt been a Nexplanon pregnancy recorded in her database for at least the last 5 years. So woah.. just a really crazy outlier/anomaly situation.

Now I‚Äôm faced with what feels like an impossible decision - to terminate the pregnancy or to move forward and carry it to term. The decision is honestly tearing me apart

I am 30(F) and my partner is 42(M). We have been together for a little bit under a year but have been good friends for many years. I have always wanted children and am SO excited about the prospect of having a child even though this is happening much sooner than I anticipated. My partner has said that he is open to children, but has been very clear that he is not ready for this right now and wants me to have an abortion. His family feels the same way. We are both in very good financial positions, and I feel both mentally and emotionally prepared for this. His reasons for not wanting a child are that he does not feel ready, and he wants us to spend more time as a couple before we bring a child into the mix.

I love my partner tremendously but I fear that if I move forward with this pregnancy he will be supportive but will resent me for the rest of our lives. If I choose to terminate, I feel like I very well may regret that decision and resent him for it. I am 30, about to turn 31.  

I‚Äôm scared, and feeling very alone right now. Should we wait until a time when we both feel ready to have a child? The prospect of bringing a child into this world with one parent who isn‚Äôt excited about them terrifies me. This just feels like an unexpected and overwhelming situation, so any advice from anyone who has gone through something similar would be greatly appreciated

UPDATE: Thank you all so much for sharing your stories, and offering so much love, support, and advice over the past couple of days. Some of your responses made me laugh, some made me cry, but all of them made me feel so much less alone. I feel so grateful to be in this space with such incredible and resilient humans and I appreciate you all for taking time out of your day to help me during this confusing and chaotic time. 

My partner and I have had a challenging few days - we got into couples counseling with an incredible coach and figured out how to communicate how we were feeling more effectively. He‚Äôs cut his family out of the decision, and we‚Äôve been able to hone in and focus on what this decision will mean for us, and us alone. Ultimately, we decided to move forward with the pregnancy. I can see him getting more excited about it by the day, and I know he is going to be the best father. Growth/change can be uncomfortable and painful sometimes, but I know he is going to be up for the challenge. We are trying not to get too excited yet because we still have a few doctor‚Äôs appointments/ ultrasound to get through. But if all goes well, we will have our sweet little baby late March/Early April next year! 

Again, thank you so much to all of you for helping us get here.

11zui6e,WomensHealth,1679599523.0," 

I had a lot of fear going into my endometrial biopsy, so I figured I'd share now that I've been through it in case anyone is also having one of these in the future.

The biopsy was ordered because of unusual bleeding I'd been having recently. I was diagnosed with PCOS a few weeks ago, and the doctors wanted to make sure I don't have cancerous or pre-cancerous cells in my uterus. I was also given transvaginal ultrasound to look for fibroids.

The day of the EMB I had no prior instructions except to make sure to drink water and get some calories in my body before the procedure. They were so serious about that last point that when I told them I actually had not eaten anything because I was nervous, they made me eat some graham crackers before doing the procedure. Calories on board is important because some women react badly to the procedure and can experience dizziness or even fainting.

I also took 600mg of ibuprofen an hour prior, and this helped. I wish I'd taken 800.

Once there, the nurse practitioner who was going to do the EMB told me what to expect. There would be another tech present for safety but the NP would do the procedure alone. I would be laying down on the table with feet in stirrups, undressed from the waist down.

I got ready and she came in with the tech and got seated in front of me. She inserted the speculum and did a swab for a general pap test. Then she cleaned the surface of the cervix (I was currently menstruating) in prep for the biopsy. This process was uncomfortable for me - some women have more sensitivity in the cervix than others, and I'm one of them. It was a strange dull, achy, scraping and surface tenderness that I later told her felt like ""a canker sore at the end of my vagina"" but from what I hear, this is *not* typical of how most women feel during this part.

Then, I was given a lidocaine injection to help with the pain. I am glad I got this. It was offered to me, but if your provider doesn't offer it, ask. As I'll explain in a minute, it didn't feel like it did much, but I'd hate to know what it would have felt like without it. The injection itself was not very painful and as far as I can tell it went into effect right away.

Then the NP inserted something to stabilize the cervix during the procedure. The tech handed me a heating pad to place over my lower abdomen to help with cramping, which probably didn't do much but felt like it was helping so I was glad to have it. The cervix now held in place, the NP inserted a long thing canula with a device on the end for scraping and suctioning tissue from the inside of the uterus. She told me this was the part that was going to hurt, and it would take less than one minute.

When the device started scraping, my uterus started contracting. I had been imagining menstrual cramps; this was worse. I've never given birth but I imagine it's something like labor contractions. The surrounding muscles seized also, contracted in and down in the direction of the device, which added to the sensation of an organ being sucked out through my pelvis. The cramping in my pelvic floor and anus was very bad also.

So here's the answer to the question you're probably here with: how much did it hurt? Honestly I will say this: it was the worst pain I've ever been in in my life, *but* it was *not* as bad as my wildest imagination feared. I didn't suddenly wish I was dead, and I don't feel traumatized. But in the moment I was instantly crying, shaking, found it hard to breathe, and the procedure was indeed less than a minute but it felt like longer. Frankly it sucked, real bad. I don't look forward to ever having to do it again. BUT it was survivable. If you need to do this biopsy, you will be ok, but it will be significant pain for a minute. I'm sorry.

The NP withdrew the device and the stabilizing thing and the speculum all in one fairly fluid motion and it was suddenly over. Fortunately, the contracting and the sharp pain stopped, and there was still cramping and tenderness but not anywhere near on the level of when it was in progress. I was crying and shaking still, and still having a hard time breathing. The tech left, and the NP came over to me with a cool pack for my head, and held that on my forehead while helping me hold the warm pack over my abdomen. She told me it was ok to cry if I needed to cry. We sat like that for a couple of minutes while I got my breathing under control. The pain started to subside. I asked her to lift up the head of the table and she did.

She handed me a heavy-duty pad and said there would be some bleeding for about a day, and to use pads, not tampons, and not to insert anything vaginally for a few days. She left so I could get dressed, and I found that I was able to stand up and get dressed without any issue.

1 day later, I still feel a dull achiness like bad period pain in my uterus, and every once in awhile just a *tiny* hint of a sharp pain around the cervix. I am not bleeding very much. I know this is going to heal up ok and I'll be fine. I am expecting results of the biopsy in about a week.

I hope this is ok for the sub and that it helps anyone who is scared of the procedure. *You are right to be apprehensive about the pain*, because it's real, but it's still worth doing to get answers, and it is over quickly. I went on to have a pretty normal day afterward, I even ran some errands and bought some new clothes (a little retail therapy to get the bad feelings out of my head). I did not have any nightmares about it last night. But everyone is different.

If you have sexual trauma - I do - tell the care provider ahead of time. The NP took great care to make me feel like I was in control during the procedure. There is still going to be an element of ""I don't want this to keep happening, and yet it's happening anyway"" while the procedure is going on that can be uncomfortably reminiscent of assault, but I reminded myself that this was my choice to do it and that nobody was making me do it, I was there because I wanted to take care of my health. If you are particularly sensitive to penetration as a trigger from past sexual assault, take great care and communicate what will make you the most comfortable. And honestly, the fact that the NP stayed with me for a bit to help me calm down afterward, and acted as a gentle physical presence without speaking, helped me disentangle the feeling of physical intrusion from a potential feeling of emotional violation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/11zui6e/just_had_an_endometrial_biopsy_wanted_to_share_my/,"Just had an endometrial biopsy, wanted to share my experience",Support/Personal Experience ,69,60,0.98,calliope720

I made a doctors appointment in my old town I lived in with my exhusband. My intent was to tell him about the lump and get a referral to whomever I would see about such a thing in my hometown. Well my extremely amazing doctor basically stopped everything and said ""oh no, we're taking care of this right now"". So all by myself while bawling my eyes out, I'm getting a mammogram and an ultrasound. I got a letter the other day stating: *NORMAL/BENIGN*. I don't think I've ever gotten a better letter üò∏

Im embarrassed to admit but a few years ago I had to get a stuck tampon removed so I felt around just in case and yep, I could definitely feel and pull on something but I couldn‚Äôt get it out.

I went to the emergency room yesterday where the doctor looked with a speculum and couldn‚Äôt see anything. She examined me with her fingers and said she did feel something but had to refer me to the gynaecologist as she couldn‚Äôt get a grip on it. Today I saw the gynae, who did a ‚Äúthorough‚Äù speculum and physical exam but said she couldn‚Äôt feel or see anything and there was nothing else she could do.

I‚Äôm extremely worried now because I KNOW something is there, I went to the toilet after at the hospital to try to feel it and it felt like it was pushed right at the back. I told the nurse this and she consulted her superior who said that there was nothing else they could do if I have been examined and no one saw anything. 

Last time they had trouble finding it because it had got stuck sideways at the back of the vagina near the cervix. I don‚Äôt know what else to do now and I feel like the doctor didn‚Äôt believe me, which is making me second guess if I even put one in.

12zv013,WomensHealth,1682535808.0,"This is mainly a rant because I have angry/frustrated/anxiously cried a lot over this. Doctors either don‚Äôt have a clue what it could be, decide not to pursue it further, or blatantly disregard my symptoms. 
Also sorry, this is both long and the format might be off cause I‚Äôm on mobile. 

So back in October I started to have symptoms of appendicitis. All of a sudden, sharp pains in my lower right side (not enough I felt like I needed the ER right away but definitely concerning). Other symptoms were nausea/feeling full after a bite of food, very loose bowel movements alternating with full on constipation, extremely aggressive stomach noises, and hot flashes. My bf and I had sushi, so we were both hoping it was food poisoning. 

After two days of sharp pain, I go to urgent care. Website said they had scan capabilities. Get there and they don‚Äôt, but they palpitate my abdomen, ask basic food related questions then do an STI panel. Everything came back normal and confirms that I am not pregnant. Doc says follow up with my GP. I try to follow up, GP says there are no appts for months so go to ER if I think it is worse. 

Eventually I get an appointment with my practice and the doc refuses to do a scan. She says cause I don‚Äôt scream when she touches my belly, it can‚Äôt be appendicitis. While I do get that, there are other things that could be detected by a scan right? She does a blood test instead and states that given the timing in my cycle an ovarian cyst is unlikely. I told her my mom at my age had debilitating cysts, for years. She shrugs and sends me home, after giving me a shocked/disbelieving ‚Äôreally?‚Äô when I said it was already disrupting my life. I was missing work for this appointment and unable to work out in general and I LOVE to exercise. 

Flash forward months, I still have horrible symptoms, I can‚Äôt work out a lot, I am exhausted and constantly napping after work, I‚Äôm not eating enough cause I‚Äôm f-ing nauseous, my stomach is making obnoxious sounds so much it wakes me and my bf up at night. It‚Äôs also embarrassing cause it‚Äôs that sound movies use to show a character is about to shit themselves or just relentlessly passing gas. Neither of which happened to me, but the sound and pressure is what gets to me during the day. 

I get a new doctor, and she says it‚Äôs probably IBS. I push for a scan, and turns out I have a fairly large ovarian cyst (large enough I get a surgical consult). Surgical gyn thinks it could be endometriosis but they can‚Äôt tell for sure until they cut me open. ORs are booked out months, so they book another ultrasound for a month before my OR appointment. 

Meanwhile same symptoms, though the nausea has died down. I still have sharp pain in my lower abdomen (a few times I cried, and I consider I have a high pain tolerance), obnoxiously loud stomach noises that I can feel (gas ex, and treatments for gas did not work or help. Same with diet changes), alternating near diarrhea and constipation, exhaustion. 

Monday, I heard back that the cyst had resolved enough that they won‚Äôt remove it. There‚Äôs a new cyst on the other ovary, but it‚Äôs smaller and simple, so they will just let it resolve on its own. Which I get, don‚Äôt cut someone up if they don‚Äôt absolutely need it. 

But I have no idea what else to do.

One doc was shocked I said it was impacting my life. Another forgot completely about half my symptoms. Another said stomach noises are normal despite this started basically overnight and is beyond loud, frequent, and aggressive than normal. 

I just needed to rant and honestly if anyone has ideas or something similar happen. I‚Äôd love to hear. 

I didn‚Äôt mention earlier but I have an IUD (kyleena). I got it in August and didn‚Äôt have symptoms until October. I also have a blood clotting disorder so pretty much all birth control except the copper IUD and kyleena IUD are not viable for me, and personally, I don‚Äôt trust condoms as the only bc.

Edit- in case I don‚Äôt respond to everyone, thank you all so much for responding and your support. It is a comfort (even if sad we‚Äôve all had something of a similar experience).

Update: spoke to my doctor about my IUD being the cause, and she doesn‚Äôt think so. Since i tolerated the pill back when I was in high school (I took it for 9 months or so before I knew about the risk), she would rather get a GI consult before sending me to the gyno to remove the IUD. üò™ I have an appt with a GI doctor so here‚Äôs to hoping they have an idea.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/12zv013/i_feel_like_my_doctors_arent_listening/,I feel like my doctors aren‚Äôt listening,Rant,69,58,0.96,ElysianMango

qvjvw2,TwoXSupport,1637101525.0,"Trigger warning: sexual assault & abuse, rape

Hey everyone, I'm just here looking for any and all support I can get in the coming days and weeks. 

I don't want to say when specifically, but I'll be testifying against my abuser in trial soon, and it has me incredibly anxious. The investigation process is so drawn out (it has been a year since he was charged) and I was told this is the shortest amount of time it could have possibly taken. But the length has taken such a huge mental and emotional toll on me. 

Luckily the trial will be set up in a way that I shouldn't have to see him at all. But I am still terrified of running into him or there being some kind of mishap. I have some supports in place that I am thankful for, but I am still trying to prepare as best I can because I know this day is going to be horrible. 

I have been procrastinating reading through all my statements again about the details or the various sexual assaults and rapes he has been charged for, because I just *really* don't want to think about them. Of course I have to though. Ugh. 

I have been feeling pretty down lately, and trying to find methods of strengthening and empowering myself so that I can get through that day. I don't have much time left to do so, so any uplifting words would mean so much. 

One thing I am trying to remember is that I'm not just doing this for me and because of my own actions, but that it's much bigger than me. I'm doing it for the other women I know he abused and mistreated, in hopes he will not harm anyone again in the future. I'm also doing for all my friends who I have since learned have also experienced sexual assault, sexual abuse, domestic violence, and harm at the hands of similarly vile men. With whatever strength I have left I am trying to follow through with this unbelievably taxing process in hopes that one evil bastard in the world might be held accountable for his actions.

oq4xnd,WomensHealth,1627054653.0,"Hey guys I am a 25 year old female here and I have something that I MUST share with you guys! For over a year I suffered from BV with ALL the terrible symptoms: Smelly discharge, itchy irritation, burning while peeing and just overall not feeling so good down there. 

The first time I got symptoms of BV I went to the doctor and my doctor stated that I did have BV after a pap, so she gave me antibiotics. I took all of the antibiotics then felt better afterwards. Well a week or so goes by and my symptoms are back again. I repeated this process 4 TIMES until I finally just gave up. I was discouraged and upset and just decided to deal with it. 

I ended up having BV on and off for over a year and it was awful. I reached a point where I decided to do some research on BV and home remedies that helped it. I did ALL the home remedies and nothing. After further research I learned that antibiotics can actually make BV worse because it not only gets rid of the bad bacteria, but also gets rid of the good so you have a clean slate in there perfect for the bad bacteria to go right back in. I also learned that working out and sweating (something I do everyday) doesn‚Äôt help. So every time I was working out I was making it worse. 

So thanks to Tik Tok I found this amazing product that has literally changed my life. It‚Äôs called PHD Boric Acid Suppositories! This is for an off PH, UTI‚Äôs or BV. The good thing about this is you just stick the pill up there before bed using an applicator and it does it‚Äôs magic over night. The first night my odor was GONE!! But I kept going because it says to use it for a full week so I finished the week out. Let me tell ya, after that week I felt AMAZING. 

Fast forward to today, almost 2 months later. I haven‚Äôt had a single symptom since. I have no more awful odor and I feel comfortable in my own skin. If you are someone who suffer from BV please give this a try, it has seriously changed my life and I have no idea what I would do if I never saw this stuff on Tik Tok!

Understandably, I‚Äôve been experiencing plenty of emotions since, mostly happiness and feelings of freedom. However, now that the biggest challenge I‚Äôve been facing has been overcome, I have some questions that I‚Äôm a bit confused about. 

I became sexually active over a year ago, and penetration was never possible, it felt like I was being torn apart every single time. After working things through in therapy and with my gyno, that pain isn‚Äôt there anymore. 

However, there‚Äôs still some discomfort and I‚Äôm unsure if it‚Äôs normal or an issue. There‚Äôs still a sharp pain upon insertion, that only lasts about a second and then goes away. I‚Äôm pretty sure that still has to do with vaginismus, because it‚Äôs not there when I‚Äôm being fingered. It really doesn‚Äôt bother me that much.

PIV feels amazing for me emotionally, but doesn‚Äôt really feel like much physically. Depending on the angle, I tend to feel the urge to pee (even though I make sure to pee beforehand) that completely disappears as soon as whatever is inside me comes out. Also sometimes, if the angle is completely wrong I feel a sharp pain in my pelvic organs (I‚Äôm guessing hitting my cervix? Its always accidental and happens once or twice). It does feel nice at times, on certain angles and pace, but I don‚Äôt expect it to get me anywhere really. 

I‚Äôm mostly curious about a friction feeling. I‚Äôm on birth control, so dryness is a huge issue for me. Therefore, I use a fuckton of lube. We also use condoms as a backup method, to make sure we are as safe as possible. Every single time I‚Äôve had PIV I‚Äôve felt this uncomfortable friction that becomes painful the longer it lasts. It‚Äôs a little less painful if it‚Äôs at a very slow pace, but you can imagine why that‚Äôs not really a great strategy. 

It‚Äôs not terrible, I enjoy a little pain and it feels nice if it doesn‚Äôt last a long time. But I‚Äôm curious if this is normal, if it eventually goes away with practice, or if I‚Äôm maybe missing something that‚Äôs causing it.

idc5vo,TwoXSupport,1597936597.0,"I've had a realization I need to work through, figured this might be a good spot to post it? Sorry, it's long. 

Okay, so here's the thing. I'm fat. There's no two ways about it. And I'm pretty mentally well adjusted to it; a lot of it is due to medications that I'm on, but also, I love food, so I'm not denying responsibility for it. And I'm not ashamed of it, either. My body does so much for me, and it's pretty damn awesome. Plus, we've gotten some medications changed, and I've been successfully pulling weight off over the last few months. 
Of course, growing up, I always thought I was gigantic. Looking back, it would be amazing to be the size I was the first time I thought I was fat, because I was totally not fat. I was just built along heavier lines than all my friends, but I had curves, and was a little softer. Unfortunately, I had no self confidence about my body, either, and I gained weight and felt ashamed, and lost out on a lot of social experiences with guys during my 20's because I thought I wasn't good enough. 

Things started to change for me, mentally, when I hit my 30's. I turn 33 tomorrow. And I've been slowly losing the weight. But I've realized something, and it's terrifying. Being fat has kept me safe.

I have hidden behind my mask of the smart fat girl my whole life. I haven't dated much. I'd like to be in a relationship, but I have a lot of trust issues. ( When I was quite young, I experienced some kind of trauma/assault. I don't remember it, and I haven't spoken about it with family. It has come up during my therapy sessions working on my PTSD, but we can't quite break through the mental blocks. We know it's there, because every once in a while it try to come through in the EMDR sessions, but we can't quite get a hold of it. But we are working on the trust issues)
I also don't know where to meet guys, and I suck at online dating. Like I said, my lack of confidence during my 20's meant I missed all that social learning you're supposed to do.

But most of all, being fat has kept me safe, from the catcalls. 
From the lewd looks.
From the DMs.
From being hit on when I'm out with friends. 
From being bothered when I'm at the store. 

I mean, I'm a woman, so I'm still hyper alert and worry, but I haven't had nearly the number of experiences as others have had, because my body is not conventionally attractive.  But I'm super scared, that if I keep losing weight and getting in shape, that I'll draw attention. And I guess we just aren't far enough along in therapy for me to be okay with that.

i7vka5,TwoXSupport,1597165525.0,"That‚Äôs how it feels one some levels. Today is one year to the day since my last period. I‚Äôve hit the official milestone to leave perimenopause behind and join the ranks of the ‚Äúwhy are you even still alive?‚Äù post-menopausal. 

Growing up, menopause absolutely wasn‚Äôt discussed. It was ‚Äúshe‚Äôs going through the change‚Äù and oblique jokes about hot flashes and a line or two in Health class about menarche‚Äôs opposite number. I lost my mother when I was 15, and my grandmother had gone through surgical menopause before I was even born. I had no older family member to give me any clue at all about what to expect. 

I didn‚Äôt hear the word perimenopause until I was googling the average age of menopause (and perimenopause still isn‚Äôt even recognized by any of my spell-checkers.) I can tell you almost to the month when perimenopause started for me because I can see the changes in my period tracker app. I can see how my usually regular cycles went from 28-30 days to 15 to 45 to 10 to 100 to 30. My usually predictable and largely painless periods went from five days to seven to ten to a full month of bleeding with cramps that would wake me sobbing as my endometrial tissue decided it wanted to burrow into my uterus and stick around. I had a few hot flashes and night sweats and the mood swings were so brutal I went back into therapy to help me get a handle on my moods before I threw myself off a cliff or got on a plane to fly to another state to throttle someone who‚Äôd annoyed me in a WebEx meeting. 

I used to be so healthy that my ex-husband joked that my D&D stats would be heavily dumped into Con and Int. Now I have arthritis in both hands, I have a chronic stomach condition that has altered my diet to that of a picky kindergartner, the presbyopia is no fucking joke, I have to repeat the reason I‚Äôm walking to another room to myself over and over or I‚Äôll forget what I was going to do, and apparently all those industrial concerts without earplugs in the 90s are coming back to me in hearing loss now. All the shit I used to roll my eyes at in older people has hit my personal fan. 

I‚Äôve embraced my inner crone since I turned 40. I‚Äôm 51 now. That has inoculated me a little from our general cultural dismissal of older women, but I‚Äôm still having mild symptoms in the same way you might get a mild flu after the flu shot. I have this insidious message of what menopause looks like, and it looks a lot like my grandmother - a take no shit woman shaped like a barrel whose personal style is 30 years out of date and lies about her age. It‚Äôs not entirely inaccurate - I‚Äôm pretty take no shit and I still dress like it‚Äôs the 90s. I‚Äôm less barrel-shaped than my grandmother, but that might be partly because I haven‚Äôt had a bilateral mastectomy the way my gran had and mostly back to that chronic stomach issue. 

I still have those messages about what menopause is supposed to look like in my head. I need to look matronly and I need to bake cookies and apparently I need to get all Karen-y at people. (Sidenote: I think that menopausal Karens are taking the ‚Äútake no shit‚Äù thing the wrong way. You can take no shit without treating the other person like shit, Karens.)  I also need to pretend I‚Äôm not aging - color my hair, adjust my makeup to hide the lines (and wear makeup at all!), lie about my age, walk some weird tightrope between trying too hard and giving up. Even little things like what color I paint my nails has some age expectation attached to it. 

I am 51 years old. I have grey hair, bony hands, little white circles in my irises called arcus senilis, and my skin texture is changing in ways that I hate more than any other part of aging. 

I also have body piercings left from my eight years working as a body piercer. I have more tattoos than my millennial kid (and they still look great after 30 years). My wardrobe is still almost entirely black, and my nails are currently the most obnoxious neon I could find. I‚Äôm not ‚Äútrying too hard‚Äù because this is how I‚Äôve always been, and besides, in quarantine there‚Äôs no one to see any of this but myself. I hope that my generation, Gen X, is the last generation to head into menopause blind, which is part of why I‚Äôm word vomiting about it now. 

Many of you reading this will someday be looking at their calendar and going, ‚ÄúHuh, it‚Äôs been a year.‚Äù I hope that by then you‚Äôll have worked out your own definition of what menopause looks like. I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/i7vka5/im_officially_superfluous/,I‚Äôm officially superfluous,Other,71,13,0.96,jadefishes

Went to A&E with chest pain, coughing, pins in needles and numbness in my left hand, tremors, sweating, dizziness. I don‚Äôt think I need to tell anyone what that could mean (pretty bad). 

I wasn‚Äôt taken seriously from the get go. Left in a room with no information. Was told I just need to breathe. Lol. I was doing fucking breath work at this point. 

So I fought them. Told them I‚Äôm still having the chest pains, faintness and tingling after 2 hours of waiting and I want more tests. 

Was told to CALM DOWN. 

Was told to take a PILL to CALM DOWN. 

I‚ÄôM NOT CALM BECAUSE THIS IS A MEDICAL CONCERN AND YOU‚ÄôRE TALKING TO ME LIKE A 1950s HOUSEWIFE.

I wasn‚Äôt even looked at in the eye when being given results. All information passed directly to the man - in this case my boyfriend. From a female doctor as well!!!  

I‚Äôve had so many other shitty experiences with doctors (doesn‚Äôt matter the sexual orientation). There‚Äôs this massive unconscious bias in the whole medical industry that women are just sensitive and overreacting. 

I cannot begin to explain how damaging this is. We are overlooked as a result of ‚Äòhysteria‚Äô. They pin pain on ‚Äòit‚Äôs in your head‚Äô. 

It most certainly is not in my head. I have done the work to understand my body‚Äôs internal rythms and language beyond most could fathom. Somatic practices, embodiment, meditation, yoga, eating well, self soothing, cycle syncing, menstrual cycle tracking. I know my fucking body. And something is not okay.

wv16t2,WomensHealth,1661192737.0,"I'm posting this for anyone who is unsure or grossed out by the idea of menstral cups.
I always hated the idea of menstarl cups, I was scared about putting something in my vagina, I didn't even use tampons! 
Whenever I was on my period I couldn't do anything, I couldn't exercise, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't hang out with friends, I couldn't go into public spaces basically. I had extremely heavy flows and genuinely felt like I was cursed and the only one who went through this. I would have to put shorts and thick tights on aswell as thick dark trousers because no matter what i did and no matter how frequently I changed pads, I would ALWAYS leak. 
It really lowered my quality of life.
After some heavy convincing by a friend of mine, I decided to finally give period cups a go. 
After my first use, my life basically changed, I barely have cramps now, i don't know what happened but I sleep perfectly fine on my period and I don't need loads of pain medication anymore. I don't know the science behind it but something changed from my first go at period cups. I no longer have leaks and I forget on my period so often. I sometimes forget to empty it because I am so pain free.
My periods have gone from 8 days to 5 days and I feel like I don't have to spend a week in bed every month.

I urge anybody who hasn't tried period cups to give them a go, don't just stop at one if it feels uncomfortable, test different sizes anf brands to see which one is right for you.

They hung out alot and I didn't have many things to do so I spent time with them.

My cousin and aunt knew about it but thought it was harmless, because on the outside it really seemed so. On the inside however, he was kissing me, and romantic stuff like that, even some sexual things (I never touched him that way at all, and never initiated that or kissing). I just can't get over how stupid I was... In a way I feel groomed, which I probably was. He even tried waiting till I was 16 to 'legally' date me ( I live in NC so the laws are weird). However when I turned 16 I realized just how disgusting it was. It doesn't matter how MUCH a minor has a crush on you , you should be an adult and STEP AWAY from the situation. I feel forever guilty though, on the other hand because I feel I'm at fault. Eventually I told my aunt and cousin that he liked me like that and that I never wanted to be around him again, but they still hang out and that really hurts me. I haven't told them how he was sexual towards me so that is probably why.. but regardless I think they should stop being around each other, they weren't close friends anyways.

o2oyvq,WomensHealth,1624022501.0,"19F. This happened when I was about 16 or 17 and was working out at the gym. I noticed that there were a group of guys around my age that were circling around and looking at me. I felt uncomfortable so decided to walk to the other room (the gym has two main rooms separated by a hallway. One is big whereas the other one is small and has more climbing stuff). I thought it would be a good idea to go to the small room because it would be obvious if they were still following me if they came in there. I was on this climbing treadmill sort of machine when one of the guys approached my machine and was staring at me. I had headphones in and ignored it at first. Then he was saying something and I couldn‚Äôt stop moving on the machine to hear, I had to get off. He was asking me if I had a bf and I honestly don‚Äôt remember what I said, but I think I said no in a naive sort of way. He asked me to come out into the hallway with him because he wanted to tell me something and it was too loud. I said no and was hesitant, but then agreed to. 


In the hallway (it was in a corner where no one else was) he was begging me to kiss him and was begging for my Snapchat or number, and I said no. I was trying to get back into the room, but he was blocking my way and said only if I kissed him first. I said I could hug him but that was it. So I hugged him, but he pulled me in close and grabbed my butt, and was breathing on/trying to kiss my neck. I felt shocked and pushed him away, giving him an evil stare and then walking out of the gym. On the way out I heard him catching up with his group of friends and laughing. His group of friends seem to have been cheering him on.


I know this wasn‚Äôt right of that guy to do, but I don‚Äôt really consider it something as far as sexual assault. I hadn‚Äôt talked about it or told anyone until recently, when they told me it was, and that I should have told someone at the gym. I did think about telling someone at the gym in the moment, but I also felt like I didn‚Äôt want to ruin this young guys life or get him in trouble for that. I also feel like it isn‚Äôt right to qualify this as sexual assault when so many other people have experienced much worse and traumatic things, such as r*pe. This event hasn‚Äôt effected me so much or traumatized me or anything, but I did leave the gym feeling objectified and confused, and I have had fears sexually with partners which might be due to an accumulation of things like this.

Obviously, that's not how things have gone. I've been a committed relationship with my boyfriend for a while now. Both of us were virgins when we began the relationship, and throughout the course of it, have been having consensual, loving, and protected sex. 

A couple days ago, my family was not supposed to be home, so I invited my bf over in my room to hang out. The door was locked. We started messing around (foreplay), but were extremely quiet. My mom came home, picked the lock (she doesn't like it when I lock my door), and saw us together. Since then, she told my younger sister about it and no one will speak to me at home. 

She said what I did was worse than murder, and that she can never trust me again. She was disgusted that we were doing ""stuff"" while I was on my period. She called my boyfriend a sexual deviant, that he was only using me for sex. My sister (age 15) refuses to speak to me as she thinks I'm giving away my body. But further, she told me that no matter how much protection we use, I can get pregnant, and if I do, my life will be over. 

I need some support to know whether my decisions are healthy or not. I would also appreciate some resources regarding discreet and reliable birth control options (IUD, implants... etc.) that are affordable for two college students.

While I met with the Urologist he said that he needed to check my cervix.. I did not want to experience the pain again so I just did as he asked. He proceeded to tell me after that I just need to drink a lot of lemonade. Now that I'm thinking about it... There was no real reason for him to do that.

Been to a few different doctors and have done lots of tests (hormones, STI, BV, YI, Mycoplasma, Eureoplasma. We‚Äôve debates testing mold but the test is so expensive and the last doctor said it didn‚Äôt seem like that was the case) but everything comes back within normal limits. I‚Äôve cried on multiple exam tables with my legs in the stirrups as doctors talk to me about things I could do that I either already do, have done and they don‚Äôt work or things I wish I could do but struggle because my mental illness (ie: ‚ÄúYou could eat ______ and exercise‚Äù ahhh, yes, trust me, if I could exercise more I would because the weight I‚Äôve gained is wrecking me and I‚Äôm exhausted constantly. I also would love to eat more diverse foods but with lots of foods I take a bite and feel like there are bugs in my mouth and that‚Äôs hell on earth. I would like to do those things too).

I‚Äôve taken some metronidazole (which messes with my lithium and makes me head feel like it is going to crack in half), I have been doing 2x week metronidazole gel for just over a year now, probiotics, I‚Äôm so careful about what I‚Äôm doing to the point where I don‚Äôt even take baths/swim/hot tub anymore which is a bummer. Boric acid doesn‚Äôt help a ton and it‚Äôs messy and I don‚Äôt feel like I can have sex with that either because it leaves little white stuff for a day or so after and if I was ok with stuff coming out of me I wouldn‚Äôt be so anxious about the BV. My clothing has changed and at times it even effects what I‚Äôm able to do because I feel too uncomfortable with it. I take a low dose of doxycycline &amp; spironolactone for my skin (which is terrible off meds) and I‚Äôm positive the doxycycline is part of the problem (when though I was taking it before this all started) but when I go off of it my skin gets so bad I wouldn‚Äôt be having sex either because it effects my confidence so bad. I‚Äôve got body dysmorphia and stopped going out socially because of acne and weight gain before COVID, if my acne was worse I don‚Äôt think I would be comfortable with video chats or even going into the office (I have perioral dermatitis that is triggered by my makeup so I can‚Äôt even cover it up).

Sex was one of the few things in my life that was easy and made me feel good. My mental health is rough so it was nice to be able to have that. Now I get anxious and panicky when someone starts kissing me because there is a chance it‚Äôs going to maybe lead to genital contact of some kind and then I‚Äôm going to feel gross until the BV is triggered. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôll ever be comfortable with oral/digital sex again (which sucks because I am bi).

My doctors/therapist/psychiatrist are also aware it triggers my suicidal ideation and while I‚Äôm no threat to myself and have zero plans on acting on it- I hate that I‚Äôm 31 and this is going to be the rest of my life. From what I‚Äôve seen, BV is fickle to treat. I don‚Äôt know why this is happening.

I don't really know how to start this, as I keep feeling angry and frustrated. This is about the game World of Warcraft. With their new expansion, Shadowlands, one of the NPC's you interact with is trans. And I personally think that's awesome. One small step closer for a game being more inclusive is great.

But, unfortunately, this has lead to a lot of toxic and misogynistic comments. Some friends saw this happen in game chat last night, and I saw it today under an article on twitter. I've been reporting tweets and accounts for like an hour, and the disgusting comments keep coming.

I just don't really know what else I can do, and it makes me feel helpless, and angry. Why are these people so dense, is their ego so fragile, that one NPC is enough for them to turn into full blown cry babies, when this one time the game doesn't cater to their needs? How hard can it be to just let people have someone they can look up to or identify with, when these ""gamers"" have been getting that for decades? How is this ruining their immersion, in a fantasy game, where literally everything is possible? I seriously just don't understand.

So I thought I would share my experience for people who may be considering what to do about their condition.

&#x200B;

I've had severe vaginismus since I first tried to put in a tampon when I was 13. I've never experienced sexual trauma, but I have had lifelong anxiety. I probably trained my muscles to clench even more when I tried to ""force it"" at a young age and ended up hurting myself more. Then, after I started taking anxiety medication, I no longer had panic attacks when I tried but it was too late-- I had trained my muscles to reject all penetration.

After speaking to many health professionals it was recommended to me that I have a vestibulectomy (skin removed from just inside of the entrance of the vagina) because those muscles were the worst, and receive botox injections. My case was so bad that physical therapy was not going to be productive whatsoever by itself. I had the surgery a month ago and I had the injections this morning, and I'm lying in bed recovering from it now.

I haven't tried to put in my first dilator yet, but I've been putting half of my index finger in my vagina for over two weeks now to apply estrogen cream to the wound, and I could never have imagined doing that before my surgery. I almost cried in relief after I did it the first time. It was so easy, and almost completely painless (after all, I still have stitches down there), after years of pain and stress. After the botox kicks in the results will probably be even more dramatic! 

Ask me anything about the procedures or the recovery I've had so far. I was under general anesthesia for the vestibulectomy but not for the botox injections. The healing wound and getting the botox injections hurt like a bitch, but nothing has compared to the pain of penetration pre-surgery, so I was kind of over it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/ho7fzk/ask_me_anything_i_had_vaginal_surgery_and_botox/,Ask Me Anything: I had vaginal surgery and botox injections for severe vaginismus,Resource,66,13,0.99,Wooden_Lingonberry65

We‚Äôre a part of a sociological research project looking into the failures of healthcare systems in providing the help we seek from them. 

We want to create a space to bring people together and share their negative medical encounters. These can range from stories about long journeys towards diagnosis, denial of  treatment, invalidation, gaslighting and lack of speciality doctors available. 

We then plan on reading these comments on our podcast (with your permission) and having discussions with a range of healthcare professionals to try and unpack these experiences, and offer comfort and solutions. 

If you have a story you‚Äôd like to share, please post below. We won‚Äôt use your story without direct permission so it won‚Äôt go further than this forum without you knowing about it. Also please note that this is fully supervised by our university supervisor, and any comments discussed will be completely anonymous. We look forward to hearing from you!

The past two years I had months of continuing bleeding every day. Finally I found a doctor recently who is actually listening to me and suggested I get a hysterectomy considering my disorder, how bad everything was the first two years of my period and all the problems up until now. Not to mention how mentally exhausted And riddled with anxiety I have been since I got my period at 11. I‚Äôm 21 now. 
Anyway she wants me to try getting a progestin only IUD to ‚Äúexhaust all our efforts‚Äù and the surgeon said he wanted me to try it before he would talk with me about  a hysterectomy. 
I don‚Äôt want an IUD for a few reasons, 1. I truly don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to help I‚Äôm definitely concerned about progestin only having the reverse effect of stopping my bleeding. And I don‚Äôt wanna have to go through another 6 months - a year of this just to say ‚Äúnope it still didn‚Äôt work‚Äù.

3. Due to my disorder I worry about perforation.

I feel crazy for not wanting to get the IUD but I also feel like I know my body the best and that I should be listened to. 
How do I go about getting them on the same page as I am? I really think a hysterectomy is the right call for me for so many reasons. But I‚Äôm worried that if I don‚Äôt get the IUD that I will never get where I need and want to be. AKA happy with my life and my body.

I have been having high grade abnormal/precancerous cell growth show up on my paps for 10 years now. I had a LEEP procedure done 4 years ago, and side note my right ovary was removed due to rupturing & precancerous cysts at age 6.

For the past 2 months I have had some concerning symptoms show up.... pain after/during sex, some irregular spotting & heavy periods and abnormal discharge/odor. Now I regularly get cysts and pelvic pain on my remaining ovary, but it has been far worse and very consistent since October. And the past week, that pain has also been felt through the kidney region. I‚Äôm far more exhausted and generally sore than usual. I have been uncomfortably and oftentimes painfully bloated for a full month now (little to no give), especially when I try to eat. I have to urinate all the dang time. And I think lastly and weirdly- when I cut my nails the past few weeks, they grow back curved and minorly clubbed. Not horrendously so, but it is definitely noticeable. 

I had an ultrasound a couple weeks ago to check my ovary for tumors, and everything was ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù I go in for a colposcopy/biopsy and some blood tests late next week, and I‚Äôm just ready for some answers and direction.

hdk0lo,WomensHealth,1592794886.0,"With the pandemic going on, I had to do eCare when I had a yeast infection back in March. I received care from a doctor who is not my primary gynecologist and she was really judgmental. 

She started by asking me the routine questions such as are you sexually active, are you on birth control, what is the sex of your partners, etc. 

I answered her questions, mentioning that I am sexually active and sometimes the guy I‚Äôm dating doesn‚Äôt wear a condom. Sometimes we risk it and use the ‚Äúpull out‚Äù method which we know can lead to pregnancy considering i‚Äôm not on birth control. 

The gyno was so passive aggressive and let it be known she disproves. She said something like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not trying to get pregnant but yet you don‚Äôt always use a condom?‚Äù in a snarky tone. And when I answered yes, she hesitated before saying ‚Äúwell okay‚Äù and I could just feel the eye roll behind it even though I couldn‚Äôt see her. 

Obv I know pregnancy is a risk from not using any contraceptives. But I‚Äôve also talked about it with my partner, we have talked about the risks and have made plans if anything happens. Sure we aren‚Äôt married, but we both want kids someday and are financially and emotionally stable if I did fall pregnant soon. 

I‚Äôve tried birth control in the past, different types, and I did not personally like them. I use fertility awareness methods such as the calendar method, temp checks, which I know aren‚Äôt as effective as other contraceptives but it‚Äôs also MY choice, MY body, and no one else‚Äôs. And I know it will also be my responsibility if I get pregnant and that‚Äôs fine. 

Maybe I‚Äôm overreacting but I feel like she could have approached it differently. I‚Äôm a nurse, and I make sure to hide all biases and just educate my patients without judgement.

Every time I have pain that is unbearable or express my constant symptoms, I am given high dose ibuprofen, a switch to my birth control, and told that surgery would be OVERKILL.

Literally had a cyst rupture and hemorrhage for the second time in 2 months. I went to the ER cus it was unbearable. I follow up with my gyno yesterday and he literally tells me surgery would be overkill cus my cyst is only 4cm.. 

I am so tired of doctors invalidating my experience. When I feel I SHOULD have the laprscopic done, it's like they're reading my mind, and before I can even mention it they bring it up themselves and say ""overkill"". 

I am hurt deeply by this industry. I have had crippling pain, that is now progressed to outside of my bleed period. I have been socially crippled by severe hormonal acne. I have a bloat that won't go away even on a 5 day fast, that makes me feel heavy/uncomfy and have poor body image. I have nausea and loss of appetite, and I often have to smoke weed just to feel hungry. But on the flip side I have dealt with uncontrollable food binges as well where I can't eat enough carbs or sugar (insulin resistance issues).

I have had friend nurses study my blood work and point out red flags that my doc finds no concern over.

lbaq3u,TwoXSupport,1612311325.0,"This is driving me crazy. My boyfriend works at a small health tech startup in the U.S. He's one of their more senior level staff members, although not executive level. He insists these people aren't Trump supporters (and even told me I was being offensive for suggesting they might be). But nonetheless, they seem dedicated to the idea of taking zero COVID precautions. My boyfriend is working for the company remotely, from several states away. But the ones who work near the office come in regularly. They don't wear masks in the office, or when they go out to eat indoors together. They don't have special ventilation in the office. They don't require testing. Nothing.

They also apparently like to have big quarterly meetings where they fly everyone else in the company from around the country into the office, so they can have a big two-day meeting indoors in a small office with no one wearing masks, and going out to eat in the local restaurants in the evenings with no one wearing masks, indoors.

My boyfriend and I have been following CDC guidelines nearly all year. He has even stated he would prefer I not ride in the car with my friends when we were all wearing masks and the windows were down (we talked about possibly carpooling). But he gets defensive whenever I say that I think his coworkers' attitude and total lack of precautions is ridiculous. He says things like ""some people just have different risk-taking levels than others"" and he also does some whataboutism, like saying that since we've done a bit of traveling this year it's the same thing (I totally disagree - we've followed CDC guidelines regarding masks, only eating at restaurants outdoors, etc. everywhere we've gone).

It came up again recently because he mentioned they want him to fly out in a few weeks. Since we've had this conversation before about how I think their lack of precautions is ridiculous, and I now feel that way even more so since it's the middle of winter and infection rates are high as ever, and he seemed cool as a cucumber while telling me this, it turned into a big blowout fight.

It wound up with me giving some constructive suggestions, like suggesting he look for other companies that feel in-person meetings are necessary to their functioning, and see what kinds of safety precautions they're taking and suggest to his boss that they institute some of those as a policy. But I kind of resent the fact that no one at this company, including my boyfriend, is taking the initiative to suggest these things themselves. And I also feel like at the first sign of resistance he's probably going to roll over about it, because he's self-described conflict-averse, especially when it comes to work buddies. But like, how is this so different than him telling me he's going to go to an orgy where no one is wearing protection? I just feel so frustrated right now.

Tell me ladies, how would you handle this? Would this similarly drive you crazy? Any thing else you might suggest for me?

UPDATE: So we talked things through. He's not going to go to this meeting (his manager said he doesn't have to go). In the future if he has to go to something we'll adopt the quarantine approach when he gets back, I think.

Hi, first time posting here. I'm not sure where else to go at this point. Talking to my family feels bad because I know they are hurting too and I don't want to add to their pain. Talking to my partner is great but he doesn't really understand and I am kind of scared of coming off as insane to him. 

My older sister died last May. She was 26. She was fighting with her abusive boyfriend while he was driving and she was \*somehow\* thrown from the vehicle. They said she might have jumped out to get away from him. She died later that night. I lived across the country so I couldn't get there until days later bc of covid. I hadn't seen her in months - since Christmas. I could have never imagined that the next time I would be seeing her would be her funeral. I did talk to her on the phone about a week before. In retrospect, I am grateful that we had that last talk because it was rare that we would communicate like that. 

We did not have the best relationship for a long time. My sister had a lot of issues. She was raped as a teenager and I think it just destroyed her. She had a mental break down at 17 and wound up in the psych ward shortly after. I remember my mom taking me and my twin sister to see her. She didn't know who we were. After this, she was in one abusive relationship after another. She was an addict. She could be terrible and violent when she was using. I hated her so much then. She was abusive and I really can't excuse the trauma she put my through as an adolescent, but I wonder if she would have gotten into drugs if she wasn't victimized in the way that she was. And she was a good older sister before. I feel like I can't even talk to anyone in my life about this because they all know her as this horrible person who was awful to me but she wasn't always like that. I loved her so much when I was little. She used to take the cushions off the couch and let my sister and I sleep-over on her floor and play video games. And then she was assaulted and she was never the same. 

She had two kids. My little nephews. One of them had just turned one year old when she passed. He will never know his mother. My parents are fighting like hell to adopt her kids. The hardest part of this has been seeing what it has done to my mother. She never deserved this. Even when everyone gave up on my sister, my mom was there for her. This used to infuriate me when I was younger. Now it just breaks my heart so much. I cannot even fathom her grief and the thoughts of it quite literally crushes me. 

I guess I am having a bad night if it's not obvious by now.  I don't know even know what brings it on sometimes. Ever since she passed, I have been a wreck but trying to keep it under control. My anxiety is a million times worse than before and I am constantly thinking about death. Not like I want to die, but I am so scared of it and I wonder all the time what my sister felt when she was dying. I can't even listen to sad songs without going to a terribly dark place. My mind literally feels like a prison. I don't know how to make it stop because she is never coming back. 

I have looked up her rapists on Facebook. One of them is married and has a family. I fantasize about sending his wife a message about what he did to my sister when they were teenagers. I want to ask them if they heard that she passed. I want them to feel the pain I feel. I am so angry sometimes at these men I feel like I could kill them. I want everyone to know what fucked up people they are. Why do they get to live their lives when my sister is dead? 

I work as peer educator around sexual violence and IPV at my college. No one I work with knows about my sister. I don't want anyone to feel bad for me and I don't want it to interfere with my work although I worry it does anyway. 

I am just so distraught. I knew this would be hard to deal with but it's been almost a year and I still feel so torn up. I wonder if I will ever be okay again. 

I love and miss my sister every day. I think about her and the circumstances of her death constantly. I used to wish that she would die because she was suffering mentally so much it made her act in horrible ways. But I know she was in more pain than I can imagine. I just wish I could talk to her one last time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/lfuwae/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_all_of_this_anger_and/,I don't know what to do with all of this anger and grief.,Support - Advice Welcome,62,6,0.98,panicked-honk

I pee before and after sex. I take cranberry and Vitamin C and Probiotics everyday for the past two months. And when I drink three pints of cranberry juice every day it really helps with the UTI symptoms. Pain when I pee and after subsides.
And the courses of antibiotics did help but they were only four days long and I told the doctor I needed a longer course as I was just feeling the ends of the UTI so she gave me a five day course. Really I would like a 7 day course.

I spoke to my doctor this morning, after getting my urine test back, saying that it was negative and I do not have a UTI and that the pain that I ""experienced didn't exist because I don't have a UTI."" WHAT?! I was crippled in pain on the kitchen floor after I peed and that just didn't happen? I made it all up? I love taking antibiotics and feeling crap all day? Yeah right. 

So now I'm getting an STD/STI test tomorrow and I am so angry. I do not have an STI. I am worried now that my UTI will turn into a Kidney infection if I am refused antibiotics. I am so sad and frustrated and I don't know what to do. I'm crying as I'm writing this. I have had the worst two months with this pain and now I'm not being believed and being accused of having an STD which is just impossible unless two virgins can create an STD from nothing.

jaqoke,WomensHealth,1602637462.0,"Hey guys! 

some of you may remember me from my posts about how nervous I was for my first Pap smear. It literally gave me the worst anxiety I ever had! 

I had a phone appointment with my dr yesterday and she saw how upset I was and decided to take me in THE SAME DAY even though my appointment was the 22nd. She said she was only doing phone appointments and would make an exception for me so we could get it over with. I had brought my mom for support, and they were not allowed to let her in because of COVID, so my dr‚Äôs assistant pretended she was a patient in order for me to have her in the room. 

The whole experience was NOTHING like I imagined. I never felt exposed or like I was spread open for the world to see. Nothing felt cold like many have told me, and she used a small speculum without me even asking (I am also 5‚Äù3 124 lbs so this may differ for everyone). She showed me and guided me through everything she was going to do and then she was done. And I mean she was DONE. I swear I didn‚Äôt feel the speculum at all and I also barely even felt the brush. People who had described it to me as what it feels like to touch the inside of your belly button were most accurate, but it was barely even a feeling for the 5 seconds that she did it. I think if I wasn‚Äôt nervous and was doing something on my phone, I wouldn‚Äôt have felt anything at all. 

I did have very slight cramping and bleeding afterwards, but it wasn‚Äôt enough to affect my mood or be significant. I just took a shower and then went out to dinner with my family. 

I hope this can ease someone‚Äôs mind if they are about to get their first exam. Please do not listen to every thing you see online; it is way more helpful if you talk to someone in person that you trust like a mom, aunt, or older sister. Talk to your doctor thoroughly and switch doctors if they are not understanding with your concerns.

A couple of his friends are having kids and some people I know from school are as well. I can't wrap my head around it because of the lifestyle I live. I'm currently in college and I graduate in May 2024. I'm graduating a year early by the way, and am currently working my way towards law school. Anyway, I'd like to mention I go to Christian college, and if I got married I would not be able to live on campus, so there's no way I'll have a child from now until I graduate. 
As I was saying, I don't get how some people are having kids at my age. My sister (24) has two kids and it seems like she wishes she waited sometimes. It seems like being a mom is so hard. And social media makes it seem like being a mom is the hardest job on earth. 
I am so stressed because I am getting married next year, and although l'll be on birth control, I am worried that I'll end up pregnant before I'm 30. Ideally, I'd like to have a house and career before I have kids. I'll graduate law school when I'm around 25 and although me and my man are saving for a house, I am not entirely sure we will be financially ready to have a kid before 30. The last thing I want is to be  struggling to sustain my child. Growing up poor was no joke, so I want them to live comfortably. 
How do I get over this fear? And why do I feel so insane and irrational about it? So many people in Christian culture press on having a lot of kids and young but that seems so scary to me. Honestly I just want so badly to have kids when I'm older, once I'm mature and stable. Any advice on how to prevent pregnancy for real? Like 100%... I know birth control is mostly helpful but it stresses me out that I wouldn't have an abortion either since there'd be no point since I'd be married. And it wouldn't happen regardless since I'm Christian. Anyway, I guess this is just a rant mostly but that is my biggest fear. I don't know if I should just limit sex or just pray extra hard. Jk, but any scientific help to reduce the chances to nearly 100% no pregnancy? I really don't want kids until I'm older.

ydxf7q,WomensHealth,1666788849.0,"Hi, this is embarrassing and i hate to ask but there‚Äôs nothing else for me to do and i‚Äôve been panicked over this since i was 10.  

Im 17 and almost 18 and I‚Äôve met this boy that I really like and i‚Äôve never had a boyfriend before. He‚Äôs going to stay at my house and we‚Äôre being allowed to sleep in the same bed so I think we‚Äôre going to have sex (my first time). 

The problem is that im pretty sure there‚Äôs something wrong with my vagina or I don‚Äôt know how to take care of it. My mother never taught me a lot about hygiene and she once brought me into the bathroom to teach me how to wash my vagina and she made me watch her. She basically just sucked up water into her vagina and pushed it out and she told me that was what I should do. So I did that but it ended up making it very easy for water to get up there so if I went into a pool or even the filthy ocean the water would just start going up and so I stopped doing it because I had dirty sea water go up there and it terrified me. I started looking up how I should clean it and i saw something that said I should be cleaning the outside with water. I try to do that when I shower but my mum doesn‚Äôt let me use washcloths so I have to just use a shower and my hands. But our shower-head is dirty and i try to clean it but it doesn‚Äôt work and there‚Äôs still stuff there. My mum is fine with it being dirty because she takes baths so she doesn‚Äôt need to use it but it makes me panic because I get so scared of infections and I feel dirty all the time and end up crying when I shower sometimes. My mum also buys luxury products for herself sometimes but I can only use basic soap which also makes me feel dirty and like i‚Äôm not a proper girl and I can‚Äôt do girl things because I can‚Äôt get things like my nails and eyebrows done as well like my friends do but i understand that and wouldn‚Äôt expect my mum to go out of her way to possibly give me money or take me to her appointments. 

Also I think my underwear is a problem because i‚Äôve heard you should wear cotton underwear but my mum would buy me a weird material which sort of reminded me of a swimsuit and I‚Äôve thrown them out now because I noticed it made the smell very strong so I got new ones but they‚Äôre still a different material but it‚Äôs only because my mum forces me to wear unattractive underwear because she says she doesn‚Äôt want me looking like a slut but these things are SO SO ugly and thick and they‚Äôre HIGH WAISTED so I can‚Äôt wear low rise trousers or crop tops. I‚Äôve sort of fixed this problem because I brought myself cotton underwear and my friend stole me 3 thongs because I was the only girl she knew that didn‚Äôt have any. My mum tries to throw them away but I‚Äôm protecting them and my new clothes that are actually girl clothes instead of my older brothers old clothes. 

But here‚Äôs the main problem. There‚Äôs multiple things I think are wrong with my vagina. I often think I have an infection because there‚Äôs a smell. It‚Äôs been this way since i was 11 and it smells strong and it‚Äôs definitely a strong odor but i personally don‚Äôt think it smells bad but i know from someone else‚Äôs perspective it might. I also have yellow discharge sometimes. At some points it‚Äôs white or clear but there‚Äôs times it‚Äôs been yellow and it‚Äôs just random but i notice it‚Äôs usually before or after my period. But i feel like it‚Äôs just wrong. It never itches which i know is a sign of infection but i‚Äôve never had that unless i‚Äôve shaved. It also doesn‚Äôt taste good like I‚Äôve received oral sex before and they‚Äôve chosen to do it again and i asked if it tastes weird and she said it tastes like a vagina and it‚Äôs an organ so she doesn‚Äôt expect it to taste like skittles. And she said it was fine but of course there‚Äôs the taste of sweat and stuff but I had just showered but she kept doing it and seemed to enjoy it. But i got forced to finger myself in front of some older man a couple months ago and he made me taste it and i hated the way it tasted and i didn‚Äôt go to the police so he kept doing it along with other stuff so I started thinking the taste was weird and eventually i had to just run and hide from him. 

But also I feel like after a full day my underwear looks so weird when they‚Äôre dirty so i will wash them in the sink before throwing them in the laundry basket. I tried to fix the smell by going to the toilet to pee and then wiping normally and then getting wet toilet paper and putting water on it and then drying it with more toilet paper. But then I started getting scared if I was putting any bacteria from the tap on it and I don‚Äôt know if I should keep doing that or not. My mum originally taught me to wipe back to front like from the vagina hole to the front of the vulva but I stopped doing that years ago and now i go the other way. 

Also I have a lot of blemishes on my buttcheeks and i don‚Äôt know if that will go away. It‚Äôs only noticeable up close but i hate it. I hope it‚Äôs like my face where i think i have horrific acne but i get compliments on my clear skin. I think i have major body image issues so I could just be obsessive and imaginative. But i just feel like all other women are smooth and pretty and perfect and i‚Äôm like an imposter to dare align myself with women-hood because i‚Äôm like some sort of pig that will be alone forever. 

Also i swear it looks weird because I have an outie and i thought it was meant to be pink but it‚Äôs brown and pink and the area around it is darker as well as between my buttcheeks is darker. My mum always told me that one day ill want a labia reduction because she had one and men will make fun of me for it. She also once watched me in the shower and made fun of the size of my nipples but i didn‚Äôt know they were too big so I don‚Äôt know if i should be worried about that too. 

I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve left anything out and if you read this thank you and please say something if you can.

xmxfok,WomensHealth,1664037317.0,"Update 9/30/22: my insurance rejected the claim because of the hospitals ruling of nonemergency. I'll be calling the hospital billing department and putting my Karen pants on, because I was told by my insurance that the hospital can call the insurance company directly and tell them it was an emergency to change the amount owed. I hate the fact I'll probably have to threaten to sue if they won't change it. I don't want to get law involved but I'm so tired of this, and I cannot afford 8k medical bills.

Original post:

Why would a hospital bill my emergency room visit as a non-emergency? I (f19) went to the emergency room because of extreme pain in my ovary. My insurance will cover emergency room visits out of network, but doesn‚Äôt cover other visits out of network. This hospital was out of network, but I went as an emergency, so it should have been covered regardless (I‚Äôve already checked this with insurance). At a previous ER visit, I had a doctor tell me that since my ovarian cysts were large, they could cause torsion. The explanation I was given was that my ovary could become twisted, and the twist would prevent blood from reaching the ovary essentially, causing the ovary to die and for me to become infertile. This was all in a time before I had a local OBGYN because I had just moved to my city. I took what the doctor said seriously, and visited another ER when I experienced a terrible amount of pain and nausea. 

At the hospital, I told them what the previous doctor had said. They did an ultrasound and didn't find the ovary that was in pain. I was scared out of my mind, and nobody was explaining that this was a common occurrence when blocked by gas. It was not explained to me that torsion was rare and that I probably didn‚Äôt need another hospital visit. None of that was explained to me. If you don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening, I think it is pretty valid to believe you‚Äôre facing an emergency. I just can‚Äôt understand why the hospital would have charged someone who was terrified of losing an ovary $7900 for what is practically an ultrasound and an IV of pain medication. 

I didn‚Äôt receive a bill until recently to my email, and it is going to be overdue and sent to collections in three weeks. I have three weeks to have the appeal that I faxed to insurance be processed. I have three weeks until I either have to pay $7900 or be in debt (if the appeal doesn‚Äôt work).

Deleting period trackers isn't enough.

Ok...I work in data analytics.  I spend a bunch of time making predictive models usable for the average Joe.  I do this for a not-for-profit, for the greater good of people.

That said - predictive analytics is a nightmare coming out of the ""Supreme Court"" ruling last week.

I don't know if you remember a story that made a splash back in 2012...but a store chain got really good at predicting pregnancy.  So much so that a man came in to yell at a store manager because they were sending his teenage daughter coupon books for pregnancy and baby items...only to find out a couple of weeks later that his daughter was pregnant.

The store could predict, based on changes in shopping behaviors, your likelihood of pregnancy with a greater than 80% accuracy... in 2012 (that means that if they said you were likely to be pregnant, they were right 80% of the time...that's not the same thing as catching 80% of all pregnancies).

We have so many more ways to mine data than we did in 2012.

You might need to start paying cash, with a mask on and leaving your cellphone at home.  Some of your shopping changes can tell retailers that you're pregnant before YOU know.

u5qqos,TwoXSupport,1650213355.0,"Sorry if this is written terribly, I suck at writing and expressing my thoughts. Also, sorry if it's long.

I'll begin this with saying I have a lot of social anxiety, I struggle to keep up friendships and avoid talking to strangers in person where I can.

I pushed myself to go out today because it's warm in the UK, I wanted to try read outside with an iced coffee. 
I went to my local park, opened my book, didn't even read a word before I was approached by an older man who started asking me what my ethnicity is and talking to me about his life.

I noticed this man before, riding behind me on a bike way before I got to the park, I dismissed him. Now I've reflected on it, I'm concerned he followed me but I can't be sure.

I eventually found a way out of the encounter, and left. I should have probably been more assertive sooner but I am so awkward I find it hard to even talk to people. He tried to ask for my phone number. I was firm and said no, which left me feeling quite shakey.

This is an area very close to where I live, now I feel unable to return.

su0n0l,WomensHealth,1645030452.0,"So I called my Dr a few weeks ago asking to have the copper IUD placed and they told me it would need to be ordered. Sure thing. Called yesterday since it's been 5 weeks and I've heard nothing. Drs office told me my insurance denied it because it's a medical device and not a pharmacy item. I would need to go somewhere that has iuds as stock on hand basically. So I called my insurance since birth control is supposed to be 100% covered and found out the Dr was submitting the claim incorrectly. They gave me a number for the Drs office to call and they would help submit the claim. 

Well, my Drs office told me they knew it was being submitted incorrectly, but the Dr doesn't like going through insurance since they don't reimburse her claims correctly and she loses money. Mind you, she does accept my insurance and I've been with her for over 2years, she delivered my last baby 6months ago. So instead of the Dr ordering the device for the office, doing the procedure, then billing insurance for the procedure and the device (which is the correct way for insurance to cover birth control), she is asking me as the patient to pay for the device out of pocket directly to the office (the device is $1000) and then she would submit the claim correctly and when she is reimbursed she would pay me back. So even though my insurance covers birth control I would have to pay for it out of pocket up front....

Does this sound correct to anyone? I'm going to contact my insurance again today and alert them of her protocol. This seems super shady and just wrong to me. The other piece of this is when I contacted my insurance they couldn't find a denied claim or any evidence of a claim being submitted to them, and when I questioned the office they couldn't provide anything either. So I'm assuming they aren't even trying to use my insurance knowing that it is covered.

Update: so insurance suggested I file a grievance with them so they can investigate as she is contracted with them. They also suggested I submit a complaint to the medical board. I am looking for a new Dr, which sucks but I can't see dealing with these type of rules long term. As most ob/gyns in my area are very busy I can't get established as a new patient this year, so Planned Parenthood it is.  It's horrible that I  trusted her during very vulnerable times in my life and this is how she actually treats women.

p728h2,WomensHealth,1629326988.0,"I am a 16 year old who‚Äôs been experiencing rapid weight gain over the past 18 months. 

For a bit of background, I hit puberty at an incredibly early age at 6 and I got my first period by 8. To slow this down, I was given 3 doses of lupron in mid 2018. This stopped my period all together and successfully slowed things down. The lupron eventually ‚Äògot out of my system‚Äô the following year in 2019, even then I still didn‚Äôt have my period. I was given the mini pill to try and get this back, there I started to have immobilising period cramps, lots of acne and eventually, after 3 months on that pill, bucket loads of blood. 

In late 2019, I started to gain tons of weight, I started at 55kg (121lbs), then the next month i was 56kg (123lbs), by Christmas I was 58kg (128lbs) and by New Year‚Äôs I was 59kg (130lbs). That all happened over the course of 3 months. Initially, I didn‚Äôt think much of it but when the first lockdown hit I started to get really concerned. By March, I was 65kg (143lbs). This next part contains mention of a suicide attempt and drug use so if you don‚Äôt want to read it, then you might just have to scroll past this post. 

I had attempted to end my life through the means overdosing in late April, I remember they weighed me and I was 71kg (156lbs). I had to drink charcoal to get the drugs, which were my medication, out of my system. Instead of vomiting it up like I had done before, I pooped it out which meant that I had pooped out everything good stomach bacteria I had. The following 3 months, I hadn‚Äôt dramatically changed much weight-wise because I was barely eating, I simply couldn‚Äôt tolerate it. I went from 71kg (156lbs) to 74kg (163lbs)

After that, I decided to take up weightlifting and general gym-going. Even with exercise and healthy eating, I still gained weight. I went from 74kg (163lbs) to 77kg (169lbs). By the anniversary of my overdose I was 81kg (178lbs). I should mentioned that I also had trouble with digestion, I was temporarily lactose and gluten intolerant. I had cycles of constipation and diarrhoea right until around October 2020. My digestion is better now, but it‚Äôs not like it was. 

I dropped out of school in May 2021 to get treatment for my mental health, by then i was 84kg (185lbs). I haven‚Äôt been doing much since then as I‚Äòve been mostly having smaller incidents, barely sleeping, experiencing breathing issues, having no energy and rarely exercising due to the breathing issues and lack of energy. Because of this, I‚Äôve gone from 84kg (185lbs) to 93kg (202lbs) in 3 months. It has gotten to the point where I gain a whole kilogram in 2 days. I am aware of weight fluctuation but this is not what it is.

I‚Äôve gone to my male GP on many occasions and he has dismissed my plead for a referral to a specialist time and time again. I‚Äôve gone to a gynaecologist and all she‚Äôs recommended to me is a stupid pill. I‚Äôve begged for help but nothing happens. If I ask for more than the appalling ‚Äòhelp‚Äô they have given me, I am told that I am ungrateful and that I don‚Äôt anything, even though I know myself best. I should also mention that I am 161cm (5‚Äù3), this has barely changed since 2018, I was 157cm (5‚Äù1.5) back then. I should also mention that that I am currently on 40mg of fluoxetine, 7.5mg of mirtazapine, an iron tablet for iron deficiency, fish oil and pre-pro biotics. This also hasn‚Äôt changed much over the years, except for a few mg of levetiracetam in 2018, ever-changing birth control and the addition of mirtazapine and lisdexamfetamine.

I really need help. My mental health, energy, self-confidence and self-worth is crashing because of this. I have just gotten jeans 2 days ago and they don‚Äôt fit me.

UPDATE: i went to my gynaecologist and she diagnosed me endometriosis. she said i‚Äôm at risk of developing PCOS but because i‚Äôm on the pill it‚Äôd be hard to diagnose. she‚Äôs also referred me to an endocrinologist for my hormone imbalance as well as a dietician for my eating. she also supports my choice to change GPs, in fact, she‚Äôs referred me to one in my area. i am both happy and sad, happy that there‚Äôs things that will be and that there‚Äôs a name to my problems but sad that i actually have these problems. i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôve already mentioned this, but i have a psychiatrist appointment on monday. there they will assess my medication and change as needed. i‚Äôll request for some that don‚Äôt trigger as much weight gain",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/p728h2/ive_gone_from_59kg_130lbs_to_93kg_202lbs_in_18/,I‚Äôve gone from 59kg (130lbs~) to 93kg (202lbs) in 18 months,Question,62,29,0.97,kmrtfcmsk

1) birth control doesn't regulate my periods. I am still not menstruating in the off weeks.

2) that's not an answer its a bandaid.

3) 3/4 weeks in the month I'm in a state of PMS. I'm always bloaded, broken out in acne, emotional, exhausted, crampy. Its been years of this.

4) I'm going broke on pregnancy tests because I can't reliably say ""ope, my periods late"". Considering my last period was in December 2020, and before that December 2018. Soooo.

I have a wonderful partner, but he has some misconceptions about bisexuality that I don't feel equipped to help fix. I just found out I think women are beautiful last week, and since then my boyfriend has been telling me he feels like something is ""off"" and he kept asking me if anything is different with me.

I'm editing this part to add that my emotions were heightened when I thought he was looking at my post history. The more time passes, the more inclined I am to believe he hasn't lied to me.

 I think he might have looked through my reddit account, but he'll never admit to that, even though I asked him. That's really the biggest issue to me because I feel like my trust is violated, and there is a chance I might be being gaslit. However, he could also really be telling the truth and maybe I was acting strangely, though he won't tell me how I was acting strangely. The other day he saw me reading a post from bi_irl, and wouldn't drop it until I told him why I was subscribed. 


He took it well at first and I assured him nothing will change with us, and that I loved him, but after that he started crying at night because he feels like we'll drift apart. Later he was more specific, and he said he was afraid I would start wanting to experiment with women, something I don't feel any desire to do because I'm in a committed relationship with someone I love. 


He's honestly genuinely been so good to me, and this is the first time he's done anything to really hurt my feelings. It caught me off-guard, and I don't know who else to turn to because I'm not quite ready to come out to anyone else who I know. He feels a lot of remorse for the thoughts he's having, but he says he can't stop, and I'm still feeling hurt, so I'm not sure how to salvage this situation. I genuinely don't think this will be the end of this relationship, but I need him to get his shit together.

kgjycx,WomensHealth,1608424664.0,"My (19F) pediatrician/family physician that I liked a lot and that I could actually talk to about health concerns comfortably recently stopped working at the clinic I go to and I'm having a really hard time finding someone who was as good as her. Every doctor I've seen since treats me like I'm just taking up their time and that none of my concerns are valid or worth looking into. It's like I'm just a work task they want to get done with as quick as possible so they can check me off their to-do list for the day. I'm thinking about searching for a new clinic to go to. 

**Long rant paragraph:**

A couple weeks ago I went to a general practitioner in my system to get a prescription for something I recently got diagnosed with (which my lovely old pediatrician recommended I get tested for in the first place) and first he tried to give me medication that treats something I don't even have and when I pointed that out he then prescribed me something else in capsule-form (which you can't really break into smaller doses) that were FOUR TIMES the standard starting-out dose after I told him I'd like to take the smallest amount possible to test how it works for me and work my way up. Even my pharmacist was like ""whoa now I've never seen a doctor prescribe this much for a first-timer."" I actually had to argue with this doctor to give me a new prescription because I felt unsafe with the one he gave me, and all he said was ""well fine but all of my long-time patients do just fine with the first prescription I gave you"" yeah probably because they've tried the lower dose and worked their way up to what you prescribe them now. Guess what? The new lower dose I got works perfectly and the first one he gave me made me feel like I was going to die a couple hours after taking it and I ended up having to stay in bed the rest of the day. I honestly think that had some long term effects on me as my new normal is not what it used to be before taking that first dose. Reminder that this is the only doctor at my clinic who works with prescribing medication for what I have, he's like their specialist. I can't believe it. 

**Question:**

How do you go about finding a clinic and doctor that you think you will like? I've been blessed with good insurance that is very widely accepted in my area so I'm not worried that part of it, but I have absolutely no idea what to look for when searching for a new place to get yearly exams/prescription refills at.

This probably all sounds really dumb, forgive me I'm just so unfamiliar with this kind of stuff. 

1. When I rub my clitoris, it doesn't feel good. It just kinda burns...? Not painfully, but the feeling is there. I try to go from different angles and stuff but it doesn't seem to work. I end up roughly rubbing it with the tips of my fingers, and that feels pretty good but is only really pleasurable when I'm so rough that I'm afraid I might hurt myself.(I've also tried rubbing the outside of my vagina but that just felt weird and uncomfy) I guess maybe I'm just not as sensitive as I hoped? 

2.how? Maybe it's just the method I'm using that's not doing it for me, but I don't know any other ways to pleasure myself. I have tried to do some research on masturbation but I'm either not comfortable with it or it doesn't work out.

3. I'm to afraid of inserting my fingers because I'm afraid I'll hurt myself or get it dirty. I also paint my nails a lot so I'm afraid of getting nail polish in there if that makes sense? I debated using the end of one of my old toothbrushes or something but I don't know if that's a good idea.

I've been with my bf for almost a year and a half, and he is a lovely, wonderful man. I've not made the best choices about guys I've dated in the past, and it's left me with a pretty massive inferiority complex that I've spent a lot of time working on with my therapist.

Our anniversary was in August, and so of course I started planning my gift to him several months prior so I could make sure I really put a lot of time and thought into it. He had the idea to go on a romantic weekend away as a celebration, which I adored. and I happily helped him plan it. I ended up doing pretty much all the research and planning on cottages, rental cars, itinerary etc. He generously paid for the trip despite me offering to contribute a portion, because he makes significantly more than I do.

A few weeks before we left, he asked me what I wanted for an anniversary gift and I told him I'd love a bracelet or necklace, nothing extravagant, just something simple that I could wear daily to remind me of him. He agreed and said we could shop for something together on our trip, which I thought was a really nice idea. That didn't end up working out, nothing we saw really jumped out at either of us so we agreed we'd keep looking when we got back. He asked me for suggestions of pieces I'd seen online so he could get a better sense of my jewelry preferences, but was really cagey and evasive when I asked him for a price range. The only reason I asked was because I wanted to make sure I didn't come off as like, presumptuous or gold digger-y by showing him stuff that was too expensive.

Since getting back, we've gone shopping in person once or twice at various local boutiques, and haven't really seen anything either, aside from one bracelet that I was really drawn to but was unfortunately sold by the time he tried to buy it. I've sent him probably a dozen different pieces I like, ranging in price from $40-$120, the upper end of that range is what I spent on his gift. 

At this point it's December and he still hasn't found anything or mentioned it. I'm almost afraid to bring it up, I really *really* don't want to come off like a nag or like I'm entitled to his money or anything. I really, truly do not give a damn about the price or whatever of the piece, I just care about the thought and intent behind it, and what his continued inaction says about his feelings towards me.

I am a young adult. I have not shit myself since I wore diapers-- I've never had an emergency moment like the ones you read about, I do not have any medical concerns. But I do get very anxious and my diet is rather fucked up from the US election. As a result my stomach has been weird. I had my period about a week ago and (like always) it goes constipation leading up, then diarrhea. But that was a week ago. So to me, this is v unusual. 

Today, I was sitting on my bed with a few spare minutes to go on instagram before getting ready for work. I am sitting there, and I think, ""huh. My stomach feels a little weird. I'll fart,"" and immediately I knew. OH NO. I ran to the bathroom and see that I literally shit myself. It was rather anticlimactic-- I took a shower, threw out my underwear ( i could have washed it but I was mortified) and threw the rest of my clothes in the laundry. I tried to go to the bathroom again, but there was nothing. Then I took two tums and went to work. I feel fine now.

So... what was that all about??? Did my body just malfunction for a moment? I'm scared that this alludes to something weird... And it also was a punch in the gut to my confidence.

183tbgo,WomensHealth,1700945805.0,"I'm writing this with the hope that this may help someone out or potentially save their life. It's a long journey but I'll try to be as brief as possible without missing out the important details.

I started my period at 9 years old. I would get it quite often but aside that, it was pretty normal and I never experienced cramps or PMS symptoms. That changed when I 14 and a half though. For the first time in my life I had a stomach ache while menstruating. It felt so weird. My aunt gave me an Ibuprofen, it didn't really help but the pain was honestly manageable. Things only got worse from then on. 

The pain got worse with time and when I was 17 it got to the point where I would pass out due to the pain, I wouldn't be able to breathe properly. The first 3-4 days of my period I'd be unable to do anything. No pain killers helped, no hot milk or hot water bottles helped. Nothing help, the pain would only go when it wanted to. I felt helpless. The worst part was the dismissals around me. Everyone around me would tell me how it's normal and periods are supposed to hurt and how it's natural. I would always argue back that it was unbearable. There had to be something wrong with me. But no one listened.

Admist all the gaslighting, I began to slowly accept it that my struggles were normal. I stopped telling people that no my pain was actually much worse than what they described cause pain killers helped them feel better. There was no use, no one listened. 

It wasn't until when I was 20 and met the love of my life, my husband that someone finally said to me, ""You know I don't think the pain and the symptoms you have when you get your period."" That sentence felt like my first gulp of cold water after years of being stranded in a desert. My husband's a med student and he suggested I should go to a gynecologist.

I was hesitant to the idea. I didn't want to go to one because I was scared I'd be told this was normal and there was nothing wrong with me like I had been told all my life. I didn't want to be an over reacter. I wanted validation cause I knew there was something wrong but I was scared that I would never get it hence I didn't want to go to a specialist for it. But my husband was persistent. A few months after our wedding, he told me to a gynecologist. 

I described my pain, the gynecologist suspected it was endometriosis. I was given a butt load of tests to get done. We got them done. Part of me didn't want it to be endo, another parted wanted it to be endo so I'd finally have a diagnosis. All of my tests came back clear. There was nothing. Nothing on the results but my pain was very much there. The gynecologist said everything was normal but gave me birth control for my cramps and my cycle being short. I didn't take it though. A lot of old wives tales and a tonne of bad reviews on the Internet had me scared. My husband explained to me that it was fine, I could take it and I could just stop if the side effects were bad. I agreed to take them once my next cycle started.

But things were supposed to unfold differently, I was never able to take the pills. One night in September I had deep pain in the right side of my lower back. I couldn't stand it. My husband along with my parents rushed me to the ER. I had very weird symptoms. The pain from the right side of my lower back was radiating into my right buttock. On the way, the right side of my neck began to hurt, and so did the behind and inside of my right ear. I felt numb knee down in my right leg and there was a weird tingling sensation. I seldom cry over physical pain but this had me crying and screaming. 

I was given pain killers in the ER and I had tests done, CBC, Ultrasound and eventually CT scan. All of my tests were normal, eventually my doctor decided a diagnostic laproscopy needed to be done. When I gained consciousness, I found out that my appendix had been removed. It was a retrocecal appendix and was hidden behind my kidney, hence it didn't show up on any of my scans. No traces of endometriosis were found despite the previous suspicions. 

After surgery when I got my period, I had no cramps, no PMS nothing. It was like I was 14 again! I asked my husband and he told me that I also had a cyst on my right ovary that was too small to be caught on any scans, that was drained too during surgery. So no endo but there had been a cyst.

I haven't had any of the severe period pains I used to have before this surgery. It honestly changed and saved my life for good. If you have severe cramps and are unable to do anything during your periods, that is not normal at all. We need to stop being dismissive of periods cramps and bad periods. Periods shouldn't hurt this much. They shouldn't be an obstacle, it's a natural process and unless there's something severely wrong, it shouldn't be so disordered and painful. Please don't dismiss your daughters, sisters, friends or partners or even yourself. It is okay to search for solutions and diagnosis even if it takes years and a tonne of your money. Everyone deserves comfort and cure. I hope this helps someone out and if someone from the medical community is reading this, please consider this and talk about this within your community, it could really help someone out.

16tfiwn,WomensHealth,1695805391.0,"For the most part I have had good sex health. This for years has come as a surprise to me and maybe a few friends who know me to be very promiscuous. I had an HPV scare in my early years, but after a cervical exam it turned out to be a bad PAP. 

I‚Äôm 33 years old and I am already in menopause. I have had two surgeries to removed endometriosis in a years time, with my last surgery leading to a hysterectomy! If I am being honest‚Ä¶. I AM PISSED! 

Nearly two years ago (31) I went to my GYN to discuss my cycle. My period was putting me down like never before. The symptoms leading up to my monthly cycle were very problematic. The cycle it self was heavy, but always on time. The biggest issue was shedding my entire lining in one day. It was something out of a horror scene, It didn‚Äôt even look real! I went to my female GYN. I listed off my issues. 

-weight gain
-heavy cycle
-pre menstrual symptoms are bad
-painful bowel movements 

She completed a vaginal exam, a Pap, and blood panel. Two weeks later she referred me to my general practitioner for weight-loss! I went back two months later. Again something wrong! She asked how I feel about birth control. I took the birth control to try and stop my periods. The BC was unsuccessful. I went back to her‚Ä¶‚Äùsomething is wrong!‚Äù Instead I left with new script of BC. I started regularly seeing a chiropractor to treat my lower right back sciatic pain. 

I promise if you google all my symptoms, even it could tell you ‚Äúendometriosis.‚Äù The back pain one day was so severe, my husband insisted I had kidney stones. Would you like to guess what I had‚Ä¶? 1 very large grapefruit size cyst! Pathology would later reveal previously ruptured cyst tissue was found. The surgeon went in that day and said it was the second worse case of endometriosis he had ever seen! This surgeon worked at the same practice as my GYN. I am 6 month post op from my hysterectomy, because my case was so bad! I had regrowth in just a few months.

I think back to Dr. Catherine often! To this day I am terrified my health concerns will not be taken serious.

She went to her doctor and told him about intermittent periods where her chest felt funny and it got better with rest. He diagnosed her with anxiety and gave her medication for it. When that didn‚Äôt help, he told her it must be gas pains (reflux) and gave her meds for that. I happened to be visiting her and saw one of these ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù. I told her it was classic cardiac ischemia and made her call a cardiologist for an appointment. She got in the next week. Ironically all of her labs, EKG, and stress test were normal. He still thought the same as me and sent her for a heart cath. She had two arteries with 95% blockage and got two stents. I asked her to switch primary care doctors after that.

Fast forward to last week. My mother was having chest pressure again. Her new doctor also said gas pains and reassured her it was not her heart.

So I went to my university nurse yesterday after suspecting for some time now that I have PCOS or at the very least a hormone imbalance. My symptoms include sudden excess hair growth on my face, acne, mood swings, depressive episodes when I'm pre-menstrual, etc. I also have a family history of PCOS. I had originally booked the appointment to get a hormone blood test, but she didn't carry that out. Instead I felt so gaslit and patronised by her like I was making it up. The first thing she did was weigh me, which was extremely triggering for me as I have a history of eating disorders. I'm fully recovered now and live an extremely healthy lifestyle. I lift weights, I run and do pilates and I eat really good wholesome food. My natural build is of someone who is thick and musclular and that's the way i have always been. Even when I had an eating disorder and was starving myself, my bmi was 21 at its lowest. She then informed me that my BMI was 26 and that getting my weight down would control the hormones. I'm not gonna lie, I was crushed. It was so triggering for me as someone who still suffers with sever body image issues. She did not once ask me about my lifestyle and just simply made an assumption about me based on my BMI. It was crushing and I honestly didn't really hear what she had to say for the rest of the appointment. I went home immediately after the appointment and sobbed my eyes out for a couple hours.

xx9tv9,WomensHealth,1665074471.0,"2 days ago my GP told me I have chlamydia. This was a huge shock because I have been with my boyfriend for over 4 years. I have definitely not been unfaithful and he hasn‚Äôt been either.

The reason I went to the GP was for stress - I only mentioned in passing I had spotting one day. Not so uncommon for me as I‚Äôm on the combined pill, I like to skip my period as much as possible. Chlamydia was unthinkable. 

Before my partner and I got together 4 years ago, we each hadn‚Äôt had sex with other people for years even prior to that. I‚Äôve only had sex with him (no condoms) and my high school boyfriend (strictly condoms as I wasn‚Äôt on the pill). These are the only 2 people I have EVER been with. I‚Äôm very much demisexual and have never had casual sexual activity.

I do not believe my bf cheated on me, I‚Äôm just truly confused. He‚Äôs had 1x casual hookup with protection but apart from that also only with 2 serious gfs, the last relationship ended maybe 3 years before we got together.

My q‚Äôs -
- I know chlamydia can be dormant and we‚Äôve both had no symptoms, but can it really be THAT many years?
- I get UTIs a lot so I‚Äôve been on antibiotics countless times, including just about 5 weeks before getting diagnosed with chlamydia, wouldn‚Äôt that have cleared somewhere along the way? 
-Has anyone here had a false positive?

on monday i went to the ER after experiencing intense abdominal cramps and some bleeding while i‚Äôm not on my period.

it was recommended that i get a pelvic exam done so they can do some swabbing as i also showed signs for a yeast infection paired with a UTI. i already have medical trauma from previous OBGYN visits so i was vocal about my need for a warning before doing anything, and the medical student agreed and let the doctor overseeing the exam know as well.

i did not expect the medical student to fail to properly insert the speculum, and she began opening the speculum before it was inserted into my vagina, instead pinching my already inflamed labia and putting pressure on my urethra instead. words cannot explain how much pain i was in, i was sobbing and trying not to scream. 

second time she tried to insert the speculum it fell out and she didn‚Äôt get it right until the third try, which thankfully was correct and didn‚Äôt cause any pain. 

i do not know what to do about this, i ended up leaving the ER feeling worse than i did when i entered and i now have even more medical trauma, which sucks because i have more pelvic exams and ultrasounds in my future as i was found to have a complex ovarian cyst larger than a golf ball on my left ovary.

And I have a huge secret I‚Äôve kept for a few years. When I was in middle school they didn‚Äôt teach us sex education cuz I was in a private catholic school. I ended up getting interested in porn and masturbation. I started off watching porn first in the videos women love big dicks and having in really deep- this is important. I finally decided I wanted to try masturbation. The videos I watched were very hardcore on pornhub. Because they were my first videos I watched I thought I was pretty educated. I started with fingers but after that I wanted to try something penis like because the fingers weren‚Äôt working for me. I used a big tube one of those ones little kids use to blow bubbles. I went in with the mindset bigger the better and deeper is better too. I stuffed the entire tube( it was really long more than 6 inches or something like that) I tried to get off but couldn‚Äôt. It hurt and didn‚Äôt feel good. I thought I was the problem because all the others girls in the porn videos said it was good.

rftg8k,TwoXSupport,1639438376.0,"I just. Urgh. Why are men like this. Recently I've been dealing with this man. He is borderline old enough to be my father, is part of a club I'm in (and otherwise really enjoy), is in a position of authority in said club, aaaand recently he keeps subtly/NOT so subtly hitting on me. 


The first time he started making comments it really threw me, as until then I thought he was a quite a sweet guy. He knows I have a partner, so he doesn't do/say anything super over the top, but it's just unceasing small comments, which clearly demonstrate he thinks we would start going out if I were single. I have straight to his face told him I wouldn't date him even if I was, and yet he takes me saying this as a joke. Also, as I said he's a bit older than me, so in the beginning I viewed it as him being kind of awkwardly paternal when he would call me a 'sweet'/'adorable' girl (and even, with an affectionate tone after I made the most minor of mistakes/raised an issue, he's called me 'a little nightmare' and 'a little trouble maker'). Now that I know he thinks I'm 'hot' though, and he keeps saying stuff like this, it just...makes me want to throw up a little tbh.


Overall, I can deal with this though. I'm planning to talk to someone higher up in the club and go from there. But, all of this has left me feeling a little sensitive. While I logically _know_ that I'm not the one who is being gross and acting inappropriately here, the little voice in the back of my head keeps going over how I could have given him the impression I was interested. I'm also finding myself shying away from any strong outward displays of femininity (I'm not the most femme person to start with). 


So, that brings us to today. The straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, is actually nothing to do with aforementioned gross man, but actually to do with my boyfriend. I'm going to be going to a very large family party of his soon, and I was thinking of buying a new dress for the occasion. On a break from work today, I was texting about this with him, and he sent me a couple pictures of a style of dress, as a suggestion. It's the type that is fairly high necked, but has a big slit right down the chest, so you can see cleavage. Now, I'm fine with V necked cleavage, but for some reason I've just really never liked the slit down the middle cleavage reveal for myself. Something about feeling too exposed I guess? Having said that, if we were talking about a dress to wear for going out, or to a party with friends, I'd maybe entertain getting one to try out anyway. 


However, this is for a FAMILY event, and IMO is waaay too revealing! I've worn more revealing things in the past, and sometimes it can feel super empowering rather than at all demeaning, but this just would not sit right with me for this type of event. Also, though the family have never shown me anything but truly lovely kindness, I would feel so uncomfortable being so...on display? Like, the thought has occurred to me multiple times that if I misjudged gross club man so much, maybe I've misjudged bf's grandpa, uncles and cousins...I don't want to be ogled, and especially not by the in laws.


Unfortunately my work break when we were talking about this ended, and I got home quite late, so bf and I haven't had a chance to talk about this properly yet. But I'm just drained you guys. I realise when it comes to the dress and my bf, I'm blowing it out of proportion, but, combined with how I've been feeling due to the creeper, I just don't have the mental space to deal well with it right now :(

lybwbx,WomensHealth,1614951184.0,"I'm only 26 and this has been a recurring problem for 4 years. It started when I was using disposable pads daily for incontinence. I have a condition (EDS) which does make my skin more fragile. The tear is always in the same place, and it does heal but slowly. Sometimes it's gone for months, sometimes just days. The tear is at the very entrance to my vagina, just south of it, and can be seen from the outside. Sometimes its caused by sex, but usually its seemingly random. I think the skin there become inflamed/aggravated and this causes a tear to happen. 

2-3 years ago I went to a very helpful gyno who recommended avoiding pads, and using a moisturisturiser like epaderm instead of soap. This helped a lot, and I managed to stop needing pads as I was doing pelvic floor therapy with another doctor. The gyno also told me that there is some scarring in that area. 

During this time I had become afraid of sex. I have PTSD from a rape that happened as a teenager. I've been with the same partner for 6 years and the first 2 our sex life was amazing and I felt very safe. At some point when the tear appeared, the pain during sex was triggering my PTSD, although I didnt realise it at the time. The other pain was caused by my pelvic floor, which tensed all the time and caused muscle spasms, which is what caused my incontinence. 

2 years ago I went though over a year of therapy for my PTSD, and between that and the pelvic floor therapy I no longer get pain from my pelvic floor. 

Once that pain was gone, the pain from the tear became more obvious. Although I can enjoy sex again, I'm concerned about even more scar tissue happening. My boyfriend is also, understandably, put off as he doesnt want to hurt me. 

I had avoided the doctors for it at this time as I didnt want them to assume I was having overly rough sex or something. A month ago I tried using a menstrual cup and on removing it, it caused a worse tear then normal. I felt like this is enough evidence to go to the doctors and say ""this is not normal"". 

So I did, but she seemed a bit at a loss for what can be done. I'm getting referred back to gyno, but I'd really like to learn as much as I can beforehand so that I have ideas when they ask me. Usually my doctors always ask what it is I want to try etc, they expect me to have ideas for treatments.

My gyno will only place an iud if you are on your period.

This is my first IUD insertion. I am 24 with no children. My IUD was ordered in October and I was told I had to wait until I was on my period for it to be inserted after it arrived. In November my period came while my gynos office was closed on thanksgiving. I called them the week after and asked if I could schedule the insertion for next month 1-2 days before my period because I expected my period to come on Christmas and probably be mostly gone by the time they reopened and they told me no. They will not place an iud if I am not on my period and that I also have to take misoprostal the night before the insertion.

I scheduled my appointment for the 29th because that‚Äôs the soonest they could get me in and I was hoping me period may come a little later or last longer.

Of course I got my period  the day before Christmas. The first two days were the heaviest. Now I am just occasionally having some discharge and my period is coming to an end. Idk if I will even still be bleeding by tomorrow.  

It has taken me 2 months to get this stupid IUD scheduled and my gyno is an hour away from me, so it is a pain in the ass to see her and take time off of work (I took the entire day off, because my appointment is in the middle of the day and I didn‚Äôt feel like trying to rush back to work and I thought I may want to take it easy after the insertion) 
The reason I‚Äôm going to her is because the other gynos in my area (a small rural town) will not place iuds in people who have not had children (I tried two others before her) The closest planned parenthood to me is an hour and a half away, an since my iud had to be shipped to the doctor placing it, I can‚Äôt  just change doctors to planned parenthood now. 

I was wondering if I should just keep my appointment for Tuesday even if I am not actively bleeding and say I am still on my period, just not bleeding heavily if they question it. I have misoprostal, which I am assuming does something to dilate/soften your cervix anyway. I have a high pain tolerance and I just want to get this over with and not have to push it off for another month. I guess I could take aspirin before going in to help with any other pain.

It didn't help one bit, but I continued taking it because it regulated my otherwise very irregular periods and eliminated 100% of my agonizing period pain. The numerous awful side effects of hormonal birth control are never discussed in a general physician's office, and it wasn't until this year when I met with a specialist that I discovered I have a diagnosis called *hormonally* *mediated vestibulodynia,* caused from combination hormonal birth control. I have been suffering from painful intercourse for years and it's caused a huge wedge in my marriage. I have no sex drive and can't even think of an instance where I actually *wanted* to have sex for the past few years. I feel inferior to other women with (normal) sex drives who are actually able to enjoy sex with their husbands. In arguments, my husband has described me as having a ""BROKEN PUSSY"" time after time again, which is so hateful and demoralizing.

I am planning to come off hormonal birth control once and for all towards the end of the year, but have to come up with a plan for my skin first. I am in fear that my cystic acne on my face, chest, and back that I used to have as a teen will come back. It was so awful and painful, and sometimes I would rather just stay on birth control and deal with my painful sexual issues than deal with the embarrassment of cystic acne covering every inch of my face.

I know that I am an attractive woman and I know that I have decently sized breasts and a bottom and I don‚Äôt know why I feel so disgusted with myself.

In April, a nurse practitioner confirmed it didn't look like HPV or herpes and just looked like shaving bumbs. I use those Schick Intuiton razors. I've used the flawless body electric razor in the past, but it never gets all the hair & leaves little bumbs (not as bad as the ones I've recently had, though, so maybe I should just go back to that?). Would a razor specifically designed for shaving pubes be better? 

I tried Nair hair remover that is specifically for pubic hair. However, it never completly gets all of the hair. Also, it's hard to not accidentally get some on my labia and it always stings or feels weird down there after I use it. I'm worried it could lead to infection or other issues. 

I'm opposed to waxing, simply because I get my brows waxed and that's unbearable enough. I imagine waxing my vulva would be even more painful. Also, it seems like something that could very easily cause irritation and infection. 

I don't want to get laser hair removal, because I've heard that it can cause hair to grow thicker/darker in other places. Plus, I'm assuming its expensive.

So last week I made a post asking if it was weird or rash to insist on an IUD and got a lot of support and advice from you guys as well as a good knock to my anxiety riddled head about how it isn‚Äôt weird to ask for birth control from someone who can provide it. Idk if this is allowed to update on but I felt the need to (Mods you can remove this if you want to if it‚Äôs going against anything)

So I got to the appointment and the nurse was doing all the usual stuff (BP, temp, etc) and when he asked about my need for an IUD, I was kinda proud of myself that I wasn‚Äôt too awkward about it and he was super supportive too. He did ask why not pills, I said I‚Äôm really bad at taking them over a long period of time (hell I‚Äôm shit at taking a multivitamin everyday so I can imagine I‚Äôll miss more than one day) and he was like ‚ÄúYeah totally get it. You seem like you have a base knowledge of everything and you know what you want. Good for you!‚Äù I think he definitely made me more comfortable about the entire thing which is a nice change. Probably could tell that I was a little nervous but hey who knows.

My PCP came in after and talked through all the options, asked if I wanted to get hormonal or copper, and then sent in a referral to a OB/GYN for me to get Mirena. Ultimately, we settled on that because it lasts 5 years (compared to Kyleena‚Äôs 3) and hopefully it‚Äôll help manage my long and heavy period

I only have one partner. My boyfriend. I‚Äôve only had sex with two people, the first took my v card but now just my boyfriend. 

Everytime I have sex it‚Äôs just not enjoyable. It feels like it‚Äôs burning every time.

1cwama4,WomensHealth,1716193961.0,"I‚Äôm at my wits end with trying to get a diagnosis for the ongoing pelvic pain I have. I thought everything would change when I found this 5 star rated nurse practitioner on ZocDoc, everyone raved about her in the reviews saying that she advocates for women, that she take women seriously about their issues, and that she does everything she possibly can to get a diagnosis. So, I was so damn excited to maybe figure wtf is wrong with my body. 

I gave her my period history. Heavy bleeding (bleed through a super tampon in 2hrs), extreme cramps with a family history of periods like this. How every woman in my family had a hysterectomy by the age of 30. I was asked about the rest of my cycle, pelvic cramps/stomach pain all throughout. I told her that despite being on the depo shot (& having no period) I still have the occasional painful cramps. I told her about my sexlife, and how my body can‚Äôt do certain positions like the legs over the shoulder without pain, how missionary sometimes causes pain, how deep penetration is a no-no for me. How I can‚Äôt even masturbate and enjoy an orgasm without my pelvic area screaming bloody murder. How I have painful urination randomly but no uti, or how I‚Äôm in a chronic state of constipation or diarrhea and that I‚Äôm always bloated. 

I told her my fears that it is endometriosis. But she said she wanted to rule everything out first. So I got test upon test, scan after scan and nothing, nothing showed up. Nothing explained this pain. It was at this point that she agreed with me that she thinks it‚Äôs endo. So I ask her if I can get a laparoscopy to get the confirmation, and I was denied. Why? Because she said she wasn‚Äôt sure about it and that I‚Äôm too young (24F), and what if it‚Äôs not endo and I‚Äôm stuck with scars. I said I didn‚Äôt care and that scars is nothing compared to pain. She still said no, and suggested I go to a pelvic floor therapist instead. I told her that while yes that might help the pain I still need an answer. I still need to know what exactly this all is. 

This all just feels like one big joke. I feel let down by healthcare. It is because I‚Äôm young that I want to do the laparoscopy. I need to know the cause so I can stop feeling crazy about what I‚Äôm feeling. So I can stop getting gaslit by doctors saying ‚Äúpain is normal‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not that bad.‚Äù And if it‚Äôs not endometriosis, that‚Äôs okay because I will have ruled out another possible diagnosis and I can continue forward on this journey until I have an answer.

Hello,
I know this is ignorant to ask out is it possible to get a false result for chlamydia?
I‚Äôve been with my current partner for over 2 years. He says his previous unprotected sexual encounter was about a year and a half before me. He said he had been tested a bit before us meeting and that he was clean. I was tested/pap two months before we met and was clean as well. This past December I was pregnant and had a pap/test for chlamydia and gonorrhea. I ended up having a miscarriage and was told I have a high risk strain of HPV but tested negative for everything else. I was really upset since I‚Äôve never had HPV or any std before. I got my colpo and results that I had a very minor lesion that will clear up with no issue. He decided to go to the doctor for a check up and to ask for a full std screening since we worked it out. They called him this morning telling him he tested positive for chlamydia and herpes. I was enraged. I yelled at him, accused him of cheating, I feel disgusted that I‚Äôve been exposed to all this crap. He remains adamant that he‚Äôs been faithful and I don‚Äôt know what to think‚Ä¶

I‚Äôm so confused. This is so weird and sad. I suddenly have ZERO sex drive. Like I‚Äôm not even saying low libido I‚Äôm saying completely non existent.

And like, I looked through the other people who‚Äôve asked similar questions here and on the internet and I don‚Äôt have ANY of the possible reasons: I‚Äôm not on birth control, antidepressants, I don‚Äôt have a hormonal imbalance, health problems, anxiety or stress, etc)

So what could it be? This is so depressing I‚Äôm actually heartbroken and I don‚Äôt feel like myself anymore let alone like a normal 20 yr old girl. I usually have a consistently high sex drive, what the hell changed?? 

Also, if none of these are my reasons, what can I do to get it back? Everything else about me is still normal and I still feel attracted to men in every way except sexually.

ll0ek8,WomensHealth,1613468054.0,"My Fibroid Journey: 1 week post-op

I am 1 week post-op from have my 12cm fibroid removed from my body. We spent 10+ long years together. While I am sore, and tired, and still healing, I am thankful.

In 2011 I first heard the word fibroid. In a post-op appointment from an exploratory laparoscopy (for indeterminate abdomen pain) I was told there was a 5mm fibroid on my left ligament, but don‚Äôt worry about it, they are normal. And I didn‚Äôt think about it at all. 

Flash forward to 2016/17 and in a doctors appointment for CT results (for indeterminate stomach pain) I was told I have a 5cm fibroid in my left ligament and top of my uterine wall. I would be referred to a OBGYN. This specialist wouldn‚Äôt even look at me. He stared at the ceiling while he told me about treatment options and palpated my stomach. He had horrible bedside manners to say the least. After he ordered an MRI, he said ‚Äúloose weight, fall in love, have a baby, and then we will take it out‚Äù. He made it sound so simple, as if. Instead I decided to get a second opinion.

So off I went to another OBGYN in 2018. He ordered an ultrasound. After looking at the scans he said it‚Äôs grown to 7cm, and says ‚Äúit‚Äôs in a dangerous spot, good chance if I opened you up you will bleed out and loose your uterus or your life‚Äù and ‚Äúbut if you leave it in it would not harm you getting pregnant‚Äù but ‚Äúif it‚Äôs cancer it would be bad, I‚Äôve only saved 1 women in my career from that kind of cancer‚Äù followed by ‚Äúso let‚Äôs follow up in a year‚Äù. What I really took from that conversation was ‚Äòdon‚Äôt mess with it‚Äô. And a year later I called to follow up but he retired and did not pass along his patients. 

Shortly after that year mark I moved to a new city and then the pandemic hit. 

In May of 2020 I went to my new family physician with indeterminate stomach pain and she was concerned it was appendicitis so she sent me to the ER for a CT. The emergency doctor came to me and said, ‚Äúnot sure what the stomach pain is but you have a fibroid did you know that?‚Äù I said ‚Äúyes, I‚Äôve known for awhile, but how big is it?‚Äù And he says 10cm. The next day my family physician calls to check in and I mention that my fibroid has grown a bit since it was last monitored. Somehow 2 weeks later she had me in to see a new OBGYN. I was shocked at how quick and extremely happy to find out she was a women. Within moments of sitting in her room she says, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time to take this tumor out, and it needs to be sooner rather than later‚Äù plus ‚Äúwe are going to save that uterus because we still have business with it‚Äù. I was shocked how sure she was and scared by everything I had been told before, but I just trusted her immediately. 

February 2021, 8 months after that first visit, she successfully saved my uterus. It wasn‚Äôt an easy surgery but she did what she said she was going to do and I could not be more grateful. 

She is very specialized in laparoscopic so her plan was to hopefully complete it that way but we had discussed that if anything looked concerning she would switch to open, and that is what ended up happening, but I‚Äôm pretty happy with the outcome.

My story is my story, and I share because I hope another person can read this and fight to find that surgeon who will look them in the eye and treat them with compassion. I know I got lucky (incredibly lucky) but there are good physicians, surgeons, OBGYNs out there, and I hope you all find one.

Ps. My amazing OBGYN doesn‚Äôt think my fibroid was what was causing me my indeterminate abdomen pain - so that search is still on (for another day).",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/ll0ek8/the_power_of_a_confident_doctor_a_fibroid_story/,The power of a confident doctor - a fibroid story,,59,18,0.97,Oveyeh91
l65qnw,TwoXSupport,1611758158.0,"Hopefully this will become a discussion thread but I want to share my personal experience with exercise first:

I have had body image issues pretty much since I went through puberty and have often used exercise to feel better about myself and feel more at home in my body. My love of exercise led me to become an athletics coach! Unfortunately making something you consider a coping mechanism into your livelihood things tend to stress you out. I also was consistently frustrated by the ableism in exercise culture.

In addition, I have struggled with anorexia recently and overall my relationship to my body and how it moves has always been complicated. In lockdown I moved in with my boyfriend who was very afraid of the illness and kept us cooped up, which I was ok with because I already worked in a high risk environment.

I have ""worked out"" less this year than I have in a decade, which was an unfortunate throwback to my sad preteen years. However, I started doing different types of body movement like dance, more yoga and more gentle forms of exercise like walking (not that I didn't view these as exercise before, but more that I didn't view them as ""the goal"" of exercise). In some disciplines this is called ""internal work"": a type of movement that does not meet any external goals like physical prowess or fitness. This coincided with me diving deeper into meditation, and through meditation I have been able to deconstruct the goal-oriented nature of most fitness/exercise programs.

Because of my anxiety, removing the ""goals of exercise"" has helped me feel more calm overall and even though I'm working out less, I am happy during every exercise session instead of needlessly pushing myself towards a goal. Having this year to reflect and dissect my exercise habits has helped me create a model of living that makes me much happier and less stressed. As more people get the vaccine, I feel I'll be able to start old activities like hitting the gym with a more positive, meditative mindset instead of a goal oriented one.

I hope to hear what others have learned about their bodies in regards to exercise during this pandemic",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/l65qnw/the_lockdown_has_changed_how_i_view_working_out/,The Lockdown has changed how I view working out in a healthy way,Discussion,56,15,0.98,Schizowreckage
kl13x3,TwoXSupport,1609062635.0,"I was sexually abused by two men 10+ my senior between the ages of 16-22. I was vulnerable (covert incest from my mother, mostly absent father, bullied loner) and confused the attention with love. 

When confronted with evidence of my abuse (picture found on my old cell phone) my mother shamed me, telling me my father was disgusted and mortified to find them. 

She didn't ask if I was okay or inquire about why her 17 year old daughter had lewd photos. She knew I was spending a lot of time (every weekend friday night to Sunday evening) with a 27 year old man. She even dropped me off at his apartment once and told me, as I was leaving the car, ""Have lots of orgasms! I have one everyday!""

ntsoqh,TwoXSupport,1623005558.0,"[Trigger warning: experiences with abuse, DV, sexual assault] 

Hello whomever, I was really glad to find this subreddit very recently. I've had a difficult year, coming out of an abusive relationship, and I'm within the police investigation process of having my ex tried for multiple counts of sexual assault against me. 

It's been a challenging time to say the least, and I have a great support network, and honestly have been killing it personally while  maintaining professional stuff and trying to actively heal from the trauma of the past ~2 years. 

I've been trying to reach out and meet new people lately- more specifically, make new friends, because I don't have any in-person friends in this city. I am trying to hold off on dating for a while yet, as I still have a lot of healing to do, and am far from being ready to enter the dating scene, or a relationship (emotional or physical). 

I reconnected with this acquaintance recently, I reached out to see if he still lived in town. We've hung out only twice now, but I have anxiety that he might be interested in me romantically. After our first hang out he sent a text later that day saying how great it was, and that we seem to get along well, yadda yadda. Cue me having a full breakdown, anxiety attack thinking that he's trying to push a romantic connection. I waited until the next day to respond saying, ""It feels nice to have made a new friend."" Trying to push that I'm only interested in friendship, just in case. 

The last time we hung out, he was at times getting a little close too me, considering the pandemic, and I already feel kind of pressured to not wear a mask around him. At least we are both vaccinated and work from home, but still he seems to think it's unnecessary between us? Then as we were parting ways last time he asked me over for dinner and drinks sometime, and this rang out alarm bells in my head. 

It's crazy, because when I'm alone, I feel that I have done so much work to reestablish my boundaries, but now that they are being tested by a real person- I find myself clamming up! It is so frustrating and defeating! It makes me feel like crying. 

I hummed and hawed about his invitation, and when he brought it up again and mentioned it in relation to covid, only then did I feel comfortable saying that it felt a little early to be going over to someone's house for dinner. (I mean, I won't go into my family's home, so why do I feel pressured to accept his invitation??)

I am just so confused. I had told myself that when I saw him again, if I was getting weird vibes, that I would outright say, ""Hey, can we be clear that this is just a friendship connection?"" But in the moment... I felt like the same terrified girl in my last abusive relationship, unable to speak up for myself, and being pressured into situations I didn't want. 

Aaaand now I am crying. I haven't texted him since that meeting, but I have had to fight this HUGE urge to, because I feel some sort of weird need to comfort his ego because I declined his invitation. To text him anything to reassure him that he like didn't mess up or anything, to reassure him that I don't think he's weird. 

But then I'm like ""NO!"" That's not my fucking job. And if I'm being honest, while during the first meetup I felt like we got along great and connected well, the second time I noticed how (similar to the first time) it's a lot of me listening and him talking. 

I'm not really interested in a friendship or any kind of connection that doesn't feel 50/50, and like I'm mainly listening to someone else drone on and on. I felt myself wanting to rush through my sentences so that he could get back to talking, and internally I was thinking, ""I feel like the woman I was a year ago right now, trapped with a selfish man.""  :(

Well. This was long. Thank you to anyone who may actually read this. I just don't know how to proceed. I don't wanna just drop all new friends I make because I feel weird about my trauma, but maybe this isn't a healthy connection for me to keep up... I don't know.

**EDIT**: To add that I don't respond well to the ""well just move on then"" kind of response. I am hoping for empathy and compassion.

*""You're just playing the victim""*

**No.** It's OK to BE a victim. It's OK to FEEL like a victim. It's OK to feel sad that you're a victim. It's OK to recognise that being a victim impacts and restrains your life. It is OK.

Too often we hear the message that we need to ""Pull ourselves up"" and ""get on with life"", to not let ourselves be held back by being victimised. That we are 'surivivors'. That if we dwell too long in victimhood it's somehow wrong and unproductive and emotionally damaging. That maybe we're just depressed or stressed or overwhelmed or angry because we haven't moved past our victimness.

Well, I am here, now, to tell you it's OK to be a victim. You are ALLOWED to feel the way you do. Your feelings are VALID. You do not have to compare yourself to others who have 'moved on'. No one should tell you how to feel.

cgjwfe,WomensHealth,1563833732.0,"Let this be a cautionary tale to all the ladies out there who don't see the need to have checkups regularly. I am by no means telling what you should or shouldn't do, but I hope if there is something to take away from this, is to value your body and give it the respect and care it needs to keep healthy. 

All this started back in 2016 when at work, I suddenly became violently ill and had extreme lower left abdomen pain. I drove myself home and continued to roll around the floor just outside the bathroom in case I needed to throw up again. I have a history of painful periods, so I thought this was just a very bad PMS episode. After withstanding the pain for a couple of hours, I decided to go to the ER, by the time I got there the pain had subsided some, but every time I got up or walked, it got worse.

The intake nurse took my vitals and asked what my pain level was on a scale from 1-10, I said 8 and I were moved back to the waiting room, without even a painkiller. Now, I have an immense pain threshold, so I didn't look like I was struggling. After about an hour, they called me back in so I could be seen by a doctor. I explained my symptoms to her and she looked visibly concerned, she went on to check my belly, ordered an ultrasound and back to the waiting room I went. Again, no pain killers. I never saw the same doc again. 
 
I had my ultrasound done and it was so painful, I was shaking as the nurse scanned the area where it hurt and told me she couldn't see anything, she then proceeded to ask ‚Äúwhy are you overreacting like this?‚Äù. I was appalled!. After almost 9 hours in the ER and shift changes, they finally call me in, I get some Tylenol and they let me stay in a little room with other ladies awaiting their results. 3 more hours pass until finally get an answer, they dismiss it as being PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) prescribe some Metformin, which ‚Äòshould‚Äô help and some more Tylenol for the pain. I get discharged. I thought I was safe.

A week later, the same thing happens, I feel horribly sick, I'm throwing up and rolling around in pain again. I show up in the ER extremely concerned, I get dismissed as being an opioid addict and attention seeker, because ‚Äúrecords show they already checked me an found nothing, plus, you have to give the pills time to take effect‚Äù. I spend another full day in the ER at a teaching hospital, where I have student after student check me and try to figure out which diagnosis best fits me. It was frustrating, to say the least! I get sent home with stronger painkillers and a diagnosis of depression. I couldn't believe it!

A month goes by, nothing happens, I finish my treatment thinking it had worked, I was beyond happy. When again, very suddenly the same pain, in the same area with the same symptoms come back with a vengeance!. This time I at least make it to the acute wing, where the nurse in charge orders an MRI test. I finally get told, that I have PCOS but nothing can be done surgically as there is no risk of complications. Then he asks me ‚ÄúWill you leave if I write your discharge papers?‚Äù, I say no, I need to leave with an answer, this pain is killing me and I'm missing work because of it. I should have kept my mouth shut because he thought I was there just as an excuse to not go to work!. I'm dying in pain here, this is NOT made up, open me up and check me!, I was extremely frustrated, as I get sent home with a note to excuse my absence from work.

Over the next few months, I have follow up after follow up with the OBGYN and the Gastrointestinologist and nothing is figured out, again I am a guinea pig for all the students. I get sent home with no answers, because ‚Äòthe pain I'm in is not indicative of the symptoms you are showing‚Äô. My emergency medical expires and I don't qualify for the regular medical because I earn too much. I fall into a medical limbo, where I cant neither qualify for Obamacare or Medical, so I let it go. I don't get the pain again and I am grateful to be healthy for the following couple of years.

Fast forward to June 19, 2019. I have moved back home to L.A and I'm happily dropping off my sister at school when BOOM, it hits me again, very suddenly. This time I can't even walk from the pain and I'm throwing up every liter of water I have in my body, the pain is well above a 10. I try to compose myself to drive home, but I am in such pain and so weak, I have to call my parents for help. As I wait in the car, I take some Tylenol. They arrive and are immediately worried at how sick and pale I look, as we drive home, every bump in the road makes me wail in pain. Dad suggests I go to the ER, I am apprehensive because of what happened last time. Because the pain had gone away the last time, I thought I could do away with some Advil, to reduce the fever also. Maybe the doctors were right, maybe this was bad PMS again. 

I get home, drag myself up the stairs and promptly sprint to the bathroom to throw up, parents leave for work and I try to take more painkillers because the pain won't stop. I throw those up to, I am getting more dehydrated, I start feeling clammy and look paler as the time passes. Over the course of 4 hours, the pain just keeps on getting worse, at this point, I can't even keep down water. I call my cousin for help and she drives me to the ER, this time to a different hospital of her suggestion, Valley Presbyterian. During the drive, I kept running different scenarios in my head, thinking about how I was going to convince the doctors that this time, the pain is serious. I needed them to listen, I needed answers. 

We arrive in the ER at noon, thank god is relatively empty. I get checked right away by the intake nurse, everything is elevated and I am told to come inside immediately. I tell the transport nurse that it is extremely painful to walk, can I please get a wheelchair and he scoffs and says ‚ÄúThe room is right across that door‚Äù. Great, here we go again. I insist, my cousin insists and we get a wheelchair. A nurse comes in promptly to check me, I explain my symptoms, explain what happened in 2016, she proceeds to check my abdomen and I wince as soon as she touches me. She is visibly concerned as she notes that my stomach is very swollen as well. She says she will get a doctor.

The doctor comes in, asks me the same questions, checks me the same and I am given a bed as they run more tests. I am in the ER, inside and have a bed. I think, Victory! I am given IV fluids because I am extremely dehydrated and also IV painkillers, which they thought would help. They didn't, an hour passes by and my cousin is worried as I am visibly getting worse, I can't hold it anymore, I feel like someone is repeatedly stabbing and twisting my insides with a hot sword. I begin to cry. I tell my cousin to get the nurse, they ignore us for another 30 minutes, I ask for more painkillers, again ignored. An hour and a half pass, I am about to burst, my cousin tells me to just let it out, to wail and scream if I have to. 

I do, I can't hold it anymore, I am sobbing and screaming in pain. The doctor pokes her head out of her office at that same time, my parents return, she is told my family is here and promptly says ‚ÄúOh I was waiting for her family to show up before we moved her.‚Äù. I am 31 years old, she needed to inform no one. I realize they were going to keep me in that bed until the pain went away, I worry that the next nurse or doctor will be dismissive as well. I ready for battle, despite being barely able to speak at this point. I am so weak, I can't even walk, they decide to move my bed to the acute unit. Once there, I finally meet my savior. 

I've been in the hospital for 4 hours now, they give me stronger painkillers, I am so thirsty but am unable to drink water as one of the nurses says ‚ÄúShe might go for surgery, we need her to fast.‚Äù. At this point my mother is with me, holding my hand and I break down, the painkillers aren't working, I go into shock and repeatedly say ‚ÄòPlease help me, it hurts‚Äô for what seems like hours. I am deteriorating. The attending nurse comes in and is visibly concerned, he stays by my door as I continue downhills, he orders ultrasounds and Xrays. Here we go again.
I am taken to the ultrasound room, I am crying as the pain of the machine is unbearable, I begin to shake, the technician freaks out. Her superior comes in and does the test himself, pressing way too hard. I can't stand the pain and then he says the magic words ‚ÄúWhat is this? there a big mass on her left ovary‚Äù.I am relieved, finally an answer!, little did I know the seriousness and extent of the issue. I go back to my awesome nurse, he says they need a clearer image of what's going on, at this point, I'm so high, I hardly process what he is saying. He orders an MRI.

After 2-3 hours, I finally get wheeled out to the MRI, I have had so many different bags of painkillers IV, the pain dulls. Cue MRI, the pain soars to new heights again due to the heat the rays. I am back in my room, blood work comes back, I am in Diabetic Ketoacidosis, I'm immediately put in insulin and am so unstable at this point that the nurse request I am moved to the ICU to await the results of the MRI and keep my blood sugars under control. Everything is a whirlwind at this point, it's almost 2am, I haven't slept or eaten but the pain is somewhat controlled and for that I am grateful.

My family is tired and they leave, I am so thankful for their support. The OBGYN doctor shows up, she says ‚ÄúYou have a severe ovarian torsion caused by an 8cm tumor in the left ovary. I have never seen anything like this, it is also hemorrhagic and necrotic, we need to remove it.‚ÄùFINALLY! so it wasn't in my head, this wasn't a pain I could meditate away. This wasn't something that I was exaggerating. I am scheduled for surgery at 5:00am. RELIEF. (TBC)

17bh5em,WomensHealth,1697715733.0,"Hey everyone. I'm not sure if this is the sub to put this in but I think I'll give it a try. 

I (30F) have endometriosis which has made sex and orgasming painful for the last few years. More recently, I've developed something (potentially vaginismus?) that has made sex too painful to endure overall - I bleed, have tremendous pain that I can only describe as ripping, and this pain (as well as my pelvic pain) continue for days to weeks after any sexual intercourse. This pain has prevented me from initiating any kind of sexual activity because I am scared things will progress to intercourse which causes pain.

This is a deeply personal and embarassing matter. I haven't found anything that works for me as far as fixing my symptoms. The absolute only thing that will make me forget the pain is to drink to excess, which I know isn't healthy and isn't something I enjoy. My husband is at his wit's end. He has never been very supportive of this, has made snide comments about how I'm ""just not wet enough"" or I'm ""too tight"". He is now focusing on how we do not have a functioning marriage because we cannot be intimate and that I clearly ""have not tried hard enough"" to fix the issue.

Does anyone have any suggestions or ideas of where to turn? Is this something for a pelvic floor therapist? Are there doctors who specialize in this? My endo doctor is wonderful but recently moved out of state. I'm just trying to save my marriage before my husband leaves me for someone who isn't ""broken"".

16nr9yx,WomensHealth,1695231182.0,"I have been finding it difficult to find online support about post-abortion resentment, so I want to share about it on here. My long-distance boyfriend and I (both 25 y/o) had an abortion a year ago and I still struggle with resentment towards him for it. When we began dating, we agreed that we would have an abortion if we were not ready to have a child. It seemed like a reasonable promise to make. A few days after I learned I was pregnant, I began feeling intense grief and emotional pain. It felt like a door to another life (literally) had been cracked open, and that choosing to slam that door shut was the most painful thing I've ever experienced. I felt grief like someone was dying.  
My boyfriend listened and tried to be supportive, sitting with me on FaceTime for hours and sending groceries to my house. He wanted the abortion and had no difficulty with the decision. He had his college graduation the weekend I was having the abortion (medicated at home) and did not offer to skip it, or come to see me before the abortion. In his mind, he would be there after, and that was enough.  
So there I was -- naked, vomiting, fainting from pain, bleeding out a blood clot, utterly alone in my bathroom while he was walking across a stage.  
He came to see me the following week. We went to dinner, we were cozy, and we spent time together as normal. I felt ok, like my emotions had balanced out for the first time in weeks. But slowly, over time, I began to get angry. It started as confusion as to why he didn't talk to his family or friends (all very open-minded and supportive of him) about the abortion. It then turned to sadness that he wasn't here for the abortion, that he didn't share any of my pain. It then turned to rage, that he wasn't here, that it took him 9-months to apologize for not being here, that he never shed a tear about the experience, that he never took the initiative to read about it or bring it up in conversation with me. That as much as I asked him to share the weight of the healing, he never made an effort. Because it wasn't an important event in his life. It wasn't world-shaking to him like it was to me.  
It's now a year later, and that effort still isn't there. This is not me passing moral judgment on him -- he is smart, he is generous, he is kind. But it is me identifying a failure of empathy. And me sharing a deep hurt that this experience wasn't one of closeness and bonding, as it should have been.  
As much as I wish things were different, my abortion is not a life experience I would undo. It taught me how badly I want to have children and what a good mom I am going to be. It taught me about the bravery it takes to express real anger with someone. It was an act of love, even in its violence and pain.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/16nr9yx/a_year_after_abortion_experience_with_resenting/,"A Year After Abortion, Experience With Resenting My Boyfriend",,56,24,0.89,georgiarose77

His daughter(17) came out to just chat and hang out and it turned into a heavy discussion about abortion rights in the which I argued strongly for abortion rights. My partner‚Äôs daughter sort of sided with him arguing that she might not exist if her mom had had access to abortion. Abortion was available in their state at that time. My partner and his child‚Äôs mother didn‚Äôt make that choice. But I was arguing about how lack of access to abortion and legislation preventing abortion actually kills women. It got to a head when I told my partner fuck you and gave him double middle fingers and while I fucked off inside. I came back after a couple minutes and we discussed no more politics when I came back. 

Today (we both had Monday off for the holiday) I got up and cooked us breakfast late and cleared the dishes in the sink while I was doing it. The daughter was gone because she had work early and she‚Äôs off school now. So I start dinner around 1 on cooking a brisket, make salad, and some potatoes. Everything is ready when she gets home from work.  No one said thanks for dinner. 

We sit down to eat and she goes ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs on this?‚Äù

‚ÄúSalt and pepper‚Äù that was the dry rub I put on the brisket. 

D: ‚ÄúOk but is there anything else?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just salt and pepper.‚Äù

D: ‚ÄúDid you buy like salt and pepper from the store?‚Äù

I said pretty flatly ‚ÄúI took the salt and pepper out of the cabinet and mixed‚Äî-‚Äú

D:‚Äùok you don‚Äôt have to get an attitude with me‚Äî‚Äú

At which point I threw down my fork said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done.‚Äù And walked out of the house to go have what felt like a panic attack in the back yard. 

Like why am I invested and making effort to please someone who can‚Äôt even be pleased. Sunday her ride bailed on her take her to a graduation party half an hour away. I said I‚Äôd take her and pick her up but I knew her dad would be kinda upset about 2 hours of driving so I turned it into an outing where we got lunch somewhere and then we found some stuff to do before she needed to be picked up. 

I just don‚Äôt feel appreciated for the mental load (I‚Äôm familiar with the comic and have shared it with my partner). I feel like I‚Äôm doing all the work of a mother and getting zero acknowledgement. Which I can also understand. 17 yo daughters mom died 2 years ago. Which is brutally hard. My mom is also dead. 

Maybe I just want basic respect and not just feel like a cash register when someone needs something. 

She attempted to apologize to me but it was like a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre upset apology,‚Äù and tried to gaslight me that she was only asking because it was so good. Not her tone at the time. The tone was if I was secretly trying to sneak mustard into her food which she hates.  And I said to her attempted apology, ‚Äúyou can apologize to me or not. You don‚Äôt have to but that is not an apology.‚Äù 

Did I get too much in my own head and blow up? Or is a teenager telling me not to get an attitude with her over a dinner I cooked enough? Where do I go from here to reconcile these relationships?

yw24jw,WomensHealth,1668529777.0,"I know this is probably controversial for a few reasons, but the one that bothers me the most is thinking about how many women out there want to become mothers so badly but can't, or are struggling and putting themselves through so much to have a child. Then there's me (30F, heterosexual) and from all that I know am perfectly capable of having children, yet after years of being unsure if I did or didn't, have pretty much decided it isn't for me. I have reasons for my decision, and maybe they sound selfish. But kids are expensive, the world is overpopulated, life is hard, and I want to be able to do what I want when I want. I have a chronic illness that makes me extremely fatigued, and I have struggled with anxiety and depression as long as I can remember. I just don't think I have the energy to give children that I feel they deserve from a mother. 

Beyond that, my bigger fear is finding a man who wants to be a lifelong partner (something I have wanted to find my whole life) of a woman who doesn't want children. I've heard about the terrible things people have said to women who've made similar decisions, and I don't think I can take the scrutiny and cruelty. 

I guess what I'm really looking for here is for some validation and hearing from other women with similar stories and desires for their lives so that I don't feel like such a freak.

vjx80o,WomensHealth,1656101335.0,"For the past months and into last year, i have been having irregular bleeding when I am not menstruating. It has been frustrating to wash pair after pair of underwear because my uterus just decides to throw some old blood out willy-nilly. Pads have been used almost daily to avoid staining, but I am just so sick and done. I went to my Obgyn a few months ago and explained what was going on. She immediately scheduled an ultrasound to check my reproductive organs. That came back normal. She suggests I go on a BC, but I don't want to deal with the side effects if I don't need to (I am not sexually active, and never have been). I am informed there is a micro-dose and yada yada I should think about it. She asks if I would like to do a blood test. Sure! Let's check my hormones. The blood test comes back and it's just a blood panel of white blood cells, red blood cells and all that. I was a bit shocked, but oh well, I can just schedule a hormone panel later.

Timeskip to now, I just had my worst spotting yet. It lasted 2 weeks and even ran into the start of my period. I contacted my GP and they said they could get me in in 2 months. I really didn't want to wait that long to get a simple blood test done so I scheduled an appointment to get blood drawn with my obgyn. Before we finalized the appointment, my provider tried to push the idea of the low-dose pill again. I said I wanted to think about it more and wait for the results to come back. So, I went in last week and got my blood drawn. The weekend went and I then called Tuesday afternoon to ask if they had my results yet since blood test results usually come back quick (in my experience). They said they did but my provider hadn't looked them over. Fast forward to today, I call and they still haven't looked over them. Now, I understand that things get busy but I've never had blood test results take this long. I thought something might have gone wrong. or communications had fallen, etc. I thank the receptionist for her time and not even 5 minutes later, I get a call back. She relays the message from my provider that my results came back normal.

I'm going to be honest, I cried. Not out of relief, but out of frustration. This whole situation has made me want to pull my hair out and scream. I'm mad that my provider wanted to just shove me on a pill instead of doing more testing. I'm mad it took me a week of waiting and me having to call them twice  to initiate the process of letting me know I was fine when it obviously took less than 10 minutes to review/interpret my results. If nothing is wrong, then why am I having issues? I am not pregnant, my reproductive organs look normal on ultrasounds, my hormones are in their respective ranges, and I am at a point where my period should have settled into a rhythm (I've had my menstrual cycle for years).

 I get cysts fairly often around my upper thighs or groin but lately they keep coming up on my vagina in different parts.  I had a similar one over Christmas.  It's very frustrating.   I wash with an antiseptic ointment that my doctor recommended but they still come up.  

I wear wick underwear to avoid getting too damp down there as I sweat a lot and suspect getting too sweaty down there encourages bacteria that leads to cysts.

I'm too embarrassed to get it lanced and figure it will eventually burst on its own and then will stop hurting.  I've been putting antiseptic cream on  it as in the past this has helped hurry it along as far as bursting.

Does anyone else have this problem?  Usually if sn area of my body gets cysts, like my upper thighs, there might be an outbreak of two or three cysts for a month or so but then it stops.  But these cysts on my vjj have been going on since Christmas.  My doctor gives me antibiotics and to use the ointment when showering but these don't really seem to help.

*UPDATE 
Thankyou for everyone's responces, they convinced me to get it lanced.

I was friends with a woman for quite some time (about ten years), and we'd drift in and out of each other's lives. We always had a connection and kept in touch for the last 10 years.

Things changed and she ended up moving close to me, we became best friends in such a short time. There was such a strong bond between us, on a deep soul sister level.

I had never quite connected with another woman in that way, and it felt so refreshing to have this female connection in a friendship that I longed for my whole life. We were the highest priorities in each others' lives in the ways that matter, and we had a shit ton of fun together, even if just talking about life.

-

Then one day she was gone. I had met a wonderful guy, she had met a wonderful girl, our lives were changing. For a while we maintained the friendship even though we couldn't necessarily share the time we had shared for so many years.

But things changed, and it was suddenly days, then months that we hadn't talked. Maybe we're both to blame, I don't know. I wrote her a letter a few months ago before I moved out of the area, recounting those facts, and offering an olive branch to save the friendship.

-

 I never heard back.

-

I had always heard that you will lose a lot of friendships in your 30s. I guess it didn't really bother me because at most, I felt the people around me were acquaintances at best until I met her.

This one hurts. This one I have nightmares over, and I keep blaming myself. I know that life brings everyone in different directions, but I can't seem to shake this hurt from losing my best friend, and in that hurt is a looming fear that I will never connect with another woman like that again.

iuq2ut,TwoXSupport,1600369525.0,"I‚Äôm part of this organization at my college (professional fraternity) and through it, I‚Äôve met a lot of cool people. One of these people (I thought) was this guy, ‚ÄúMark.‚Äù Mark is kinda conservative, and can be a bit of an ass, but in general, I thought he was a decent guy. He‚Äôs been nice to me, and helped me with my writing, and he really aided a friend of mine when she got drunk at a party - he made sure she got home safely, and when it became clear that she had an alcohol problem, he helped her get sober. The other night, he FaceTimed me quite drunk, and was very complimentary. I didn‚Äôt think it was creepy at the time, just kinda sweet. It wasn‚Äôt anything about my appearance, just me being a good person and nice and stuff. During the conversation, I said something about missing seeing him at chapter, and that we should get coffee or something. I don‚Äôt really remember, it was casual.

Anyway, today I was talking to one of my other friends from the group, and she ended up telling me that she had to stop being friends with Mark (they had been close), because he asked her out and got really combative and weird when she said no. On top of that, they had to work together on future projects (we‚Äôre in a collaborative major) and his behavior to her has stayed kinda hostile and weird. He‚Äôs made oddly sexual comments towards her and around her - lots of stuff with ‚Äúplausible deniability,‚Äù but clearly targeted. He also wrote a script with a main character that‚Äôs clearly based on him, and a ‚Äúlove interest‚Äù that‚Äôs obviously her, and in the script, he SHOOTS her when he gets with another guy. He‚Äôs also been trying to get close to her roommate, even though historically he couldn‚Äôt stand her. 

Obviously this has changed my perspective on him, and I no longer feel comfortable hanging out with Mark. However, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs done anything to me personally, and even though he‚Äôs clearly not a great person, part of me feels bad for just ghosting him. I have to, but still...ugh.

It also puts some of his past behavior in a weird and concerning light. Like, my friend and I share a name (think ‚ÄúLily‚Äù and ‚ÄúLilli‚Äù) and the night he drunk-called me, he said I was ‚Äúhis favorite Lily.‚Äù At the time, I‚Äôd thought he was making a joke about the spelling - l‚Äôm the only Lily.

inhet1,WomensHealth,1599374585.0,"Hi there. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking this. Please give me advice as I‚Äôm mentally tearing myself apart here.

Background: me and my partner have been together for 5 years, I‚Äôm 21 and he is 22. We have been sexually active nearly everyday for 3 of those 5 years. We are each others firsts, and I haven‚Äôt been with another person ever. I‚Äôve never had a baby either. 

My partner once called me ‚Äúloose‚Äù after engaging in sexual activity once many moons ago (2 years ago). Now that has stuck in my head since that day. And makes me crave reassurance after every time we have sex to see whether or not he actually enjoyed it. When I asked him why he said that, he said he was angry that day and wanted to be petty; and didn‚Äôt mean to say that. (He used to be pretty toxic back then). He‚Äôs never said it since until today.

Enjoying sex for me has now become totally dependent on whether or not my partner comes fast. For some reason in my head, I believe that if he comes fast = I have a nice+tight vag. Sometimes if he takes longer to cum, I start to overthink that my pussy feels loose and that‚Äôs why he can‚Äôt orgasm. It‚Äôs a Fucked up mentality, but it‚Äôs my reality. 

Now yesterday, my partner and I had sex for quite a while. I was leading up to my Period. (I just got it today, which is why I was a bit drier than usual) He came quite quickly the first round, but we went straight into another round in which he took longer to cum (20 minutes). During the actual second round of sex, I could feel myself not generating enough natural ‚Äòlubrication‚Äô, thus it was very dry at times, and I couldn‚Äôt really feel him, but it still felt OK. We didn‚Äôt have lube on hand, so he kept using his spit.

Now I asked my partner today, how it felt last night, during second round. In which he replied, ‚Äúwhen you‚Äôre extremely dry, it feels loose. It feels much better when you‚Äôre wet‚Äù. Now I don‚Äôt know how to interpret this, because I always thought if you were dry (not aroused) it would feel tighter for a guy? Not the opposite? Does this mean I have a loose vagina? I just need advise as I really don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm losing the plot. I‚Äôve always looked at cosmetic (vaginal) surgery such as vaginal tightening because of what he said 2 years ago. I don‚Äôt know if this is a stupid idea and would affect me giving natural birth in the future. I used to be quite skinny in our first years together, but now I‚Äôm at my heaviest weight of 198 pounds. Could this affect the tightness of my vagina? I have no self esteem whatsoever. I hate myself entirely really. I hate who I see in the mirror. 

I‚Äôve heard of kegals. Usually I can stop peeing midstream, but I find that sometimes if I sneeze or laugh with a full bladder, a little bit escapes me. Which would mean I‚Äôd need to train with kegals right? 

Please be nice in your responses as I‚Äôm in tears writing this. What do I do. Should I do more kegals? Lose weight? Am I interpreting this wrong?

hoijuk,WomensHealth,1594355680.0,"After 5 months of trying off and on with my partner we were finally able to get a dildo inside me! Due to possible trauma or otherwise, I was only ever able to get myself up to two fingers after endless trying and stretching because my fear made me tighten so badly that when anything phallic shaped went near me I tightened up. The best we ever got was one time we managed to get the head in but I was in great pain. 

But, after some time and my partner offering one day, we decided to try out anal for a change which after some stretching I even began to enjoy some. And yeah there was still fear at first but not as much because of the smooth nature of the dilator set we bought and the fact it wasn't in my vagina. We were even able to get up to a dildo before stopping. Which I think the fact I was able to have a dildo in me without pain and even some pleasure really helped me with my fear. 

Later when we were getting a little heated my partner asked if I wanted to try the dildo again. I was very apprehensive but agreed to try. With extreme focus on remaining relaxed and trying to focus on anything else but what was happening we were both delighted as it just slipped in! We were ecstatic and were able to use the smaller dildo one to its fullest extent where I could now also fully acknowledge what was happening and enjoy it as well. We even moved up to the next size we owned I even got a little carried away when given full control.

....

Mobile user, etc

...

So, I'm in the UK, but obviously the recent news in America of Roe Vs Wade has spread far and wide. And it's disturbing.

When I was 16, I had a boyfriend who was 32 (for those not great at maths or school ages etc, I was in secondary school, year 11, or 10th grade/sophomore) and the legal age for consent here is 16. That didn't change the fact that my bf at the time was literally double my age.

We had been dating for a while and had an active sex life. One of those days, the condom split, I didn't realise and I missed my period. I was terrified.

(And yes, he probably noticed the condom had split when he withdrew and took it off, but didn't feel the need to tell me.)

I then had to go to the local sexual health clinic, embarrassed and scared, with a black eye (from a separate event, but it didn't look great), pee in a cup and have a stranger dip a bit of paper in it, stare at me for an uncomfortable length of time, then get told that I was pregnant. The woman then tested it again, just in case and sat me down to ask me about my eye, my bf, my situation and tell me what my options were.

I had to explain that my dad would literally have killed my bf and I would suffer for many more years at both the hands and voice of my father and being trapped with a baby and an inappropriate partner. At the age of 16.

She was very caring, organising tissues and face wipes, then booked all the appointments for me, gave me maps and advice, a hug and dried my never-ending tears.

A few weeks later, I had to go to a town more than an hour's drive away (Brighton) for my initial appointment, where a large male doctor with an uncaring attitude told me that if girls like me didn't want babies, we should be responsible about it. I was in tears as this man with large, unsympathetic hands 'checked' me. One hand had to be put inside me, while the other was pressed on my stomach, to feel what was going on in there. Then he threw a ball of tissue at me, told me to clean up and that I was indeed pregnant. He would confirm my appointment for the next fortnight.

I had to go all the way home, scared, ashamed, embarrassed and in pain, then come back a fortnight later. A nurse gave me a leaflet, told me I should have been responsible if I was going to have sex. I explained, again, that the condom had split and my bf hadn't told me. She snorted and told me I should have been more responsible for my actions. I said I was; I was 16, in school, had broken up with my crappy bf and was now having to go through all of this and the accusations to fix my life.

I was given general anesthetic, 'cleaned out' and woken up several hours later. I found out what blood group I was, I found out who my friends really were. (One started spreading a rumour that I had paid doctors to keep me in the back so I had an easier way to break up with my bf.)

That was my experience, but if I had been told that despite taking precautions and my bf being stupid/lying, that I would have to carry the baby of a grown man who fucked teenagers, then be tied to a baby/adoption guilt for the rest of my life, I would have killed myself.

I was 16 and I would rather have died than risk being a mother or having a baby at all.

But now, women in the same or worse situations are being told that legally, because of middle aged white men who don't even know how women's bodies work, they can go to jail for trying to do the best for everybody involved. And every body involved. A fetus is not living/does not have working internal organs before 24 weeks, which is why that's the UK limit.

A fetus born before 24 weeks has little to no chance of survival, even with medical intervention, a large amount of internal organs simply haven't formed, or formed properly. Born after 24 weeks, with medical intervention, a fetus may survive (may, not will. It's still a gamble.) That limit was set around 1967, yet the USA seems to have tried to step back even further in time than that and it's disgraceful.

That's not even looking at a baby born into poverty, abuse, hatred and everything else.

I met up with my online boyfriend for the first time, that night we had sex together. I lost my virginity that night.

Fast forward, 3 days later I fly back home, thinking the burning and pain in my vagina was all just due to losing my virginity.

It continues, so painful to the point that i decided to go to an OBGYN. They told me I had BV and prescribed me the retched Metronidazole.

Then a week later I was ‚Äúcured‚Äù and was feeling much better. Then a month later I went to see my boyfriend again, and guess what happened. Boom, BV again, so I went to the OBGYN and was prescribed the same thing.

Another month passes, I got to see my boyfriend again, same thing happens.

Everytime I saw my partner I would get BV after sex. 

Eventually, we decided to move in together. That‚Äôs when it got so much worse.

Sex everyday, BV twice a month. This has lasted 5 months.

My mental health is down to the floor. I‚Äôm in pain, my boyfriend is sexually frustrated, and I feel disgusting.

I am new to this sub so I apologize I'm advance if I make any errors in that regard. I also want to apologize for the gruesome details. Additionally, I want to say that I am not asking for medical advice just more so asking if anyone else has been through a similar story. I mostly wanted to vent so this is going to be a long post. 

I (31F) have had quite the rough go of it these past few weeks. I had been experiencing heavy bleeding with large clots since May 17th (today's date June 10). It got progressively worse with large plum-orange sized clots for the two days before my gynecologists appointment last Thursday. Now I want to say, my gyno and I never really seemed to ""jive"" well. He was always nonchalant and when I had a complication with my Mirena IUD (it self ejected), his response was along the lines of ""Huh, that's weird that never happens. Let's try a new birth control."" This was 3 months ago and I am currently on an oral contraceptive.

Anyway, I went to my gyno on Thursday and explained what was going on to the nurse - that I had such heavy bleeding and need to change feminine products that it even impacted my sleep. I was changing a S tampon/pad combo every 40 mins-1 hour. I explained that I was frustrated and utterly exhausted. When the doctor came in he said ""no exam today, let's just talk"". So we went into his office and he told me he wanted to try a new birth control. I was appalled. I was like ""that is not why I am here! Something is wrong I shouldn't be bleeding like this!"" I had to ask him for follow up testing which he complied by scheduling a sonohysterogram/tissue biopsy for the end of the month. I had to again ask what we can do about the bleeding and he prescribed me Megace. I felt completely unheard but went back to work.

I work a very hands on job in a psych hospital, I went to meet with a patient and found I could not concentrate. I ended the session and had to lay down. When I walked back to my office I was light headed and my heart rate spiked. My lovely coworkers convinced me to go to the ER and drove me there (I'm a bit stubborn and wouldn't have gone myself). At the ER my hemoglobin was just above the threshold of needing a transfusion so I got two bags of IV fluid. My heartrate had somewhat improved so I was sent home with instructions to take the medication to stop the bleeding.

The next day I returned to work. I started my day by having to take a 1-2 minute walk to one of the buildings I work at and my heartrate shot to 176, I was dizzy and I had to catch my breath. I probably should have gone back to the ER at that point but again, I am stubborn. So I went home. 

When I woke up Saturday any pigment of color was now gone from my face, my lips were white and the bleeding had only improved in that the clots were now golf ball sized. I went back to the ER and my hemoglobin levels had tanked to the point of needing a blood transfusion. I stayed overnight. They gave me an IV medication (TXA) which stopped the bleeding within the hour! And prescribed me progesterone to continue from home to assist with making sure the bleeding remains stopped.

The doctor at the hospital instructed me to get my sonohysterogram/biopsy pushed up to as soon as possible as she is worried there is more than just a hormonal cause to the bleeding. This is scheduled for today. I was discharged Sunday. 

So I have been home... weak from the blood loss but recovering. I go to my procedure today... but last night, even after all this, the bleeding returned. Not nearly as heavy but almost like a ""normal"" period level. I'm frustrated and scared but hopeful to get some answers soon. Thank you for reading my story.

TL;DR: 3 weeks of vaginal bleeding landed me in the hospital with a blood transfusion.

UPDATE:
Hi everyone, I just want to thank you all for your responses and stories. I will try to spend some time getting back to your responses today. I was sad to see that many of you had experienced something similar. I wish all of you well. 
As for me, while I did not have my official review of my results as of yet- it does look like I have a either a 3cm fibroid or polyp which will need to be removed. It's weird that this feels like good news because it validated what I knew all along before I started this birth control process- something else is up.
I had also mentioned this in a few of the comments, but I had switched from my frustrating OB to the attending who had treated me in the hospital. She has been wonderful and pushing this process along quickly. 
For those who arent as lucky, please make sure you advocate! Dont sit around and wait! I had only dealt with this for a short time but many of you have dealt with it longer. You know your bodies. The reason I ended up in the hospital was because my stubborn mental state and not wanting to make a big deal about menstrual bleeding. Between that, and my doctor not realizing the signs. 
I wish you all the best of health and can absolutely update along the process. And mostly, thank you. I felt very alone through this and many of your comments, while many were heartbreaking, also provided me some comfort.

The loudest voice you register, in your mind, is one shouting feelings of incompetence.

You‚Äôre unable to hear the truth.

Worse, you're unable to accept the encouragement of people who believe in you.

Research shows that three areas that result in someone struggling with feeling like an imposter:

* Upbringing,
* Personality,

t7ycww,WomensHealth,1646571965.0,"I guess this is a PSA by sharing what I am currently going through. 

For the last year I've been having period issues. Was on the pill for 2 years when it started to not work. I'd get my period prior to the placebo week and it would lightly last longer. I had gained weight and thought it's just the wrong dose. My gynecologist thought that I just became used to it. Together we decided to try the IUD (Kyleena). Well I put up with it for 4 months. Worst cramping ever to the point I didn't sleep and would be rendered unable to move until the pain passed. Added to that I had heavy periods. It was to the point that the last 10 weeks I had it I bleed steadily. I finally got it removed in August. 

Since then my periods have been out of whack. 2 weeks of heavy bleeding. Going through size 2 pads in 1-2 hours. Clumps that were quarter sized. Cramping. Then I'd get 1 to 2 weeks no bleeding. Then it would start up again. From all readings and talking to my PCP this is normal for 6 months to a year from getting an IUD removed. 

Cut to 3 weeks ago. I had the worst period of my life. Passed a clot the size of a baseball. It got to the point where I almost passed out. Spent a day in the hospital. Had  CT scan, transvaginal ultrasound, blood tests. It all came back that I have a thick lining of the uterus. 

The next day I got a same day appointment with my gyno. I almost waited 2 months to get in with the gyno the doctor wanted me to see, but my husband insisted I call mine, thankful to this man. My gyno was thinking it was endometrial hyperplasia. Which is a thickening of the uterus. Its rare, but symptoms fit. She did a biopsy (extremely paintlful btw, insist on meds if you ever have to have one) to make sure and get  testing as there are 4 types of endometrial hyperplasia. 

Last week I got those results. Turns out its not that, but rather it is cancer. Adenocarcinoma of the uterus. My doctor was shocked. It wasn't even on the radar. At the appointment she said she didn't think it is cancer and she had a look around my uterus. 

I have an appointment with a gynecological oncologist this upcoming week. I dont yet know what stage. I don't know the exact type. I don't know if it spread. But I will have a hysterectomy to make sure the cancer is gone. I'm scared. I'm grieving. I'm in shock. And I hate waiting without answers. 

PSA: Advocate for yourself. Don't brush it off when your body is behaving differently. Doing different things than before. It might be nothing. Might be an easy fix. But don't put it off. For that time that it is something serious getting it taken care of early just might save your life. It's what I'm hoping for right now.

WELL. a couple weeks into taking it I'm experiencing constant and extreme hunger. It occurred to me that it could be fenugreek-related so I went off it. my period rolls around and it's barely a period; no cramps and extremely light. My hunger cravings petered out but were replaced by a LACK of appetite, brain fog, fatigue and....extremely persistent bloating, mostly in my lower stomach. i cut out gluten to see if i had an intolerance and saw no change. i would go to bed bloated, wake up bloated. i exercised, ate less, ate slower, took gas medicine, nothing, no change, still bloated. bowel movements normal. 2 preg tests say negative, i get my dookie tested for parasites, thyroid levels checked, nothing amiss, no one has a clue.

2 weeks after my last weird non-period and I'm bleeding again, heavier now but still lighter than a normal period. almost no cramps except a slight intermittent pain on my lower left side. suddenly my symptoms seem to be adding up to a big fat ovarian cyst, and what do i find? taking hormone-based medicine meant to stimulate fertility and ovulation can cause these.

I'm not 100% sure yet, but I have a gyn appointment on Friday and I have pretty good instincts about my body. even if it's not a cyst, my hormones are very clearly out of whack. don't be an idiot like me and start popping supplements because people on tiktok said it was a good idea. this has been genuinely nightmarish.

I stopped taking it as soon as I started noticing adverse effects and as a person who regularly consumes alcohol (literal poison) like most people of my age group the world over, an herbal supplement didn't seem that risky :) just because there are limited studies on something doesn't mean there should be and I'm tired of potentially beneficial supplements, particulary with regards to women's health, not being allocated any funding for research. def going to ask my doctor next time before adding anything into the daily routine but if you feel the need to scold me, scroll onwards.

pb0az8,TwoXSupport,1629852198.0,"TW: abusive relationship

The past year + has been so horrible and traumatizing for me personally, completely aside from covid, it has been possibly the most challenging year of my life. And I watched my parent lose a battle with cancer a few years ago. 

This past year my life has been marred by an abusive relationship that I escaped, and a police investigation against said abuser. I have been trying so hard to tackle my traumatic experiences head on, and I have been lucky enough to receive a lot (a *lot*) of professional support. But almost always I feel emotionally drained. 

More recently the sessions with my counsellors have run out (free service because police investigation) and I have not had the time, energy or good luck to have found a replacement yet. Among everything else I went back to school full time last year in order to finish my degree, and since the Spring have been juggling two jobs. The sudden lack of professional support in my life has made me starkly aware once again about how little emotional support I have in my personal life. It's really defeating. 

I am just so tired of expending *so* much energy having to get up everyday and give myself a pep talk, and constantly taking breaks so I don't completely fall apart. I wish that someone could acknowledge how much I have managed to accomplish in the past year: finishing school, and getting my first positions in my field, all while enduring this horrible police process. And covid on top on that! 

A few days ago I finished one of my last major research projects for my school, and it was a huge culmination of work over the past few months. I got so many extensions on it because my mental health was suffering so much, and I really got to the point where I didn't think I could do it- but I finished it!! It's amazing and I'm so proud of myself, but I just wish someone else could be too. 

I live with my mom right now, and I told her the next morning that I was finally done this huge project that I had been talking about daily for months, and was so glad and so relieved. All she said was, ""That must feel good"" and didn't even look up at her phone. I felt like leaving the table and walking out of the room and crying. I just want to be seen. 

As much as I'm glad to be single in order to heal, I have really been missing having a partner lately as someone who I can celebrate with. Maybe I will start trying to ask a little more of my friends, in subtle ways, and sharing more.

I cannot feel a thing during intercourse/oral/etc. No sensation whatsoever, even if i dig my nail into the walls of my vagina I feel nothing, same on the clitoris.

To rule out anything medical I recently saw a GP about this and they sent me to a sex therapist, I didn't get anything out of it so I was then referred to a gynaecologist who said everything looked normal and swabs came back fine. I then got a blood test and the only thing my doctor told me was my SHBG was high and that was it. I then also had an ultrasound (uss pelvic ta + uss kub) and they came back fine as well. I am at a loss, as is my doctor and I am unsure how to proceed. My last option is pelvic floor physiotherapy which I have booked. All up these appointments and going back and forth with my GP has cost me over $1000 and I am starting to lose hope.

fs3mhh,WomensHealth,1585617715.0,"Hi all! I am new to reddit and do not fully understand the layout. I am here to see if anyone has had a similar experience to me because I have talked to many of my sexual experienced friends and NO ONE knows what I am talking about.

Long story short last week (Monday) I lost my virginity to a friend. I am a 22 year old female and he is a 22 year old male. Despite being comfortable with him I was incredibly nervous. I have many bodily insecurities and even though I know he likes me and wanted to hook up I couldn't help but feel incredibly exposed. I am a small girl (115 lbs) and he is a bigger guy (170? lbs). I mention this for later context.

Anyways, we were making out and he asked if we wanted to move to the bedroom. Before doing so I told him it was my first time just so he could be aware that I DID NOT know what I was doing. We start getting busy and next thing I know I see his penis... it was huge, I'm talking 8 inches huge. He was using MAGNUM condoms. Me being a tiny girl, about to lose her virginity in a room with the lights on, to a man with a penis that is too big, I became even more anxious. Everything was one hundred million percent consensual and he repeatedly told me that I was in control of how far we went. I knew I wanted to have sex with him but did not know what to expect.

Basically what ended up happening was I tried to give him a BJ but I was literally to scared of messing up that I just told him to fuck me. We flip over and the second he puts himself inside me I am in the most excruciating pain of my entire life. My legs began trembling/shaking like I had tremors because of how much pain I was in. I could not stop screaming (but this was taken as enjoyment). I genuinely thought I was going to die but I did not say anything because I was just happy to be having sex and I THOUGHT this was normal virginity pain. He finishes, we lie there and then 10 mins later he is ready to go again. Somehow this time i ended up on top. The PAIN this time was even worse and I could not stop the tears from coming out of my eyes (but i did not let him see). I was on top but my legs were chattering like cold teeth in hypothermia from the pain so much that I collapsed on his body and could not move. I still thought at this point that the pain could have been normal. I leave and called all my friends so excited to tell them I finally did it but everyone listened to my story in horror. Even my friend who have had sex with dozens of guys had never experienced this...   

Our conclusions were just that because I was so nervous I was not wet and because it was my first time and I am small his dick was just too big.

4 days pass and I am still in pain so I decide to look in a mirror. When I did I saw blood where the vagina meets the crack (although I had never peed blood). Anyways of course I freak out and start googling. I very quickly realize I have a first-degree vaginal tear. I was not too worried until I learned how women typically receive these, from childbirth or sexual assault. Many articles/forums said this rarely occurs from consensual sex. But I had consensual sex TWICE with this tear as I lost my VIRGINITY. The next morning I was lucky enough to have an emergency Gyno appointment (this was on Friday) and she tells me that I have a trauma vaginal tear. The Dr. tells me that this most likely happened immediately at the point of insertion because there was no foreplay and as I continued to have sex I made it worse. She told me thankful I dont need stitches... STITCHES.   

As you can tell by this long and frantic post I am freaking out. I really like this guy and actually already told him what happened. (Just that i have a tear not the details of pain or how). The Dr. said to wait two weeks and then I may be able to have sex again.

The point of this post is because I cannot find a single woman with this shared experience. I feel like a dumbass for not saying anything because he would have been so understanding. I feel stupid for hurting myself so bad. I feel weak. And mostly, I feel stunted. It no longer hurts but now I am incapable of being turned on. I have been trying to masturbate to make sure everything is ok and its not. I literally cannot get turned on or even come close to orgasming. I literally traumatized myself and cry while trying to force myself to watch porn. I really like this guy and want to have sex with him - we text all day everyday and he cannot wait for the next time. But I dont know how I can do that or where to go from here. The pain from that night haunts me. 

Has ANYONE ever had a vaginal tear from sex? How did you physically or emotionally get over it??? Please and thank you. Im sorry this is so long.

fc5k1s,WomensHealth,1583118129.0,"I'm curious to hear from the peanut gallery (because try as I might I haven't been able to find many ""legitimate"" sources documenting women's experiences specifically of health concerns limited to the female body) whether any of you have a story you would like to share regarding the way the medical community has reacted/dealt with a health problem that affected your ""lady bits"".

During my journey with chronic pelvic pain, I went from someone with total faith in the healthcare system (I was a naive sixteen-year-old) who trusted her doctors' opinions automatically to a broken young woman searching desperately around the internet for answers, and finally to a knowledgeable and self-reliant advocate for my own health. During my many attempts to find other women like me out there, I discovered through blogs and forum posts that I was definitely not alone in the pain I was experiencing or in feeling abandoned by the medical field. I read countless accounts of women who had been passed around from specialist to specialist like a hot potato, given everything from high dose antibiotics to antipsychotics by doctors who admittedly couldn't definitively diagnose the problem (but hey, it was worth a shot!). And the scary thing is that those were the lucky ones. Others were flat-out dismissed, ignored, referred to psychiatrists, or told ""Maybe you should get pregnant, that might sort you out."" Some were even given unnecessary surgery that resulted in sterilization. These women suffered from a wide range of symptoms from what was obviously a wide range of disorders: vulvar pain, chronic vaginitis, sharp pain deep in the pelvis, a feeling of heaviness in the pelvis, vaginismus, vaginal atrophy, etc. However, they all had two things in common: Their complaints were seemingly ""idiopathic"" and they had all at one time or another been told that it was probably ""all in their heads.""

Now, I am a strong believer in the power of the mind-body connection, but I find it bewildering that when a woman goes to her doctor for pain relating to her reproductive organs, her symptoms are likely to be assumed to be psychological rather than relating to the actual location of the pain, or even physical at all. It's as if those who enter the medical field are trained to hear ""vagina"" and immediately think ""emotions"". Some probably even more specifically think ""anxiety"" or ""depression"", or, even more unfortunately, ""attention-seeker"". Conversely, if a man goes in for pain with urination or prostate pain, he is not likely to leave his doctor's office with a prescription for Zoloft, regardless of whether the origin of the pain could be successfully identified.

The discrepancy between the way general medical complaints of men are treated as opposed to those of women (especially women of color) is worrying enough. But add in the traditionally taboo subject of female genitals, and the gap gets even wider. It is an area that both doctors and patients have a tendency to have numerous misconceptions about, and SO many women have spent years in silent agony, misdiagnosed, ashamed and psychologically damaged (ironic) as a result. This is something that we need to talk about. MORE.

If you have an experience to share relating to how a mysterious ""female problem"" you have had was handled (or not) by the healthcare system, a message of hope and success with any recommendations as to what channels and resources women who are suffering can utilize, or you just want to commiserate, the floor is yours.

1c3zdnv,WomensHealth,1713116816.0,"So, last week, I went in to have an IUD inserted. 

I have severe OCD and one of my biggest fears is getting pregnant. Due to this extreme fear, me and my fiance (together for 6yr) haven‚Äôt been able to have penetrative sex. I was hoping that if I got an IUD, which is 99.9% effective, we could finally overcome this hurdle and could have a normal sex life. 

The doctor told me that I would probably get some cramps‚Äîlike bad period cramps. And that I should take advil an hour before. But that there would be no issues with me driving home after my appointment and the cramps should go away after a few days. I get pretty severe periods to begin with, so I figured it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal and went for it.

The insertion hurt and the ‚Äúcervical measurement‚Äù was DEFINITELY more than a pinch and little cramp, but ok. It was over. 

After the appointment, I was feeling a little crampy, but otherwise fine. Within 30 minutes, I started getting the most intense cramps I have ever had in my life ‚Äîmind you, I‚Äôve had by fibula split in half and stretched 3in and these cramps were by far worse. 

I couldn‚Äôt make it home because I had to pull over and vomit every three minutes. I called my fiance to come pick me up and we could barely get home because I was writhing and vomiting constantly. 

Finally, I called my gyno and asked if this was normal and got kind of a ‚Äúshrug, if the pain was too severe she guessed I could go to the er‚Äù. 

Well, my fiance made that choice for me and took me to the er, where I proceeded to vomit and dry heave for a day and a half until the nurses decided to remove the IUD. Within hours, I was feeling better, but ended up spending 3 days in the hospital due to the severity of my symptoms.

**My experience:**

So on the 21st of April I found out I was pregnant - I had a scan 2 days ago and was 6 weeks and 2 days, and that's the day I started my abortion process.So 2 days ago, I took the first pill which is called mifepristone, and I did experience some mild stomach pains on that day and yesterday and some tiredness, but nothing crazy. With this pill, most people experience either no symptoms or just mild pains like I did, or maybe some spotting.Yesterday I took misoprostol, which are the pills you dissolve either vaginally or buccally. I chose to do them vaginally as I read that dissolving them buccally is more likely to make you vomit or have diharrea, and I just felt vaginally would be easier. I took the first 4 tablets of misoprostol 24 hours after I took the mifepristone, and then 2 more misoprostol tablets 3 hours later.I'm not going to lie, yesterday was absolute agony - I think maybe the worst physical pain I've ever experienced. It started with a kind of tingling feeling in the stomach area and then some cramps coming on and then it quite quickly developed into just such intense and deep pains, I wouldn't even compare it to period cramps tbh because my period cramps can be quite bad, but this was honestly just a completely different kind of pain. I could barely even talk and couldn't move and the pains were just so strong and bad and would take over and it was just awful. I was taking codeine as well as paracetamol and literally nothing was touching the pain. I don't mean to put anyone off who may be about to go through this, but I just thought I'd keep it honest. It was like 6 non-stop hours of just the most immense pain.

On the bright side, my pains are already SO much better today! By yesterday evening, I was having short periods of having the really bad pains, but then they would ease and it wouldn't be that bad for a bit. They kind of completely eased in time for when I went to bed so I actually managed to have a good sleep last night and today I've barely had any pain! Some underlying cramps, but more just like mild period cramps today. Last night though, I had a dream that someone from my school was about to go through an abortion and I told her all about it and the process and everything, probably because I've been reading so much about it and explaining the process to so many people lately, and then I also dreamed that I expelled the foetus and then held it which is quite sad.

I do feel like I've been quite moody today though? Like feeling down and insecure and stuff, I felt that after taking the mifepristone too - has anyone else experienced this? Not sure if it's just the abortion experience as a whole or if the abortion pills actually physically cause moodiness? It's obviously normal to not be feeling great when going through an abortion anyway. As for the bleeding, I have been bleeding heavily and have seen some clotting.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Anyway, that's my experience with the abortion so far - the nurse I saw the other day told me I could be bleeding for up to 8 weeks, and she told me no sex or exercise for 3, and said not to use tampons on the bleeding either.

As I said in the beginning, I'd love to hear some of your stories if you're comfortable with sharing! Whether that's your experience of the process, how you were treated, your feelings towards it, etc, and whether you have been through an abortion, are going through one right now, or are about to, please feel free to ask me any questions at all as I will be happy to answer anything!

129v7uf,WomensHealth,1680463428.0,"I got an IUD about a year and a half ago, and the insertion was really really bad. I have a high pain tolerance so I just muscled through it and I left the doctor‚Äôs office about 15 minutes after the insertion was complete. 
The biggest problem was that I didn‚Äôt think to have someone drive me, I drove myself there, so I just drove myself back. I almost passed out twice on the way home and almost wrecked as well. I was in excruciating pain for hours after, to the point I couldn‚Äôt move and was just sobbing. 
I know this may sound dramatic but when I think about having it inside my uterus I just get so anxious and panic. I want to get it out, but I‚Äôm too scared to even go get it out.

y3z80w,WomensHealth,1665766610.0,"(Long post. Tldr at the end)

I (20F) got my period at 9 years old. Since then it has been regular as clockwork every single month -but that is about the only thing that goes right with it. (The next rant will be a bit tmi, fair warning)

I have a plethora of chronic health conditions that mean I cannot take birth control and that often make my menstrual symptoms worse. I‚Äôd say for the last 5 years or so, my symptoms have slowly become completely unbearable. I experience cramps so badly they make me violently ill. Sometimes they come in waves so bad that I have to hold my breath/writhe in agony/bash my head against a wall. I‚Äôve dealt with chronic pain all my adult life so it‚Äôs fair to say that I have a very high pain tolerance but these cramps are on another level. 

I know I have cysts, but no doctor I‚Äôve spoken to thinks that this is even serious enough to have the size of them tested/have them removed. Even when speaking to female doctors I‚Äôm always told ‚Äúall young women experience menstrual cramps‚Äù and I‚Äôm really at my wits end. I think last resort I just need my ovaries removed. I‚Äôve already been told that with my health I can never safely have my own children and I don‚Äôt want any kids anyway. But no doctor will listen. 

I struggle to pass my uterine lining so badly that my vagina will literally dilate as far as 7cm. My hips move places (I have hip dips and they literally fill in when I‚Äôm on my period) whatever is causing this pain is also causing long term damage to my spine and hip joints. Sometimes I have to spend more than half a day just sat on the toilet because my flow is so heavy it‚Äôs the only safe place to be. I get fevers and cold sweats. I can‚Äôt keep foods down. I get so weak and anaemic that I often pass out and vomit, sometimes even have fits. I get B12 injections every month for a weird form of anaemia and my period seems to reverse any benefit these have on my health. I‚Äôm type 1 diabetic and my period inexplicably causes dangerously low blood sugars. By all means I‚Äôm a good healthy weight, I eat well and exercise often but no amount of looking after myself seems to help. When I‚Äôm not on my period I‚Äôm fit as a fiddle. 

Recently I have had to leave my job at a cocktail bar (a job I really really loved as drink making is a funky little interest of mine) to go and work from home. My symptoms are so bad I can no longer leave my bed while menstruating and I couldn‚Äôt keep taking time off 

I just want my life back and am at the end of my tether. My body is telling me this is something really serious but I cannot get anyone to even listen let alone help. 

I have no idea what to do. This problem gets worse by the month and I‚Äôm actually starting to worry that I‚Äôm dying or something and it‚Äôs taking a huge toll on my mental health as well as my physical. I feel like I spend all my life terrified of getting my next period. 

How on gods green earth do I manage to make a doctor take me seriously!!??? 

TL;DR period symptoms are unbearable and ruining my life. Doctors won‚Äôt listen.

vxnf3o,WomensHealth,1657664739.0,"I had a ww exam appt today with a new-to-me gynecologist. I've never had good experiences with obgyns before but I went into the appointment hopeful I'd find someone right for me. In addition to the exam I wanted to talk to her about a different form of bc (I'm on a pill right now and I'm neither here nor there about it; I want to get an implant like nexplanon).

 So I ask her about getting one and she proceeds on this 20 minute rant about how awful they are and how terrible the side effects are and how much weight I'll gain (I'm already pretty big) and how much everyone she does them for hates it. I'm pretty set on it because my anxiety has me freaking out since roe fell and I'm afraid bc will be next. When I told her about my fears she said 'we in the industry don't think bc will be banned. They'll probably go after insurance companies and make it so they can't cover it and patients will have to pay out of pocket.' I was like ok so now you see why I'm anxious and would like to get something that will last me 3-5 years that I can afford right now. She told me I was overreacting but if I was so dead set on it she guessed she'd make an appt for me.

I was so mad leaving the appt that I cried all the way to work. I still am struggling. It feels like I've cried all day bc I'm so embarrassed about how she made me feel. I've done my research on it. I know the possible side effects and risks but right now all the benefits seem better to me. I know people have struggled with it but the good thing about it is you can take it out whenever so why not try it?

I guess I'm just confused and frustrated why this doctor tried so hard to talk me out of it. She didn't even give me any alternatives other than sticking with what I'm on now. She even questioned why I was even on bc if I'm not sexually active. Maybe I will be? Maybe I enjoy the security? Maybe I enjoy the regularity (tho I know an implant can mess with that).

Sorry for the long rant, I just feel stuck. All the women in my life keep telling me I'm overreacting and I need to get a grip. I do feel like I'm panicking but to me it feels warranted.

IBS diagnosis early on, a gluten allergy diagnosis 3 years ago and for a while an overall sense of malaise; sometimes worse, sometimes less with good lifestyle choices, and sometimes out of my control. My husband and I decided after 14 years together to try to conceive. My doctor made me wait a year to do any testing so I did my own with the Everly well test kit and it showed my hormones in abnormal ranges. My gyno was not pleasant about coming in with my own to ask questions saying I should have just waited. However, the point was: not getting pregnant is a symptom, I want to be healthy. I don't want to just treat this as a fertility issue when it's not just that. My hair has been falling out, weight gain, fatigue, depression; the overwhelming obvious symptoms to me. I've seen my primary and my gyno multiple times this year. Further testing with them and my primary say ""I'm just fine."" The gyno refers me to a fertility specialist even after I question their dates of the blood draw. ""Close enough"" doesn't matter when your cycle is irregular. 

A couple months ago I found and pay out of pocket for a holistic doctor that does a full work up. She listened. To EVERYTHING. This week I got a PCOS diagnosis. Something my doctor team should have put together. A year and a half into this fertility issue and now all my symptoms make sense and there is a path forward for managing symptoms and a baby if it's meant to be. 

The same thing happened to get my gluten allergy diagnosis. I was breaking out for months with horrible eczema and my doctor just kept changing the steroid cream. A visit to the holistic doctor and it was so obvious to them it was food related and the referred me to a GI for confirmation.

This month (9 months after I detected the second lump), I had a mammogram that came back as ""highly suspicious for malignancy."" I'm waiting on the biopsy results.

I am horrified. If I had never found the first lump, I wouldn't have put the second on the back burner. I just got off the phone with my doctor, and I am so mad at myself, afraid, disgusted, heartbroken. I'm only 32, I have no history in my family, and the last lump was benign. I should not have assumed I was safe. I'm a seasonal worker far away from my friends and family, and I only have insurance for 2 more months IF I keep working, which I'm not sure if I'll be able to depending on what this biopsy says.

So I haven‚Äôt gotten my vaccine yet for a few reasons. 1) I am an indigenous woman and although I trust science and logic, I, as well as my tribe, has not had good experiences with doctors and I am worried how marginalized communities will be affected by COVID and the vaccine. 2) (and the reason I am posting on this sub) The hormonal effects young women (I am 24) are facing. And finally 3) I have had a blood clot in the past and an issue with one of my ovaries, which ended up causing the blood clot.

I know someone who is in a sorority, so friends with a lot of young women my age, and her and her friends have all had some sort of hormonal problem. Period that lasts months, no period for months, breast sensitivity, PMS without being on their period, etc.

Have you had any of these issues with the vaccine? If so, what were they? How bad were they?

I want to be responsible and get the vaccine and this post is really just assurance and preparation for me. I want to know what I could be facing.

I just had a routine papsmear with the VA. The last time I saw my primary care provider she commented that I was due for a papsmear and asked I wanted to schedule one with her. I said yes and after the appointment the front desk scheduled me an appointment for three weeks later. 

I show up today and am sat down in the room when the doctor shows up and asks me why I'm there. I'm kinda confused, cause she is the one that wanted me to come in. I tell her that she scheduled for a pap. She got defensive and told me that she doesn't do any scheduling and rambled for a minute about how she didn't schedule me for this. 

She leaves and says her nurse will come in and get me ready. Her nurse comes in like the ground is on fire. She is rushing and knocking things over. She keeps slamming the door into the wall as she walks in and out of the room.

I've had three irregular periods in a row where all were really light and getting lighter. I had one that was even 10 days late. Add that to the hirsutism and I'm understandably worried.

I set up an appointment with my family doctor after the first two periods are odd and he does nothing about it and just says ""let's wait and see."" I'm annoyed but leave it be. He's the doctor, he would know right? 

Third period is even lighter and shorter than the previous two. My sister suspects PCOS so I go to a walk in clinic near where I live. I describe my issues and my suspicions. He sends me to get an ultrasound.

Ultrasound comes back fine aside from some small fat deposits on my liver apparently (I've already been taking steps to improve my health and eating habits so I'm not too worried about that right now). He says he can prescribe medication for the hirsutism if it bothers me that much but his tone says he's not planning on taking any further action. I clarify that I'm more concerned about the periods than I am about the hair growing on my face. He agrees to refer me to a gyn. Now I'm just waiting to hear back from that.

It's ridiculous. Why in the hell would a doctor think that facial hair is my priority? Did he just not write down anything else I said?

Add that to the family doctor I saw for 20 odd years and didn't tell me once that my cholesterol was getting high. I didn't find that out until my sister convinced me to see a different doctor since she had had significant problems with him as well. The new doctor took one look at my previous blood work and told me flat out that if it gets any higher, I'll need medication for it.

I used to have the constant need of farting. I discovered that apples were causing them. I used to eat daily 2 apples during that time, and maybe it was too much fiber for my body. Last year this problem appeared again but it wasn't very hard. However, this need has gotten worse again since two months ago. I stopped eating some biscuits that had a lot of fiber and caused me diarrhea and a lot of flatulence and my problems disappeared but now they have appeared again.   
This problem is even worse when I'm on my period, I have the constant need of farting and I live with the fear of being heard.  
Also, I don't know why but when I'm at home I don't have this urge of farting, but when I'm around people this need magically appears. So maybe anxiety is related to this. Another factor that seems to affect my urge to fart is whether I'm sitting or standing up. When I'm sitting I constantly need to fart, but when I'm walking I don't have this need.  
In conclusion, I don't know if this is caused by an aliment that my body doesn't like, by my hormones, by anxiety, or by my pose, but I NEED help I can't be happy this way I can't be with friends because of this problem and I am afraid that I isolate myself.

get there. not my usual place, and i had a bad feeling, but i didn't trust my gut because i've been so busy lately and wanted to get it over with. everything is fine, but they said they might need to do a transvaginal probe. i was like ""cool no one told me that but okay"" so when the tech asked, i said yes bc i obviously wanted to figure out what was wrong (she was concerned about ovarian cysts so i felt anxious already)

after i consented she showed me the probe, explained what it would be like and asked if i wanted to put it in or if she should. i said smth like ""whatever is easier i guess?"" because i am a human doormat with zero brain cells

she proceeds to go way too far down, MISS MY VAGINA and INSERTED IT INTO MY ASSHOLE. LIKE ALL THE WAY AND WENT ""here we go"" when it showed on the screen and i was like ""......i think that's my butt"" and she was like ""oops!"" took it out, and then dangled it right over my vagina (touching it already) and went ""put it in then"" and i was so shocked at this point from having my asshole penetrated all the way that i just moved it in

then i sat there almost dissociating as she went through my entire fucking body with that thing, and when i was done and she noticed i was crying she asked if i was okay and said ""oh...you could've told me :("" like to wash it or clean it offf YOU ARE THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL MA'AM.

i'm so sick of being in pain and crying. i genuinely can't stop thinking about yesterday and how disgusting i feel. i have contamination ocd so it's even worse than it would normally be, and i don't know what to do except feel numb. they did find that i have a follicular/physiological cyst in my right ovary, but according to dr. gaslight, it's nothing to worry about in terms of size or seriousness (my primary hasn't seen the results yet).

I'm a design research graduate student conducting research on gender bias in healthcare.

However, I still have a lot of research to do before I start designing a solution.

I received over 300 responses last time I posted a survey and was hoping y'all could come through for me again!

     Here is a little bit about myself so maybe someone can help me..
 I‚Äôm a 22YO who has been sexually active since I was 15 so not going into details about count or anything. For the most part i would say I have been safe about it. I got on BC about 4 years ago. The REAL problem began last year. I started with horrible vaginal smell I can‚Äôt describe it just smelt disgusting! I was away on vacation, but I got back and went to my doc right away. I got tested for STIs maybe about 3 times now. I‚Äôve been going back again and again now I just gave up. All my tests came back negative. I had a yeast infection and also had a UTI ( I get them oferten ). Got treated for all of that. It‚Äôs been over 6 months but I still get that nasty smelling discharge. I have good hygiene. Shower daily wear clean fresh undergarments ( clothes in general ) daily. I take vitamins so I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm healthy. I‚Äôm currently not active due to this issue which I don‚Äôt mind. 
  Usually my day starts with waking up and changing my underwear due to it having discharge that smells horrible. I feel so embarrassed I feel like other people can also smell it. I feel dirty even though I‚Äôm taking care of myself by being tested and doing my part in keeping up with my hygiene. All my tests have came back negative so idk why this is happening what is wrong with me?? I‚Äôm so ashamed maybe it‚Äôs my fault. Has anyone experienced something like this?

Figuring out how to make this sub a safe place for women is still a work-in-progress. Because this sub is so new with so few mods, I have set this sub to Restricted for the time being, so that only approved members can post and comment. This was in response to men making misogynistic comments in posts, chats, DMs, etc.   


Ultimately, however, I don't think that the entire sub will have to remain Restricted/approved-members-only. My goal is to recruit enough mods that we can make this sub public, and quickly intercept posts by men intending to derail our conversations. 

Concerning the structure of this sub, I propose the following flairs for posts: 

*Discussion*: All users can comment on these posts. This is meant for a broader discussion of women's issues, and could include disagreement. 

*Support*: These posts are not intended for debate, but instead are intended for women to vent and have a safe place to seek out support and reassurance. I would also like to do something here where posts tagged Support are only commented on by Approved Members to ensure a safe and supportive environment for women, much like how /r/BlackPeopleTwitter have Country Club posts. 

*Other*: For the posts that don't fall neatly into either category, OP should specify what type of response they hope to receive from the user base.

So after being told by my doctor I probably have another yeast infection, I was prescribed canestan cream and I have been using it on my vulva and clit because it's so itchy. Today I pulled up my clitoral hood and found some white stuff. I have some questions:
1. I thought its probably the cream, but does the cream getting to sensitive places like this cause itching? 

2. I dont know if I'm making it worse. Should I stop putting the cream on my clit? It's really itchy there.

3. I tried to remove it with a wet cotton pad and it's a sensitive painful area so I wasnt able to get all of it out. How do I remove it?

4. How do I know if its smegma or cream? How can you tell? 

5. If there is smegma under my clitoral hood is that what's causing the clitoral itching?

I'm nervous for her, because although I do not desire bio children myself, she has not had much good to say about the father of her child for the last couple of years due largely to him being adhd about finances and other important things and having anger issues, or her pregnancy for these last 8 months (it was premature). 

I last saw her a week before her water broke, and they hadn't even chosen a name yet, in part because they had totally different ideas about how a name should be chosen. Apparently when her labor started (unexpectedly) he was off camping 8 hours away, and she sent an email to 20 friends telling them what was going on. I immediately texted her and asked if she needed help with anything. Then like an hour later he emailed everyone and asked them to stop sending messages because they didn't need anything and it was too much for him to handle, but he'd be there as soon as he could. 

Anyway, as many people do these days, a couple days later her husband sent a little email announcement that the birth was finally complete. It included this line: ""I could not ask for a better mother to my son."" I guess the wording bothers me because he clearly put effort into it. Why does it not say ""our son""? (He then goes on to instruct people to contact my friends sister-in-law if they want to come by to offer food or help in other ways.)

rqold7,WomensHealth,1640722581.0,"I‚Äôm 27 and live in Canada. I started having terrible upper right back pain right under my shoulder and close to the spine about 6 weeks ago. It literally takes my breath away sometimes, unlike any pain I‚Äôve had before and I‚Äôve experienced quite a bit in that realm. Soon after, my calf and ankle swelled up and hip and pelvic pain/swelling developed too. 

I went to a clinic and they just looked at my leg, not even my back, and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just varicose veins‚Äù. I kept reiterating that my pain was severe in my back and other places, but she insisted it was just the veins. 

I went to the ER from that office straight away. Again, for some reason, they focused mainly on leg swelling and gave me an ultrasound. They diagnosed me with veinous thrombosis (the non threatening kind) and said NSAIDs would do the trick. Once again, I asked about the back and hip pain and he said they ‚Äúit COULD be causing it.‚Äù

I was exhausted after 8 hours in the ER. Went home and over the week, the pain got worse and worse. A deep throbbing pain that never ever goes away. And my pelvis was swollen. I called a telemedicine line and the nurse said it sounded kidney related and connected me to a doctor who, over the phone, decided I had a UTI (with very little symptoms other than pelvic pain) and prescribed me antibiotics for it.

I‚Äôve never had a UTI, so I didn‚Äôt really argue. I took the anti-biotics and didn‚Äôt get any better. Finally, my family doctor got in contact with me after weeks of messages.

I told her everything in detail. She ordered blood work and said that urinalysis would be pointless as I was finishing up antibiotics and about to start my period, but to follow up for the form at a later date. Unfortunately, I tried getting in contact with her for this over and over and still have not received urinalysis referral forms. 

I did the blood work on Christmas Eve and that day I find a huge lump in my breast in the same side as my back and hip pain. It‚Äôs under the arm pit, hard, and cannot be moved. I think I feel another and the lymph nodes on my breast, beneath my jaw on that side, on the back of my neck on that side, and in my pelvis are all slightly enlarged. 

Of course, my doctor is closed until the 3rd and I‚Äôm here worried and dealing with this pain, unsure what my next move should be or if I am going to be heard or taken seriously at all. I have no appetite and having food in my stomach hurts. I‚Äôve lost a bunch of weight and I didn‚Äôt really have much to lose in the first place. 

Whenever I mention my pain and concern, those around me keep telling me to ‚Äúadvocate for yourself more‚Äù. What constitutes advocating for one‚Äôs health? Should I be holding a radiologist hostage? Supergluing myself to a hospital triage desk? Am I missing some important secret detail when it comes to navigating Canadian health care that only I have somehow overlooked? Not to mention, I‚Äôm doing all of this so incredibly ill and every day my quality of life decreases little by little. And because most of the time no one actually sees me in person, they can‚Äôt even get the idea of how sick I have become. I can list out everything happening to me to every doctor and nurse I speak to, even my own, but to them they are just words. What do I have to do? Honestly? What is there to do? I‚Äôll try anything at this point.

UPDATE: I made an appointment with TeleMed to hopefully get a referral for a mammogram or urinalysis‚Ä¶ ANYTHING, really, as I can‚Äôt get an appointment with my doctor until the 10th and she doesn‚Äôt have in person availability until late February. I got this email today:

l95ptt,TwoXSupport,1612071563.0,"I broke up with my abusive ex in May 2019, no contact since August 2019. In addition to the severe emotional abuse, he never worked and put me in a horrible financial situation that was very traumatic to navigate after we broke up. It was absolutely horrible and humiliating trying to figure out the debt and a get out from under a house not worth the mortgage. 

The letter was pretty epic and seething with rage, but a controlled and focused rage. Not the shaky apologetic way I used to talk to him. Not screaming or constant swearing. I am a pretty decent writer, and I thought it was a mic drop of a letter. I felt strong and unafraid. 

After I pressed send I felt a huge weight be lifted, and I had more catharsis than I expected. Like I had taken the burdens he left me with, put them in that letter, and gave them to him to carry. I said if I have to deal with this, he has to at least know and live with the harm he caused. 

Cut to 2 days ago, and I get a notification that he had saved something to an old shared album I had forgotten about. Photos of our dog. It was a screenshot of him flirting with some woman. Not a graphic exchange, but mildly sexual and then there was a sexy cartoon. 

I was pissed because this is a very oddly timed ‚Äòaccidental‚Äô save, in an album untouched for 18 months. But then I was hit with what I now think was pity. The dog in the photos died, and for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt kick him off the album without making sure he had the photos, the thought made me very sad. 

I sent him the photos with what I admit was a nasty message: 

‚ÄúSending these to you in case you never downloaded them. Noticed you were still on my shared album this week after you ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô saved a screenshot of your lame flirting. Lucky gal, a lot of disappointing sex awaits her! üñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèº‚Äù

Since then I have felt guilty and mean and have been THIS close to reaching out to apologize. Then today, I hear he is being kicked out of his place, and now I am just WRACKED with guilt. I feel like a monster, and I am also feeling old familiar feelings of pitying him and wanting to ease his pain. Thoughts like ‚Äúmaybe I overreacted to what he did‚Äù ‚Äúhe never meant to hurt me‚Äù and other abused mind nonsense. I am shocked by how STRONG the pull of these thoughts are. Dominating my emotional brain, while my logical brain is like ‚Äúwhaaa? That‚Äôs fucked up.‚Äù 

I was angry and assertive af in the letter, but I don‚Äôt think it was unfair. My punches were to the gut, but not below the belt. Especially considering the amount of trauma he inflicted on me. But the text message was maybe too mean.

j1sffb,WomensHealth,1601353942.0,"I had my first Pap today, and as a 28F virgin, I just want to say thanks to anyone who has previously shared their own Pap experiences. I read a lot of posts and comments prior to going for my exam. It definitely helped to read about it all ahead of time because by the time I was in the office, I was too nervous to really take in much of what my doctor was saying. Here's a little about my first experience for anyone else who be doing as I did with reading about Pap smears on Reddit.

Long read ahead: 

I went to my PCP, not an OB-GYN. I was expecting a breast exam and thorough external and internal pelvic exam along with some history taking. What I got was pretty brief. 

First the questions/history. I'm not sexually active, so I guess that cut a lot of potential questions. But I was still surprised that doc didn't ask about the possibility of previous sexual experiences. It's none, but still I was surprised she didn't confirm. She asked if I had any breast tenderness or abnormalities. Asked if I was experiencing any vaginal discharge.

She asked if I'd had a Pap before, and upon answering 'no', she proceeded to explain what she was going to do and showed me the instruments she was going to be using. So glad she knew it was my first one. She ended up swapping the plastic speculum that her medical assistant had lain out for a smaller one. I was already familiar with the tools she had because of the research that I did here and on a few health/clinic websites. The brush bristles are really fine and soft!

She left the exam room to let me get undressed. They provided me with a paper sheet (a plenty big one, thank goodness) and a paper crop top that I was to wear with the opening in the front. They gave me plenty time to get ready and sit on the exam table.

Doc and the MA entered. I felt like my body was more nervous than my mind. Internally I felt fairly at ease. It was glad to feel safe.

First I lied back on the table, and the doc, wearing gloves, gently palpated each of my breasts. It was simple and over in a minute. She made no comment about feeling any lumps. Thank goodness because I've never been really confident in what I was feeling with my self breast exams.

Next the doc walked to the end of the exam table, folded part of the paper sheet up over my pelvis and pulled out the metal stirrups from the table. She sat down, had me out my feet up in the stirrups, and asked me to scoot down toward the end of the table. It happened quickly, so I was over the whole idea of her seeing everything down there pretty quick. I like how calm she seemed. Not a bit of awkwardness from her. No hesitation, but not rushed either. She got me to relax, take a few deep breaths, and to spread my knees.

If she did a external visual inspection, it was brief. I didn't feel her touch me but to spread my labia right before inserting the speculum. This part did cause me some discomfort. I briefly felt the coolness if the lubricated speculum before it entered my vagina. The first part of the insertion was smooth. I was relaxing and just focused on breathing slowly. Then I felt a sharp pain. I don't know if this was before or after she opened the speculum. I wondered if I should say something. I wondered if the speculum was pinching me. But I tried to stay calm and breathe instead. I figured this was the discomfort that she warned me about. The sharp nature surprised me, but it was tolerable for the short duration that the exam lasted. She did the couple swabs and handed each to the MA.

She then smoothly removed the speculum and told me that was it! I was relieved that she didn't perform a bimanual or rectal exam. I was prepared for it mentally, but was glad when it didn't happen. She warned me about the possibility of spotting, said I'd have the results in a few days, and then she and MA left to let me get dressed and leave. I got up, wiped myself with the paper sheet (thanks whoever mentioned doing this, because doc didn't suggest it, and I'm not sure if I'd have thought to do it in that moment) and headed out. I guess there weren't any visual abnormalities, because she didn't mention any findings. Now I just wait on the Pap results.

After all the research I did, I was prepared for a whole lot more. I felt empowered to learn so much and finally get my first Pap experience over with.

ii56ao,TwoXSupport,1598613208.0,"I'm in kinda an unusual situation. This is partly a rant but I'm mostly looking for support and advice.

I'm a woman in a relationship with a woman and we have been together for 8 years. In the last 12 months she had breast augmentation and facial feminization surgery, which has made her really happy and confident. I'm happy for her, I supported her emotionally through the surgeries, I took care of her before and after the surgeries, but it's triggered a load of weird emotional and body issues in me and just general anger at the world. It's provided evidence for the argument that looking good leads to happiness. It's reminded me that women have to somehow pay a price for acceptance and recognition in society. The narrow definition of what a woman ""should"" look like in order to be accepted in the world is so often sculpted by the male gaze - literally by the many male plastic surgeons, metaphorically by the images that appear around us in male-controlled media. Being a lesbian makes these issues worse because the only acceptable kind of lesbian in this world is ""two hot girls kissing"", which is hardly representative of my lived experience. Generally, being a lesbian is a strange experience in a heteronormative world because the world teaches women how to be attractive for the benefit of men, but when you don't want to attract men like...what do you do? How do I decide how to show up in the world?

Some days it's not an issue for me, but there are other times these feelings of inadequacy and imperfection suddenly pop into my mind and bring me down. Recognizing and accepting these negative emotions in a mindful way doesn't empower me, it makes me feel worthless and powerless. I frequently find myself comparing my features to her professionally sculpted features and seeing myself as never living up to her standard of beauty. She says things to me like, ""I had my dad's nose and it made me look masculine so I had to have a nose job, but your nose makes you look feminine"" even though I've said I don't like my nose because I have my dad's nose, but it just feels like I only have the option to be psychologically ok with how I look whilst she gets to fix her problems by paying loads of money for surgery. Spending time in plastic surgery clinics with her really didn't help my self esteem, it just reminded me that I could ""buy happiness"" if I wanted and could afford it, but even if I did the underlying causes of my sadness would not be fixed. Sometimes my partner will randomly complain about all the men who are oogling her new boobs and it sounds horrible but I struggle to have sympathy for her because she asked the surgeon to make her boobs big, like, she could have chosen smaller implants but she didn't, and she told me that she knew she would get extra attention for having big boobs before she got surgery. Also, before she got implants I used to really like my boobs, but since her BA I feel small and unshapely and just generally unfeminine. Another problem is that I struggle to find her boobs attractive post-surgery. I know that makes me the asshole, and this comes from feelings of jealousy and resentment, but it's not a consistent feeling. Some days it doesn't bother me, other days it bothers me a lot and it's usually linked to how good I feel about myself on that day. I understand where the feelings come from, but when will these feelings go away?

She talks to people about all the surgeries she's had and people praise her for being brave, true to herself and see her as some kind of super human, but I put in years of work and effort into reading about psychology, body issues, trying to improve myself and unlearn unhealthy coping mechanisms but nobody seems to recognize that as work, they just say something really meaningless like, ""Oh that must be hard for you"", which makes me feel dismissed. I know the issue is that I compare myself to her, and it's an unfair comparison, but the feelings are still there and I don't know what to do about it. I'm on antidepressants and been seeing a therapist for 1.5 years already, and I talk to my therapist about these issues. Ironically, I experience weight issues as a side effect of the antidepressants so I'm trying to get off them now. The pressure to be happy, to love yourself, to love the body you're in, to be body positive etc. is just too much some days and I'm tired of it and I'm tired of my brain making my life difficult. Is there a way to move past the anger and sadness?

ec3k49,WomensHealth,1576623444.0,"So today was my insertion day of my IUD at Planned Prenthood. 
1 week ago I called my local planned parenthood and scheduled an appointment for a consultation to get a hormonal IUD placed.

I had my consultation set up for the next day and I went and discussed my options with the nurse. We decided on the Liletta IUD.

 The reason I got the Liletta over the Mirena was because at my Planned Parenthood they use Liletta because it is a little bit cheaper than the Mirena because of the insertion device used. 

But it is the exact same as mirena same hormones same size IUD. 

So here is my experience today getting my Liletta IUD:
I took 800mg Ibuprofen about an hour before my appointment. 
I ate some mac and cheese so I had something in my stomach.
Headed over to my planned parenthood for my appointment. Checked in and was brought back right away. They checked my height, weight, vitals, and had me pee in a cup. 

After I went into a room and spoke with the nurse practitioner and she gave me consent forms to read and sign.
She then left and had me undress from the waist down and cover myself with a sheet and about 5 minutes later another nurse practitioner came in and prepped for the IUD insertion.

My stomach was hurting before I even got it because I was so nervous. 

When the nurse practitioner came in she asked if I had any questions and explained what she would be doing today during the procedure and asked me if I had any questions. 

She then had me get into position on the table and lie back and put my feet in the stirrups and placed a speculum into my vagina then placed her fingers in my vagina for a manual exam to check the positioning of my cervix. 

She then cleaned my cervix twice with betadine solution. It was cold.

After cleaning she explained that she was stabilizing my cervix with a tenaculum. It hurt like a sharp pinch but I was okay I just breathed through it.

She then measured my uterine depth with a uterine sound the tool and told me I measured a 7 (6 to 8cm is normal, I think you have to be at least a 6 to get an IUD) It felt like an extremely long and strong cramp.

Within a minute the intense pain from the tenaculum and the uterine sound had went away. 

She then lined up the IUD inserter to the correct position. 

When she went to insert the IUD, it felt like intense pressure to where I inhaled sharply and said ahhhhhh real loud twice üòÇ then the pressure and pain subsided and she said she was done. I was like wow it only lasted a few seconds. 

She then cut my strings and removed the tenaculum and speculum from my vagina. I already felt so much better when she did that. 

The nurse had said I had a huge blood clot as she was cleaning me up but she said it was nothing to worry about. 

She then had me put my feet down and sit back and relax for a few minutes on the table. 

She said I was a rockstar and did amazing lol 

The nurse practitioner then told me what to watch out for and she said to get myself a treat (I went and got a hot fudge sundae) 
She said I did a great job and gave me my paperwork and I checked out up front and left. Went and got some icecream and went home to chill out since.

It's now been about 4 hours and I feel fine just have cramps. Not too much bleeding but enough for a pad. All in all I feel great and I'm glad it's over. 

Getting an IUD is an experience but your doctors are professionals and they want you to have to most comfortable experience possible. 

I'm happy that for a few minutes of pain I now have several years of worry free birth control. And I would recommend an IUD to anyone who is scared of the procedure of getting one inserted. Go for it, I thought it was definelty worth it. 

I will update in a few weeks how I've adjusted to getting my IUD. Hope I helped someone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/ec3k49/my_experience_getting_a_liletta_iud_at_planned/,My experience getting a Liletta IUD at Planned Parenthood,,49,9,0.99,short-stuff13
bzd28q,WomensHealth,1560262708.0,"Across America, nearly 12 million women and girls aged 12 to 52 are living in poverty. This 40-year span is the average range of a U.S. female‚Äôs menstruation. If most of these females are struggling to afford food, how can they be expected to buy tampons?

Menstrual products are not SNAP eligible, meaning they are not covered by food stamps, yet they are one of the most requested items at homeless shelters. To put it in perspective: a 36-count box of tampons costs about $7. The average woman goes through approximately 240 tampons per year. That‚Äôs a set back of $48 annually and $1920 over her entire menstruation‚Äì even more if she has a heavier flow.

The American College of Obstetrics estimates two-thirds of low-income women don‚Äôt have enough money to buy menstrual products at least one time per year. It is also an impediment to education: a study by Always found that one in five girls have missed school due to a lack of period protection.

Financial status aside, we‚Äôre all getting penalized for having our periods. Products that count as a medical expense are exempt from sales tax, like band-aids, walkers, sunscreen‚Äì even Viagra gets a tax break in every state besides Illinois. Yet menstrual products are only currently tax-free in 15 states; five of those states don‚Äôt even have sales tax in general. Many period equity advocates have pressed on why tampons and sanitary napkins are taxed since menstruating is a biological function.

I'm a producer for Empowered Health, a podcast focused on navigating women's health, we just released an episode all about period poverty, menstrual equity, and the tampon tax.

We talk with Nadya Okamoto of PERIOD. The Menstrual Movement and Kate Sanetra-Butler of Dignity Matters, two leaders working to end period poverty, who break down why it should be a right to health for every woman to have access to menstrual products. Sanetra-Butler‚Äôs organization is on a mission to get menstrual products into all the schools, shelters, clinics, and whenever needed in Massachusetts, currently supporting over 2,500 women and girls every month. PERIOD. mobilizes college and high school students to advocate for period equity in over 400 chapters nationwide. Colorado Rep. Leslie Herod fills us in what it‚Äôs like to get your period in prison and the bill she sponsored to better those conditions.

Between teenagers missing class due to a lack of menstrual products, incarcerated females trading sex for a tampon, and 35 states of women taxed for their femininity, there is a real need to address how our country views menstruation. Figured this group might be interested in what they has to say surrounding the topic, links to listen:

Many women have the shared experience of painful pelvic exams due to the use of a speculum, but this shouldn‚Äôt be the case because there are multiple models and sizes of speculums. I was doing some research on this and in almost every article I came across the deciding factor when choosing a speculum size is sexual activity. The smaller speculums are used for those who have not had sex and the larger ones are for those who are sexually active. To me, this comes off as using the mindset of ‚Äúsex makes her loose‚Äù which is scientifically untrue.

nbqlgs,TwoXSupport,1620937783.0,"Update at the bottom

I‚Äôm (35F) looking for support and also some courage for what I am about to do. My narcissistic abusive father is in hospice and will be dying in the next few days. I have done my best to process my feelings, discussed it with my therapist and psychiatrist...and yet nothing prepares you for it to happen when it happens.

I have been NoContact with my nuclear family for 5 1/2 years. My father‚Äôs controlling rage ruled the house, and he took it out on my younger brother with autism. My father also sexually, verbally and emotionally abused me and my mother turned a blind eye. 

Now he‚Äôs dying and I‚Äôm going to go see him. I want to look in the face of my life‚Äôs villain, my rapist, my emotional tormentor. The person who ruined my chance to be a loved child. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm expecting to see. But I hope it feels like closure. He can never hurt me again. He can never touch me again. He can never stalk me, harass me, spread hateful lies about me ever again. 

But I‚Äôll undoubtedly see my mother. And I adamantly refuse to be her emotional support animal. She was there growing up. She knows what he did. She didn‚Äôt protect us from him. She was the physical abuser in the house. And she participated in the event that lead me to go NC. She chose her abusive husband over her children.

I‚Äôm telling myself I‚Äôm doing this for me. I want to do it for me. I have to do this for me. I want to choose the last memory I have with him. I want to feel empowered, strong, and dig up my courage. I want to be able to say to myself that I have power and purpose and will stand fully in my power. I am worthy of so much more than I‚Äôve been given. 

There will be no eulogy from me. There will be no mourning by me. And his funeral will be missing his most coveted ‚Äúpossession‚Äù- his daughter. Kesha‚Äôs Rainbow Album is pouring out of my soul right now. 

I refuse to explain myself to extended family, be guilt tripped into ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù (their word) and I am steadfast in my decision to do this on my terms. My life is as irrelevant to them as theirs is to mine. I will not let them take even a speck of me. 

And I can‚Äôt fucking wait to reunite with my brother. I escaped my parents 5 1/2 years ago. He could not. Soon we will both be free.

UPDATE (sorry it‚Äôs loooooong)

Thanks to anyone who read this and especially those who took the time to respond. I don‚Äôt know where to start other than... He‚Äôs dead. I‚Äôm not! 

I showed up at the house with my Aunt (my rock) at my side. I wore 4in knee high leather boots, falsies, styled my hair, and had black pointy finger nails. With that fierceness and my overall energy... no one recognized me besides my brother! Ahahaha especially not my mother. It felt empowering and also highly ridiculous. But I guess they‚Äôve never seen me stand fully in my power as a woman. 

The hospital bed was in the middle of the living room and he looked like a dying old man. A far cry from what he was before. In that moment I had to make a choice. My aunt shoed all the relatives out of the room and I stood and just looked at him. The monster was gone and all I saw was a suffering old man who wasted his life. I walked around him and placed his hand around mine and I felt him twitch/grip me for a second. I felt nothing emotionally, just blank. Feel free to psycho-analyze this in the comments! 

I spoke in his ear and said ‚Äúit‚Äôs me (name redacted), your daughter. Your family is all around you and you can let go now. Look into the light and descend into darkness (no idea where that line came from!). His breathing started to get a bit erratic so I called everyone back in. Within 30 mins he was deceased. Once I realized he wasn‚Äôt going to breathe anymore, I called my mom over to take his hand. 

I tried to keep my emotions in check for the sake of those around me who were actually grieving (mostly respect for my brother). But I went to my aunt, who has stepped back a bit and we held each other while I said aloud with enough volume to be heard by all ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over. It‚Äôs finally over. He can‚Äôt hurt me anymore!‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt facing anyone so I missed any reactions. They didn‚Äôt deserve to see my pain anyways. I cried tears of joy outside where no one could mistake them for grief. 

And that was it. It felt like I was in a fugue state, but fully in control. It helped that I had a day beforehand with my Aunt and Uncle to feel safe, and to just meditate all day to fully prepare. As cruel as it sounds, I felt some joy, but mostly instant and total relief. In that moment when he was truly gone, my shoulders dropped instantly. Like I had been carrying a weight all my life that was finally lifted. And the persistent nightmares about him have stopped. 

I know this is far too long already but I have to say thank you to everyone that supported me in my journey. I am grateful for all I have been given and this experience of final relief and closure. It has been almost a week now and I think this freedom is here to stay.

I found so much relief reading everyone‚Äôs responses from this group and wanted to tack on to it for other women that are going through something similar. 

The procedure itself wasn‚Äôt bad. Think of it this way, if you can get through the biopsy, you can absolutely get through this. This was 100 times easier. 

My doctor prescribed me with 2 .25mg Xanax to take before the procedure. One was to be taken 1 hour before the procedure and the other was to be taken when I arrived at the office. I‚Äôm not sure I really noticed the effects of this medication, but I can assume that it made me less anxious. 

There was a lot of equipment in the room, which made me very nervous and curious but the doctor did a great job of explaining everything and what it would be used for. There was a slightly bigger speculum for this procedure, so that was a little uncomfortable, but bare-able. 

The entire procedure took around 25 minutes. We did have to wait a few minutes after the lidocaine shots because I was shaking (apparently this is normal) so perhaps the entire PROCEDURE, minus the waiting, took around 20 minutes.

fcqsev,WomensHealth,1583218378.0,"This is an updated version of my last post. I finally found my peace and just want to help others out there.

In 2016, shortly after my partner cheated on me, I woke up one day after unprotected sex with him with a HORRIBLE itching and sore vagina. I was confused as this has never happened to me before in my life! I head to Planned Parenthood where they diagnose me with BV and thrush. I take fluconazole and flagyl. The thrush symptoms diminished but the BV STAYED.

I go through 2017 and 2018 with horrible BV symptoms. My symptoms included: thin gray discharge with a horrible smell, discomfort, bleeding between periods, itching, and painful sex. My sex life was a mess and my self confidence plummeted. I would go every 4-6 months or so back to Planned Parenthood just to be diagnosed with BV over and over again. I was diagnosed by them using a microscopic exam of my vaginal fluid which always presented clue cells and an elevated PH. During these two years I was clueless, I attributed the infection to lifestyle changes and blaming my body for not being able to maintain balance. The medical professionals at Planned Parenthood were not very helpful and throughout the 2 years I felt a lot of shame coming in for these recurring infections. During this time I found a lot of temporary relief by using boric acid suppositories for the discharge and smell (it made life bearable). 

In 2019 I got closer to m underlying issue. I went to a primary care doctor that did a BV test with a culture and a swab. The results showed that I was equivocal for BV (which basically means there was an overgrowth of gardnerella which is the BV associated bacteria, but also a good amount of my healthy bacteria) So what did this mean? At this time my symptoms changed to a malodorous GREEN discharge? All common STD tests came back negative. The same week I head back to Planned Parenthood to do yet another microscope exam, the exam showed many clue cells, elevated PH, and WHITE BLOOD CELLS. Bv does not typically cause white blood cells so they tried to suggest I have chlamydia.. however like I said the STD screen my primary care doctor did was negative. Planned Parenthood diagnosed me with BV. So within 2 days I have two different diagnoses from two health centers.

I read a lot about ureaplasma and mycoplasma infections. In short, BV is typically caused by a gardnerella bacteria overgrowth, but the presence of mycoplasma and ureaplasma can raise the ph causing the gardnerella overgrowth. So in other words, these strains are not typically tested for, but can cause an imbalance down there so will often times be disguised as a different type of infection like BV and thrush. Since many people do not have symptoms when infected, it makes sense to just treat the secondary infection, but if it becomes recurring you need to treat the underlying cause. Mycoplasma and ureaplasma will also cause white blood cells on the wet mount microscope exam. 

I presumtively treated myself with 1g of azithromycin, but I was still experiencing symptoms. I wasn't sure if it was yeast or treatment failure. So at the end of 2019 I go to a very mean OBGYN. He insists I am colonized with the bacterias and that treatment is pointless, but he oblidges and tests me anyways. I am diagnosed with Mycoplasma Hominis, Ureaplasma Urealiticum, and Ureaplasma Parvum... Now I know why I was having so many issues! I am prescribed 7 days of doxycycline which I am now seeing that it should have been at least 2 weeks worth. The OBGYN was obviously not well read on these infections as you can see in the notes he was about to prescribe me the incorrect antibiotic.

In the meantime I get partner treatment for 7 days of doxycycline and we abstain from unprotected sex for 3 weeks. I take two fluconazole pills because I was experiencing yeast infection symptoms after the round of doxy that I took. Four weeks after treatment I see a new OBGYN. He examines me and also sees a sample of my discharge under a microscope. He tells me it is the ""Cleanest wet mount he has seen in a while"" He saw very little clue cells and yeast. I am elated, but not completely convinced. 

I dish out $200 of my own money and order myself the Vaginal and STI Microgendx test online. This test differs from others because it breaks down all bacterial strains found in your vaginal sample so you can see what pathogens are there. The results also include an antibiotic recommendation to see if there is any resistance in the genes that you have. I do my swab and home and have my new doctor sign on the form so that the lab is able to release my results to me. I am using this as a test of cure. At this point I am having no symptoms, I am just getting used to my discharge changes through the cycle. Let's face it after 3 years, every change in my discharge freaks me out even though I know it is normal to have thick, thinner, milky, and watery discharge at different times. I am just getting used to it again.

I receive my results by email. The results did not show any mycoplasma or ureaplamsa present. The results do show MEDIUM gardnerella load, but also plenty of healthy lacobacillus present. My new OBGYN is on board with my thoughts that since I am not presenting symptoms, I am just going to leave the gardnerella untreated for now. As you can see on the results, the gardnerella would be successfully with flagyl as there is no resistance detected. I am relieved to see that I am still colonized with healthy bacteria. I thought my flora would be doomed forever and that I would never recover.

Thank you for reading about my experience. I just want to help others. No one deserves to feel dismissed about their health. The whole situation was extremely frustrating. If I were to do anything differently I would have skipped the whole mystery diagnosis and spent the $200 right away on the Microgendx test.

I expressed to him that women are always told to see a GP when experiencing the symptoms I am currently having and he laughed and said ‚Äòyou‚Äôre 27‚Äô.

He kept insisting the issue is with my bowels but I told him I‚Äôm not having any symptoms or issues that are bowel related.

When I asked for potentially a CT scan referral he laughed at me. He said he‚Äôd send a referral for a pelvic scan but seemed reluctant to do so and made comments that the hospital probably won‚Äôt want to do it.

I‚Äôve been having issues with my breathing and despite bringing this up twice it was ignored.
I recently had a urine test that revealed I have a fair amount of blood in my urine and this was not brought up or acknowledged.

I tried to show him how swollen my abdomen is and he didn‚Äôt look at all and just asked me to lay down so he could feel it.

I can‚Äôt imagine any of this behaviour was intentional to make me feel small but I came out of that appointment feeling upset and like I was trying to make a big deal out of nothing.

On my notes it says he advised me to come back if my symptoms worsen- this wasn‚Äôt said to me and had it have been said to me I would have replied that that is exactly why I am here. My symptoms are getting worse and I am starting to get distressed.‚Äù

1bljb55,WomensHealth,1711166975.0,"hi. im in 8th grade (13 yrs old) and i just got my first period.

The first time i got ‚Äústaining‚Äù or ‚Äúspots‚Äù was a month and a half ago. I told my mom crying and we discussed it and eventually decided, again, that it was staining and would come back in a few months as my real period. 

It‚Äôs been 1.5 months, and i went to the bathroom after school yesterday and when i wiped, it was brown/red. This is when i realized that it was infact my real period since it wasnt just brown spots anymore. I went to school today with a panty liner, and it was hell. Within the first hour (or less) of school it was already fully brown. I kept using the bathroom and putting more and more toilet paper. btw i was wearing leggings‚Ä¶ nothing leaked through (thank god üôèüôè) but it was so stressful.

I actually hate it so much. It smells, feels so uncomfortable, and I constantly feel like im peeing and discharging at the same time. The first time I thought i got it (when i cried to my mom) i couldnt stop crying. not even because i got my period, but i honestly have a fear of getting older and having to do things on my own and i guess this made me realize that im growing up and it really freaks me out. I dont want to grow up. Im only 13. 

should i wear a tampon? I have 3 older sisters but im too scared to tell them and my mom (why? idk.) i decided that tomorrow ill tell them but im afraid ill start balling my eyes out. Im supposed to be the younger, little, sister. Im not supposed to be able to relate to them. 

luckily, im very educated about periods and i have my older sisters to help me, and im really grateful for that.

This is all over the course of 5 or 6 years. I was off it for a few years, went back on it, on yet another brand, when I started dating someone. Once again, I did not like the way it made me feel or the side effects I experienced. So, I made the decision to get off it. My bf and I have been together for 3 years now, and are fine with using condoms. We understand the efficacy of them. We live together and are in our late 20s/30s so even if I were to get pregnant, it‚Äôs not something either of us would consider the end of the world.

I had to see my doctor today to get a refill on some other prescriptions, I have ADHD and anxiety. She was selecting the prescriptions to refill and asked me about my birth control and I told her I stopped taking it and was using condoms.

She then freaked out and started explaining to me my chances of getting pregnant and basically showed me what the stats are for each form of contraception. She has told me I am not a good candidate for an IUD in the past. I don‚Äôt want to be on the pill. I guess I could explore the arm thing or the shot, but again, I just feel fine with what I‚Äôm currently doing. She also asked if I knew about plan b and insinuated that me getting pregnant would be the end of the world. For the record, I have no idea what I would do if I got pregnant right now, but that‚Äôs beside the point. I‚Äôm confident I would figure out the best decision for me.

I am just annoyed that she is putting all this pressure on me to get back on the pill or a different method. I understand she‚Äôs trying to do her job, but honestly I feel like I am the one in control of my body and what I want to put into it.

pu6g3b,WomensHealth,1632436551.0,"Hi everyone. I'm 32 years old. I had a pap smear today at a new gynecologist. It took 2 months to get this referral. My last gyno I was with for half of my life, and his professionalism sets the bar really high. I knew going into this appointment not to expect that kind of quality of care, because military spouses usually don't get great healthcare in military towns because people move and leave so often it's like everyone is just a number on an insurance sheet. 
So back to the appointment... I didn't even see a real gynecologist, I saw a nurse practitioner. That is no knock against nurse practitioners. In my hometown for 15 years my primary care was a NP and I loved her. I prefer a NP as my primary care. But I asked for a referral to specifically see a gyno. I have a history of an abnormal pap, had to have a biopsy, and cryotherapy for pre cancerous cervical cells. I really was hoping for an honest to God real gyno. 

So she seemed nice when she walked in. She does the pap and when she's done she asked me a couple of questions to which I replied yes. She then said I have cervicitis. She VERY briefly explained what it was & said it was from STDs. She said she was prescribing an antibiotic. That's it. No plan for follow up care to make sure it went away. No plans for if it wasn't caused by what she said (which I doubt because I've been in a faithful marriage for 7 years) what the course of action would be. 

Thank God for glasses and face masks because they hide tears. She was waiting for me at the receptionist desk after I got dressed to tell me my insurance only approved one visit with the referral and if I wanted to come back I'd need to get another referral and with the referral it would have to specifically state what the visit was for! Talk about invasion of privacy and embarassing!!!! And it seemed like she enjoyed telling me this. My reply was oh no it'll take them over a month to do a referral and she was in a chipper mood and she said ""sorry!"" As she walked off behind the wall and that's the last I saw of her. 

I cried in my car for 10 minutes afterward. I've never been made to feel like that by a healthcare worker before. 

I'm most concerned about the cervicitis. She basically threw this antibiotic script at me and sent me on my way with no follow up care.

I had a doctor I trusted at university before I graduated, but had to move back in with my parents (in a different part of the state) and therefore can't see her anymore.  

This new doctor is a connection of my mothers, and I don't feel comfortable about it. They know each other because my mother did domestic work for one of her former patients, and we used to take her to her appointments. The thing is\~ I was roped in to doing domestic maid work before I would have been legally allowed to do so. 

My mother has always laughed me off when I was incredibly ill, never gave me heating packs for dealing with my period pain, and didn't seem to care at all when I was vomiting spontaneously from how bad my cramps are. The majority of my adolescence, I never got regular yearly checkups and when I was sick or there was something wrong with me, neither of my parents really took any care of me. I thought it was normal to be forced to go to school, or just lay in bed alone for hours with nothing but \*sometimes expired canned soup (once, literally thrown out of my mother's hand and at my torso from several feet away) tossed at the foot of my bed, and getting yelled at because my painful cough was ""my fault."" (to quote my mother when I was in middle school, exactly) 

All of a sudden, however, now that I've come back from college, she's become controlling about it. I use my mother's insurance because I just graduated and am still unemployed, but I know she pulled strings to get me to see this doctor specifically after I tried and failed to find a primary care doctor that would take me in, on my own. I've only had issues like this with my mother and her insurance, but when I was alone at college, using university insurance, there were far less issues. 

More than six months ago, I told my mother and my new doctor that my former (college) doctor told me to ask to get tested and potentially treated for endometriosis. Then, however, they both just brushed me off and didn't listen. The new doctor told me that testing for endometriosis didn't exist. Now, after I've spent the last several months in visibly excruciating pain(which had been ongoing for the past several years), my mother finally told me that she would tell my doctor that she (my mother) could introduce me to a ob/gyn to get it checked. 

But why does my mother keep getting involved? She vacillates between negligence and narcissism, and always has, but I didn't think it was much of a problem before my health and mental well-being were put in jeopardy. My mother wouldn't allow me to see a psychiatrist even though my father is diagnosed with schizophrenia. Growing up, she always used to tell me that she didn't even ""believe in depression."" But now, when I become angry or blow up about something (PMS) when I'm in excruciating pain that my family pretends doesn't exist, she accuses me of paranoia and all of a sudden tries to claim that I have my fathers schizophrenia, using it against me. 

I don't know what to do. My main issue with this doctor is that seeing her gives my mother control over my healthcare, and I don't feel safe or comfortable with that. Another is the fact that I don't feel like I can safely mention something (like the potential rape) that is controversial, traumatic, and has the potential to effect the rest of my overall health. 

I'm sorry\~ I'm young and I'm scared, and I'm a woman who's been hurt a lot by professionals I'm supposed to listen to without question, and I don't know how to navigate a system of healthcare that seems to be rigged against me *and* a controlling mother who keeps interfering.

bgbees,WomensHealth,1555989686.0,"Hey all! I‚Äôm a producer for Empowered Health, a new podcast that is aiming to demystify women‚Äôs health.

We just put out the first episode of our two-part series on the maternal mortality crisis. Maternal mortality and morbidity are especially tragic because most of the deaths and traumatic near misses were and are preventable. Episode one explores how race plays a role in this crisis‚Äì it becomes clear our culture isn't doing enough to protect black mothers. Black women are three to four times more likely than non-Hispanic white women to die during childbirth. That‚Äôs even after adjusting for socioeconomic factors, like education and income.

As more than one researcher said to us, the birthing crisis is the canary in the coal mine of women's health. It is a problem of women not being listened to, not being respected and being disempowered during a time in life when they should feel entitled to good care and a personal feeling of empowerment, feeling full of feminine power and purpose. We can regenerate our species! There is no greater super power. Yet, women are mad to feel scared, isolated and passive during this profound experience.

Dr. Neel Shah, the director of the Delivery Decisions Initiative at Ariadne Labs, breaks down how medical students are trained to be biased and how that contributes to this problem. Fatima Dainkeh of YWCABoston helps us understand actually talking to black mothers is a good place to start and that a day-long workshop on bias isn't going to cut it. Midwife Ebony Marcelle shares how she's shaped her care model to better serve African American mothers. And, Dr. Mary-Ann Etiebet, the executive director of Merck for Mothers, looks at the global initiative she heads working to integrating the voices of black women into maternal mortality and morbidity.

Well I‚Äôve been talking to a guy since October of last year. We had sex that same month and then we had sex again in December of 2022.

Went to my gyno back in March of this year and found out that I have HR HPV with no malignancy. Gyno told me to come back next year in February for a follow up with my status.

Since being diagnosed was celibate for eight months but last night I broke the celibacy streak and now I‚Äôm worried.

I told the guy that I have HPV and that the ball is in his court if he wants to move forward with sex.

Mind you I got vaccinated when I was a little girl but clearly that didn‚Äôt do much since there are so many strains.

We both said we would just do oral. Like me giving him head and him sucking on my boobs but our plan went out the window and we had vaginal sex.

He doesn‚Äôt seem too worried about it but I am. I don‚Äôt have warts but I hope he doesn‚Äôt develop them. Also hope I don‚Äôt get any other stains of HPV. He said that he hasn‚Äôt had sex since the last time we did it. 

I feel like poison ivory in a way. 

I have no idea where I got HPV from. It might have been him or another partner.

14zsks5,WomensHealth,1689369720.0,"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm Maddie from The Wall Street Journal. We have a story out today that explores whether menopause is an essential part of aging. I hope you find it interesting!

From Sumathi Reddy:

>Imagine if women never reached menopause, that dreaded middle-age milestone‚Äîor could delay it, or decide when to have it.  
>  
>Women could remain fertile longer and would have more choice about when to start a family. They wouldn‚Äôt struggle with symptoms like hot flashes, mood swings and brain fog in the prime of their careers and family lives.  
>  
>Even more significantly, women might live longer and healthier lives. Though menopause‚Äîa full year without a menstrual cycle‚Äîis associated with the end of fertility, it also marks another profound but less recognized change. When the ovaries stop functioning and releasing important hormones, biological aging in women speeds up, increasing the risk of numerous health problems.  
>  
>‚ÄúMenopause is the single biggest accelerant of the diseases of aging for women across the board, whether it‚Äôs heart disease and stroke, autoimmune disorders, osteoporosis or cognitive decline,‚Äù says Piraye Yurttas Beim, founder and CEO of a biotech startup called Celmatix focused on improving ovarian health. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the end of the function of a key organ in our body, and we should not normalize it any more than we would normalize tooth decay, osteoarthritis or cognitive decline.‚Äù  
>  
>Beim is part of a small but growing group of scientists‚Äîmost, but not all, women‚Äîchallenging the idea that menopause is an essential part of aging. They point to research showing that women who go through menopause later in life have reduced health risks and live longer compared with those who go through it at younger ages. Research also shows that women have fewer chronic diseases compared with men‚Äîuntil the women hit middle age and menopause.  
>  
>‚ÄúWe are so ingrained in thinking that menopause is inevitable. That it‚Äôs just sort of something that has to happen,‚Äù says Dr. Zev Williams, an associate professor of women‚Äôs health and fertility expert at Columbia University who is leading an ovarian aging study. Yousin Suh, a professor of reproductive sciences at Columbia, says her own experience with menopausal symptoms such as brain fog and sleep issues helped motivate her to work with Williams on the study. ‚ÄúI was stimulated by my own misery,‚Äù she says.

wmz5vm,WomensHealth,1660346668.0,"TW:// while the trauma I discuss isn't really sexual in nature, the events can have some sexual implications... Hard to explain but yeah, if sexual abuse is triggering to you, I'd just not read this to stay on the safe side. 




I am a 20 years old woman today, and for as long as I've remembered, I've been very sensitive in my lower back and backside area. I could not explain why, but whenever friends or family accidentally or not touched me there, or even brushed against me, my body would recoil and move away, and it'd feel terrible. One time my aunt which whom I'm super close jokingly tapped my butt and I turned at her and yelled ""NO! NO!"" ... I didn't really get it, since I had no trauma that would cause such instinctive and strong reactions.


But then, I suddenly remembered one memory. It wasn't a suppressed memory but I also never thought of it as trauma. For me, it was just a normal random memory from a day in my 6th year of life.



I had to get a vaccine and so my parents took me to a clinic. We entered the tiny room in which three men if I remember well were standing there, probably nurses I assume.

I was told I needed to lower my pants to get a shot on my buttock. I suddenly felt shy and very uncomfortable. In front of 3 people, 3 men, I didn't want to lower my pants and underwear. I took the arm shot like a champ and didn't mind the needle one bit but no one told me I'd have to show my butt. 

So I showed discomfort as I could, by resisting and refusing to lower my pants. I didn't know how to explain my worry or discomfort as the adults started talking and interpreting my hesitation as fear of the needle. I wanted to tell them that I just didn't want to be seen half naked but no words came out.

Before I realized it, adult men were holding me down with their strong arm. I started crying as one of them lowered my pants and then my underwear. I didn't give a crap about the damn needle! I just- everything was happening so quick, and they were so strong, I couldn't even move a finger. I didn't want them to see me. I didn't want them to touch me.

Then the needle went in. It didn't hurt or anything. To be honest, I have 0 memory of what happened after that. I don't remember how I was dressed back up, if I cried or not, if I was happy on the way home or no, if I proudly talked about having received the shot.. Nothing. I have a complete blank after that.


It might seem like nothing special, and surely those men were just desensitized of seeing crying children who are scared of the needle all day. I know none of them probably saw that as more than a random day at work. I know even my parents, both doctors who were standing there looking at me just thought they had to endure looking at me cry because it was for my own good.

But today I realize how it affected me.

Being held down, being powerless, and having your intimacy completely disregarded. A 6 years old is most likely not aware of their sexuality, but at the same time they deserve to respected and not feel violated. I felt violated. It was terrifying.


So yeah, that's the story of my small trauma. It doesn't affect me day to day, to my knowledge (but again, I was never in an intimate relationship with anyone so I don't know if I'll have problems with thay) but I still wish it didn't happen that way.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/wmz5vm/i_was_6_i_felt_violated/,I was 6.

I attended an English-speaking highschool, completed AP English Lit, studied in the UK and the US (incl. publications) and now I read, watch and write English daily. All in all, I have a pretty decent grasp of the English language in several of its forms - informal/casual ways of speaking, business talk and academic discourse. I even got placed in the 99th percentile when I took the GMAT.

Nowadays, I live and work in my home country. Again and again, there are times when people around me translate things into English in ways that just don‚Äôt work, in moments when it really matters (e.g. slogans for worldwide marketing campaigns that they translate literally and that do not make sense at all in English - which is then confirmed by our ad agencies abroad, who ask whether they can change the slogan of the global campaign to make it understandable in English).

When I spot these kind of mistakes, I try to point them out politely, and again, only when it matters. I‚Äôm not going around correcting people when they‚Äôre just talking or writing an e-mail, but if there is a glaring mistranslation on the CEO‚Äôs global presentation you bet I say something.

The issue is that not everyone around me knows my history with English, and so often they don‚Äôt believe me and won‚Äôt listen to me, which can be really frustrating. In those moments, I just want to yell at them ‚ÄúI know what the fuck I‚Äôm talking about!!!‚Äù but I obviously can‚Äôt in a professional setting.

jzqkzc,WomensHealth,1606165815.0,"It feels like my hair has been thinning since puberty, and it's reaching a noticeable level at this point (I'm 19 and went through puberty between 11-13). I'm not like bald or anything, but my scalp is more noticeable in my part and I feel like my hairline isn't as strong anymore nor is there any volume. I've gotten bangs to try to cover up the lack of hairline and they're doing a pretty good job. To make things worse my hair is dark brown and I am quite pale, so this makes the contrast even worse. I've gone from having to only do 2 loops with a regular hair tie to 3 when putting up all of my hair in a ponytail (before getting the bangs). I use argan oil shampoo and conditioner and I don't think that causes hair loss, and I always rinse with cold water. I never dye my hair or use curling/straightening irons, blow dryers, or extra products. 

Maybe it's from increasing stress as I'm transitioning into an adult, maybe a vitamin deficiency or something. I don't think it's hormonal since I had a testosterone panel done and my levels were in the normal range, but I think something is wrong with my reproductive organs since I'm always in pain and have *really* bad periods but I haven't had an ultrasound yet to see if I'm right. 

I've started using Minoxidil a couple weeks ago, like the topical stuff advertised to men but it's also fine for women, but it takes a while for it to be noticeable. I have definitely lost less hair in the shower since starting though, and I'm noticing some new baby hairs along my (lack of) hairline. It sucks that the results go away a couple months after you stop taking it, which I will eventually have to do if I want children. 

I read a study saying women with hair loss who took omegas 3 and 6 along with antioxidants every day saw significant improvement after a year or so, so I'm taking those on top of my daily prenatal vitamin (that I take in place of a multivitamin since it has more good stuff in it, I'm not trying to get pregnant lmao). I know I won't really be able to measure progress from these because of the Minoxidil, but I'll do anything if it might help.

jsoqnh,WomensHealth,1605157762.0,"Hey y‚Äôall!

So I (19F) had a persistent bout of BV between January all the way up until September. My symptoms were fishy odor and my discharge wasn‚Äôt normal like how I was use to it being. The odor wasn‚Äôt prevalent enough to travel, but if I put my finger down there and did a sniff test, it was there. I tried many different home remedies like tea tree oil and coconut oil infused tampons, yeast infection treatments, etc. Nothing seemed to work. 

I also tried the NutraBlast Boric Acid Suppositories. After using them for 7 days, they would clear up the fishy odor for about a week. But then, the smell would come back. So it was only a good temporary fix. 

After being fed up and losing hope, in September I decided to visit a gynecologist. She prescribed me the Metronidazole vaginal cream, where I had to insert an applicator full of it for 7 days, once a day. This gel caused big clumps of white, coagulated discharge to come out of my vagina. But other than that, there were no other side effects. I think this aided in initially breaking down the biofilm of bacteria in my vagina which made the next things I did more effective. 

Along with the gel, here are the things that I attribute to clearing up my BV. 

1) Chobani Plain Nonfat Greek Yogurt and Activia Vanilla Daily Probiotic Yogurt Drink. I ate one cup and drank one bottle a day. Both have about 7 different live cultures in them that support gut health, which in turn supports vaginal health. I really hate yogurt, so I would add granola and dried cranberries for taste. 

2) The Irwin‚Äôs Naturals Healthy Tract Prebiotic ($17.99) and Fortify Optima Women‚Äôs Probiotic w/ 50 Billion live cultures for Vaginal and Urinary Health ($21.00). Both bought from Walmart. I have taken probiotics alone before and they either worked for some time but made the BV come back or didn‚Äôt really work for me at all. But, I did some research and saw that taking a prebiotic with a probiotic creates a symbiotic. The prebiotic is essentially food for the probiotic so it makes it stronger and more effective. Also, keeping both these pills in the refrigerator ensures that the live cultures die slower. So they will stay effective for even longer. I took one of each every day. 

I stayed consistent with the yogurt and prebiotic/probiotic for about a month but I saw results in two weeks. After I get out the shower, I‚Äôve basically made it a habit to do a sniff test. The fishy smell was completely gone and has remain gone to this day. My normal discharge and scent is back. I am so happy that I finally found something that gave me results. Honestly, I think these things cured my BV all together because sometimes I go about week or two without taking the pills and doing the yogurt (honestly out of laziness or it just slips my mind) and the fishy odor doesn‚Äôt return. 

Also, I wash my vulva with Dove‚Äôs Unscented Soap. This isn‚Äôt a necessary step and may not suit everyone. It‚Äôs the only soap that works for me and doesn‚Äôt upset my girl lol. I know gynecologists say to use just water but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable doing that. This soap works for me! 

As far as dieting habits, I tried to eliminate as much sugar from diet as possible. I only drank water and unsweetened cranberry juice. But I‚Äôm going to be honest, it was very hard sticking to this and I would still eat and drink sugary things from time to time. But my results weren‚Äôt affected. 

So yeah! I hope this helps someone else out there who may be suffering. Hard times don‚Äôt last forever. Doing research and being consistent is key!

cpiz0h,WomensHealth,1565645577.0,"Dear People with septate hymen,
        When I figured out I had a septate hymen I looked to Reddit for advice and it was not very helpful. I am here to tell you about my experience. 
        I didn‚Äôt know mine was different for a long time. I thought it was normal that my tampons would get stuck sometimes. I was lucky because I could still use tampons with mine. Eventually I did some googling about it and the internet told me I was abnormal and I had to go under anesthesia and get it removed. This scared me a lot but I told my mom and after way too many months I got a checkup. I went to my gyno and HE told me that it would break when I had sex. I trusted that for quite awhile before googling again and learning that I should absolutely not do that. So I went to a different gyno and SHE told me that we could just remove it then and there. She numbed me up and put a few stitches in and snip snip. The only pain I felt was when the numbing wore off but when I got home I took Tylenol and felt great. 
           Another issue I had was that on the internet they told me it would take months to heal and I was trying to have sex for the first time ASAP. We had been waiting for it to get dealt with but we were very worried about my healing time being MONTHS. My gyno told me that I couldn‚Äôt put a tampon in for 3 days and that in less than a week the stitches would fall out and I would be completely healed. 
           So for everyone worried about waiting months for it to heal and those who would rather just get it over with during sex because then it would be over with. DO NOT. It‚Äôs not worth it.  I honestly am so happy I did it and sex is not a problem at all.  It was easy and painless. 
           Don‚Äôt think that you are weird because you have it! It‚Äôs a common issue. Just because your hymen is a little weird doesn‚Äôt make u gross or less anything.

wpea0h,WomensHealth,1660605861.0,"Hi. I am a 33 year old female. Have two kids and breastfed both. weaned a year ago if that matters.

So long story short, I noticed a painful lump in my breast on Friday.(near nipple about the size of a lima bean)  Saturday the pain was worsening so I went to the dr who performed an ultrasound. the ultrasound didn't show anything conclusive, so he referred me to a breast center.

Today the breast center performed another ultrasound and a mammogram. The drs were very reassuring, saying they think it is a fibroadenoma, but still recommended to have a biopsy done this week (not so reassuring after all).

They went over the imaging with me, saying that there weren't typical signs of cancer but that they can't rule it out without biopsy so here we are.

I guess I am looking for advice from anyone who has gone through this before. What is the biopsy like? I am already sore in that spot so is it going to hurt like crazy? Has anyone ever had fibroadenoma - or had to have it biopsied. ugg the wait to the appointment and the wait after for results is going to drive me crazy. 

I also just had covid three weeks ago and feel like I am still crawling out of that hole. I have two little kids - I need to be well for them . please tell me that this is going to be ok.

Update for anyone else in the future/wondering : I had the biopsy and it wasn‚Äôt so bad. I cried on the table an embarrassing amount because I‚Äôm so freaked out about the situation, but the procedure itself was fine.

I know I need to lose weight and that it would help but I'm honestly at loss here, I make sure to take more proteins, especially after I workout. But I'm struggling so much, I seem to just fail, and it always gets worse. 

I feel like the doctors won't take me seriously, since they haven't before, and so I figured I should ask to other ladies for some advice... I would be very grateful. 

I'm sorry for bothering. I rarely reach out for help to anyone, but I figured I should for this.

g1w5y5,WomensHealth,1586970747.0,"I‚Äôve known all kinds of women. Naturally very thin women, those who lose weight/gain muscle easily, those who struggle every single day just to maintain their weight, and those who simply cannot lose weight no matter what. 

I fall into the latter two categories. I eat healthily, and pretty strictly only allow myself to sustain a very low carb diet; pasta and bread only occasionally and in very small portions. I‚Äôm relatively active. And yet, it is almost impossible for me to lose weight. I‚Äôm 25. The only time in my life I was able to lose and stay thin, I had to go to unhealthy extremes to maintain it (eating less than 800 calories a day). It was terrible. If I slipped up for a week and ate more/unhealthy food, I would immediately gain. Eventually, stress and full time job took over and I‚Äôve gained everything I originally lost back (and then some). I‚Äôve worked so hard and restricted myself from so many things and have nothing to show for it. 

I‚Äôve had bloodwork done, and according to the doctor, ‚Äúall levels are low‚Äù, meaning thyroid, iron, and several others, are in the ‚Äúlow functioning‚Äù range. The doctor decided they weren‚Äôt ‚Äúlow enough‚Äù to put me on any type of medication and instead tried to put me on an anti inflammatory diet (I tried it for weeks and felt no differently). After pestering her, she finally agreed to prescribe me a VERY low dosage of thyroid meds but they made no difference. It took over two months to even get that medication. 

I‚Äôm just so frustrated constantly. I don‚Äôt understand why my body is so resistant to my efforts to improve it. It‚Äôs been this way my entire life, since I was a little girl.

Not every month, but when I do get them, it‚Äôs always a few days before my period starts. The first time it happened, the pain was so crippling, so blindingly intense, that I thought I would pass out. The pain is located mostly in my lower abdomen, but will sometimes be accompanied by shooting pains all the way to my rectum, and it lasts anywhere between one and six hours.

A heating pad over my abdomen, along with peppermint tea, seems to help a little, but nothing I‚Äôve tried (stretches, walking, deep breathing, drawing my knees up to my chest) makes it go away completely. I basically have no choice but to lie there and wait for it to subside.

All the medical articles I read about this procedure said it would be ""uncomfortable"" and I might experience ""mild cramping"". My god was that an under statement.

My doctor is also a woman so I feel like she could have prepared me a bit more for the experience, I wasn't offered any pain meds or before or after. To make it worse she didn't collect enough tissue the first time around and had to go in for another sample.

I don't feel like I have an especially low pain tolerance. I have my tongue split and that wasn't as bad as this horror show. At least I knew what to expect and was warned that it was going to fucking hurt.

she then took me in for a pap smear and a few other tests which she told me she‚Äôd be testing for other things but never told me what. 

i went into a seperate room with 2 nurses and this doctor where they gave me no privacy to get unchanged, i had to take my pants off in front of them all and walk over to the bed. the doctor asked for cotton balls and she knew at the current time i was bleeding. the nurses had put half of the container of cotton balls on the tray for her to use. she grabbed a cotton ball with her clamps and put them extremely far up my vagina, to the point where i had told her i was in pain and yet she did it for the second time. once she was finished with the actual pap smear she made a joke to the nurses saying gosh thanks for all the cotton balls, and everyone laughed. the nurses had clearly gotten a lot of them out just to be sarcastic as at first they said they didn‚Äôt want to do a pap smear on me bleeding.

ug96ll,WomensHealth,1651438530.0,"Basically a vent post, fair warning.

I'm at the end of month 3, start of month 4 with a hormonal IUD. I've had dysmenorrhea since my teens. Combination tri-phasic pill helped for a few years then slowly wore off. I dealt for a few more years before I went to an OB/GYN to see if I could find out the WHY behind my debilitating pain. I told them right off the bat I didn't want to go straight to hormonal bc methods. I had suspected in the past that it exacerbated multiple issues of mine that had been better the last few years. The response was basically that they couldn't think of anything else to try except hormonal bc. Frustrated, but willing to try anything I stupidly agreed.

Continuous combination pill saw me bleeding every day for 4 months (nearly 5). They agreed bad choice and offered progesterone-only methods- either nexplanon (with the caveat that it's most noted side effect is spotting), or hormonal IUD. I didn't like the idea of it, but again, willing to try. I picked the IUD as bleeding every day was seriously messing with both my physical and mental health. 

Going into month 4 and my issues from years ago have come back the last couple weeks. I feel like I can't go to family, who dealt with me the first time around and all tapped out. I go to my partner to an extent but I'm starting to feel bad for doing so and trying not to anymore. So shouting into the void of the internet is my next best choice. 

I still have no idea what causes my dysmenorrhea. For the first time in years I'm extremely depressed and once again fighting self-harm urges and suicidal ideation. My lower extremeity joints are in pain after work with no way to stop it. I exercise daily, drink more water, and am eating healthier since last year and yet I'm back to gaining weight (and not in a good way). It's mind-numbingly frustrating that I expressed my fears of this and was still steam-rolled. If the healthcare field could stop slapping bandaids on my sunburn and actually determine a CAUSE and the SOLUTION to said cause that would be fantastic. Holy fuck I'm sick of feeling crazy.

l0l83z,WomensHealth,1611067642.0,"Hi all,

This is kinda a vent / rant but also ask for advice and experiences tbh so i dont feel so alone. 

The last 2 years i have had issues with my health. 2 years ago i got my first bladder infection at 19, i got it treated at the doctors with antibiotics etc.

This really was the catalyst for my issues, i started getting them monthly. I followed all the advice, during sex and not during sex. I then started getting bladder pain that would go away after an evening, doctor didnt think they were UTI's but maybe inflammation? I had an ultrasound, bladder all fine, also got my ovaries ultrasound and doctor said it looked like pcos. 

I have only had one uti in the past year now, but it just doesnt feel right. I dont feel like sex feels like it did, plus the amount of anxiety i got from sex after that really put pressure on my relationship. My boyfriend felt undesired, i felt pressured and shit about myself. I felt like the lighthearted enjoyment out of sex had been taken away and replaced with anxiety. My sex drive plummeted. 

Moving on to november 2019, i started to get extremely irritated down there so i assumed it was thrush which i had before. I did standard treatment as advised, didnt go away, cue like 4 months of basically not being able to do anything remotely sexual and if i did it flared up again. Went to the doctor.. Again..sent off some tests for anything it could be and came back with thrush.. Again. 

I am careful with things, only wash with water or an emolient based soap max once a day, change clothes and underwear after exercising, wash clothes with unscented non-bio wash and no fabric conditioner, dont wear underwear at night and only cotton underwear, etc etc etc

But i am STILL having issues. Going to the doctor is quite difficult right now because im not allowed to go back to university where i am registered due to covid. The doctors where i am at home are useless, its impossible to get an appointment. 

I feel completely stuck. I went on the progesterone only pill a few months back and recently came off as it killed my already low sex drive completely and I bled everyday.

I am only 21, i feel so upset about it. Its disrupted my body image, impacted my relationship to the point im thankful of quarantine as i dont have to worry about dissapointing my partner who has quite a high sex drive. I have almost broken up with him a couple times.

Im not really looking for medical advice per say, I am going to contact my doctor again and see what she says.

Im just looking for if anyone can relate, it feels like my choice and control about sex and my body have been stripped away from me. I dont really know how to navigate things from here.

jy1gkb,WomensHealth,1605920204.0,"Content warning - it's gross.

I have had PCOS since I was a teenager. I am currently 30.

For the past 4 months during my period I have been bleeding blood clots the size of my palm and going through a pad every hour or two and before they put me on birth control, it lasted 11 days. PP thought it was vaginosis. They put me on Flagyl and birth control. Didn't help. Next month, the ER doctor thought it was the birth control, even though I told her it happened before I was on the pill. She kept saying that the pills I'm on cause clotting. Finally, I go to an OB/GYN. She does blood tests and tells me I have PCOS, so my periods are going to be abnormal. She doesn't want to do much else, but I ask for an ultrasound to see. So the ultrasound gets done at a hospital and gets sent to her. First, she takes two weeks to look at it. Second, before I got the results of the ultrasound, a nurse called back with blood test results. They tested me for diabetes, thyroid issues, etc. Your typical ""she's fat, do the fat people tests."" Nurse says my blood tests are all normal and the only thing wrong with me is high cholesterol. High cholesterol doesn't cause clotting. 3 weeks after ultrasound was done, I finally get a nurse to tell me what the ultrasound said, since my OB/GYN isn't answering my calls. Said my lining was 22mm thick and that it was ""unremarkable."" I know on average the lining is around 11mm, and obviously thinner right after a period which was when I had my ultrasound. I asked the nurse how it's unremarkable that my lining is twice as thick as normal. She said, ""It just is.""

So I'm frustrated. I don't feel like the doctors are taking me seriously. I don't think bleeding clots the size of my palm is ""unremarkable."" And the OB/GYN doesn't seem to want to do anything to resolve this. I don't want to bleed like this until menopause. I don't know what to do or how to be taken seriously about this.

Has anyone else had this happen or know what it might be? I'm of the opinion that it might be an infection, based on what research I can do online, but, you know, WebMD isn't a doctor.

\- Clots the size of palm  
\- Clots are mostly red, but have some whitish material in them  
\- Heavy bleeding  
\- Uterine lining twice as thick as normal  
\- No fibroids (according to ultrasound)

Edit to add more information:

I've asked my friend group, and they recommended a different doctor to me. But unfortunately that doctor can't see me until February. On one hand, I think it's probably a good sign they are booked out that far because it means she's popular and everyone wants to see her. On the other hand, idk if I can wait 3 months, so I'm stuck.

BV is really a problem with the intestines and can affect the vagina causing BV aka Normal floral is off. 

Change diet. Avoid yeast, breads, sweets, red meat. You can also do a colon cleanse if you so desperately want too but my gynecologist didn‚Äôt really want me take drastic measures. 

She said she didn‚Äôt want to discourage oral sex but if possible to try to wash after because that brings bacteria. Also, to avoid baths because that also breeds bacteria. 

Don‚Äôt use tampons because tampons allow the bacteria to cling onto the cotton. Also, which shocked me is to not use the brand pads from ‚Äòalways‚Äô because there‚Äôs perfumes and the plastic irritates the floral in the vagina. 

She strongly advised in investing in a Diva cup because the material used doesn‚Äôt let bacteria cling and to also get cotton linen pads.

She also said since it was my fourth time with BV that boric acid was okay. Use twice a week. 

Also to  incorporate probiotics to keep intestinal and vaginal flora in check. 

Please also find a gynecologist who listens to you!! I searched for a new gynecologist because the first one did not hear me.

j2h0v8,WomensHealth,1601447786.0,"Hi, everyone. So, I am that girl who was originally worried that her ovary was dead, which led to a slippery slope all the way through major surgery, and then stage 3 ovarian cancer. So...I went to my chemotherapy counseling appointment, and it looks like we have the next step figured out. First off, it seems that there were a couple of things I misheard at my last appointment...though honestly, this new information sounds a bit better to me than what I originally believed.

Thankfully, I was wrong; they aren't starting the infusions in my chest, but in my arms. I still hate needles, but I can grit and bear that. However, if my veins get too brittle, a port in my chest may be necessary. I really, really hope it does not come to that...

We also spoke about frequency; turns out I had three options, not two; I originally believed that I could do regular weekly infusions, or perhaps a trial where my infusions would be every 3 weeks in larger doses with an extra dose of immunotherapy. However, there is a third option in the middle; I can get it every 3 weeks in larger doses, but with no immunotherapy. No matter the choice, I would be looking at 6 months.

For now, the doctors and I have decided that the third option would be best. The time in between would be easier on me, even if I would be looking at potentially more downtime between doses. Their studies also show a higher success rate with the younger patients taking this treatment, so me being in my 20s with no preexisting conditions before this will be immensely helpful. The surgery also helps my odds immensely, as it significantly reduced the number of cancer cells. Finally, the fewer doses may do better to preserve my veins and help them remain usable to the end of the treatment. I...am really hopeful of that. I start treatment in a week. Depending on how my genetic testing goes (they are apparently testing both my blood and the larger cyst that they took), they may decide to change treatment plans to include immunotherapy if they find a rare mutation.

As for my hair...I unfortunately can't expect to save it, as nowhere around here can make me a custom, real-hair wig...however, I...I have some ideas to keep some of it in some way, shape, or form...I have one friend who is amazing at cutting hair, and another at braiding. There is also a boutique an hour or so away from here that is apparently well-known around medical centers, as two separate ones have already recommended it to me. The owner is a cancer survivor herself, and she likes to provide wigs to cancer patients free of charge. She said that she wants to see me on Thursday, and she wants to see if she can get me a wig that is close enough to my true hair, or that fits...well, me. I have a friend who knows someone certified in microblading...so I am considering that, despite my fear of needles (it is either that or eyebrowless, because I know I would be awful at drawing eyebrows.

As for the side effects I was worried about, the docs explained that one as well; apparently the symptoms listed on the paperwork that they gave me, the ones that said to contact a doctor and seek medical help, were actually signs of these side effects. So as long as I contact the doctors immediately, they can treat me immediately.

This...its all happening so fast. It is really setting in...I am going to be fighting for my life here. That is downright terrifying...F*ck...

Erm...on the bright side, my abdomen seems to be healing...I am still pretty stiff and sore, but I have no problem getting up and moving around. I can even cough again without being in agony; I was trying to hold them in for the past couple of weeks! I can tell my diaphragm is happy to let it out. My spleen is no longer hurting. I still have aches and pains in my pelvic region, but none of them are as bad, and it is to be expected. I was pretty terrified when a sensitive lump appeared next to my bellybutton, but the doctor looked at it and said that it seems to be healing scar tissue, and I shouldn't worry. The only thing that truly sucks is the muscles in my lower back; they hurt like hell now, and lying on my back isn't helping, no matter what I do. I am tempted to start trying my side, because I haven't slept properly in days...maybe the small army of pillows and blankets I have stockpiled over time can help. People have told me that stockpiling these isn't ""mature"". Whelp, it was a good idea after all. F*ck maturity, I need sleep.

So...yeah. That is everything going on with...this. I will say it again for good measure; if you feel a weird pain in your pelvic/abdominal region that just won't stop, get your ass to the doctor as soon as possible.

I was in 11th grade and just got out of my first relationship, so I tried tinder. I talked to this one boy for a while. He was very sweet, or at least pretended to be. I had SATs and he texted me throughout with words of encouragement, even though I wouldn‚Äôt see them until after. He talked about how excited he was for me to meet his family. After talking for about a month, we set up a first date. I explained to him I was a virgin and planned to keep it that way fairly early on, and he told me how he respected me for that and it made him like me more. Date night comes.

We get in the theatre and are the only people in there besides an old couple way in the front. Almost immediately he starts kissing me. A bit fast for me, but I figure it fine. Then he started grabbing my chest. I was in shock so I just let it happen. Then he starts touching my crotch. I don‚Äôt know what to do and I really liked this guy, so I just laugh uncomfortably and push his hand away instead of getting mad. He puts his hand back and I do the same thing. After this happened twice more, he stopped for a bit. Then he took my hand and put it on his crotch. I again laugh uncomfortably and pull my hand away. He tried this one more time before stopping. We kiss a bit more and then he finally just lays his head on my lap and watches the movie. I feel disgusting. I want to call my mom and leave, but then I‚Äôd have to explain what happened and I was so worried she‚Äôd be mad, because I was mad at myself. Naturally the guy ghosted me after that, which really hurt me because I had allowed something to happen that I said I wouldn‚Äôt on the first date and he STILL decided I wasn‚Äôt worth it. I was so ashamed because while I did push him away, I could‚Äôve done more. I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúno‚Äù. I could‚Äôve just hid in the bathroom. But no, I just stayed there and took it. I felt so small.

Friday she comes home from school and quickly goes to her room--which is normal--comes out a bit later carrying an assortment of laundry and heads to the laundry room. 

Getting this girl to do laundry is seriously a major life event so very suspicious she is doing this without any fuss. I didn't want to say anything bc at her age I know everything is embarrassing and its easy to turn something simple into a major ordeal. After she starts the laundry and goes back into her room I admit I stopped it and I did snoop. 

Mixed in with random things to wash was a freshly soiled pair of underwear and the jeans she had on earlier.

So this Saturday we were chilling out and talking and I gently brought up the soiled panties. After deniles, then accusations I was snooping in her private matters, then trying to play it off as period stains, some not talking and some crying she said she had to go really badly and hates doing that (poo) in public bathrooms.  I tried to give her some facts that short of licking the toilet seat she can't get anything and toilet seats are probably cleaner than doorknobs she shut down pretty much but said she hates doing a poo anywhere but home and it's not a big deal and to leave her alone.

I further tried to ask if it was just the school bathrooms because I remember having a special hate for my school's bathrooms as well when I was younger so I can relate. She said the school bathrooms were pretty clean and the same as most other public bathrooms but she and most girls don't poo at school or in public bathrooms. So that is where is was left. 

She went out with some girlfriends sat night and Sunday had a fundraiser for her cheer squad. Today (monday) I again find a pair of soiled panties. 

Also mind you these are not like a very light skidmark kind of deal but these are pretty heavily soiled. 

My daughter is a great student, on the cheer squad, seems popular and and no health issues I am aware of. 

She is like most teens fashion, style and makeup obsessed and she always has good hygiene and grooming and spends far too much time with those sorts of things like every teen girl.

Afaik this is a recent thing.

Any thoughts? Suggestions? Just ignore it and see if it goes away?

She is out of school for the winter break and we have a very busy holiday season planned should I just see if it keeps happening?

yx6y4v,TwoXSupport,1668634430.0,"My ex-boyfriend who was long distance and I broke up around 4 months ago and the reason was because he became extremely controlling due to his own insecurities and fears and started restricting my life in different ways.  At first I tried to accommodate to his fears and gave up on all the things he didn't like: I stopped posting pictures on social media, erased my old pictures (the ones he disliked), stopped going to celebrations where there could be men. But it wasn't enough, then he started micromanaging my clothes and wanting me to give up on the gym. Apart from that, he would continuously distrust me and accuse me of cheating even if I never gave him any reason to distrust me. I always updated him throughout the day with pictures and he would start having bad gut feelings about me if one day I just forgot to update him with pictures throughout the day. Even if I was a little bit busy one day and he felt I wasn't being as loving or attentive he would spiral and accuse me. Sex was also an issue. We used to video call every day and I would usually change clothes in front of him (street clothes to house clothes) and he would get angry and say I shouldn't change clothes in front of him if I didn't aim to engage sexually with him because it was disrespectful to him. 

So the thing is I left him because I realized how terrible my mental health was and I was going to work literally crying everyday and having arguments in public with him on the phone. This wasn't our first breakup, he broke up with me three times a year ago because I wasn't Christian enough according to him. Although after this last breakup he started dating a girl who is not even Christian, only a week after our breakup. Our relationship lasted around 2 years. 

Well, the thing is that he blames me for leaving him and wanted me to apologize for it. He said I considered myself too good to endure his trauma. When I try to explain to him that the way that he was treating me was wrong he still doesn't see why I left him. He doesn't want to acknowledge how abusive and damaging his behaviour was towards me. Probably after a week he found a new girl and started dating her and in a month he was calling her his girlfriend. When I brought up the fact of him moving on too quickly and told him I felt hurt by that, because I was still open to fix our relationship even after our breakup, he started saying that I was the one to blame for the fact he started dating this girl so quickly, since I was the one leaving. He rubbed that girl in my face saying she was more loving and respectful than I was and that he didn't have to control her. That she would adapt to his needs and willingly sacrifice things to make him feel less worried. Then he tried to restore the relationship with me, but without wanting to leave this new girl. So I just cut off communication. 

It hurt like hell. I started wondering whether I was being too entitled for expecting him to solve our relationship. When he left me, I chased him and tried to restore our relationship. He even praised me for my perseverance when he left me. 

I wanted to ask here because men may have another perspective than women. What do you think?

I met him on tinder, went on a date, had fun, I saw his tinder was deleted shortly after, we went on 4 more dates where I never saw his home. Then he confesses he has a wife and a kid and they all live together and he felt bad that he didn't tell me before. I ended it right then and there, he continued to send me messages for almost a year afterwards, and I was genuinely scared of his obsession so I moved to a new address that he didn't know.

My whole life I‚Äôve only felt like I was convenient for people. I love to give and help, I get a lot of satisfaction out of it. I like to bake things, get gifts for people, cheer them up or help them with their life. 

But at the same time, it also makes me feel empty as I think about how rarely people will go out of their way for me. I felt as though my parents only cared about me as long as I maintained the household, or was a successful student. 

My friends only care insofar as I organize and facilitate events, but even that has died off during this time - before ~this~, if I went to visit them I could usually get them to agree but rarely would they come to me. I understand and accept that phases of life come and go, and it might be time for this group to dissolve naturally. I‚Äôve had acquaintances at workplaces but can never get things to the next step. 

My partner is aro, and discovered that 6 years into our relationship which consisted of sex, my maintaining the household and asking them to contribute, and a lot of confused feelings on both sides. (that being said, we have supported each other through a lot, but their lack of romantic feelings makes me question if I‚Äôm lovable). I‚Äôve only had a few romantic relationships and all of them I initiated and put the most work into maintaining. 

I‚Äôve always said and known that I‚Äôm not an easy person to like, I can be abrasive and sarcastic, but I also care really deeply about the people in my life. How do I find people who care equally deeply about me, without being too clingy or needy? I also don‚Äôt want to think of things too analytically or transactionally, as I do like to fall back on logic but I don‚Äôt feel like relationships should be that way.

My daughter is 10, the perfect age where hormones have been brewing but they're really ramping up lately. So she still needs me but treats my opinions/advice like it's nothing. Or doesn't listen at all. On top of needing to be told every day, multiple times a day, what chores are expected from her. Despite years of trying charts, alarms, rewards, punishments, and a variety of parenting techniques learned from self help guides she's still needing to be told to brush her teeth or throw away her trash. Just a constant struggle. I'm a single parent. I signed up for this. But, if we're being honest I never wanted to be a parent and I'm still bitter about feeling forced into parenting to begin with. I love her, I can't imagine my life without her, but I just can't get over how I've been missing feeling a real connection with her.

My dog's reactive, has separation anxiety, and is high energy. It's my fault for not knowing how to raise him from a pup properly and I hired a trainer to help us. That's $500 in training and extra supplies I couldn't afford but needed to spend because he was only getting worse and I didn't want to drop him at a shelter to get euthanized because I'm an idiot with dogs, apparently. Now he needs an hour walk in the morning, set feeding schedules, daily training multiple times a day, on top of the usual attention and play times and potty walks. And, of course, my daughter can't be bothered to help unless told.

I started a new job. It's a new center opening so I won't even know what it's like until mid to late October. It seems like a good fit but I'm already worried about not performing well. It's less pay. I was going to supplement with plasma donation (it's a plasma center so it's not out of my way or a big additional investment) to more than make up the difference but, and this is the biggest but of the story so far, I might have cancer.

I got a routine pap when getting an iud placed a couple of weeks ago and Tuesday I get a call from the center. ""You've had an abnormal pap, they found some lesions, and are HPV positive so we're going to send you something in the mail to get a colcoscopy scheduled to check for cancer cells"" is basically what she said. So now I get to wait for that letter to arrive, so I can hopefully schedule a colcoscopy before my current insurance runs out in the 60 day waiting period at my new job before the new insurance kicks in, and hear that I may or may not have cancer.

i'm just now learning about trauma bonds and everything related to abusive relationships. I never thought it was relevant to me before. I'll just tell the story as factual as I can but i don't want to be super specific either, just in case. We are only 2 years apart in age, him older.

We meet and it's the story I have now read to be trauma bonding. We click, he agrees with me on everything, he is perfect on paper. He puts in effort. He treats me very very well. He instantly love bombs me? Texts good morning and all day. Long paragraphs. Always uplifting me. I am told I am perfect and amazing. About 1 month in he says he will marry me. I am young. I swoon. I trust him. I tell him all my secrets as not to mess up our relationship in the name of being open and honest (mistake, right?).

After 2 or so weeks of dating we are making out. He presses into me very hard and it's uncomfortable and I say it hurts. He stops pressing so firmly into me. He is dry humping me. I tell him maybe 3 times it hurts. He keeps apologizing and then it hurts again. I let it go.

Around this time he is in his underwear. He wants me to feel his dick. I tell him I am not ready to see it and I close my eyes. He says okay, I won't take it out. I open my eyes and it is out. He laughs and puts it back in.

Shortly after, he wants to do oral. I say I am not ready yet. ( not a virgin but taking the relationship seriously) He kisses me everywhere. He goes lower and lower. I tell him not yet not today. He says ""Don't you trust me?"" He moves my shorts to the side and only licks around but not directly. I tell him okay but no further. He says please let me. I let him. He brings me to orgasm and instantly takes off his pants and underwear, lays down on the bed. I touches himself and asks if I will do him now so I give him oral and no grief.

3 weeks in we have sex. I tell him I'm not ready. I say I want to take it slowly and we have already rushed a lot. I want to savor this. He says, ""please fuck me"" over and over while kissing me and humping against me so hard it hurts. I say I have my period and I dont want that to be our first time. He says he doesn't mind. I say I have a tampon in. He says I can take it out. This ""please"" and ""no"" goes on until i say not yes but ""okay"". He removes my tampon and we have short sex.

We become an official couple. In between these moments is treating me to dates, texting me a lot, and planning the future. He wants me to meet his family.

The sex we have before he proposes (surprise proposal and I accept) is rough. But never that bad. sometimes it's perfect.

He never wants to be apart from me and we begin to spend all of our free time together. I cancel plans with friends for him (my mistake).

We spend every.single.night together no exceptions.

After less than 5 months, we are engaged. I am so happy but also I'm not? I ignore that and focus on how amazingly he treats me when he isn't upsetting me.

He starts picking fights with me over my thoughts and opinions. The arguments end when I PROMISE him I actually do agree with him and has a good point.

He tells me I can't be friends with my close male friend at all anymore. Not even if he is with us. He says, well actually you can be friends but then I will need therapy. I feel cruel to do that to him and I let go of a good friendship.

He assaults me for the first time in a way that I am able to finally acknowledge to myself is not okay. We have rough sex when he suddenly shoves his dick in my ass. I stop him quickly. He apologizes, cleans himself, then comes back to finish. I let it go until later. I ask him why. He says he drank too much. But this isn't a theme, he isn't a big drinker, he did not drink that much. It isn't an excuse anyway. He says he is sorry, he thought that I would think it is hot. He apologizes enough that I take it.

This ends up happening again around the same time but honestly I cannot recall the details. And the above might've even been the second time. All I can say is that I remember being upset that it happened twice.

It stops being only him causing fights and arguments. Now I am doing it too. I don't understand what is happening to us. He tells me we are in love and everything will be okay. That I have family trauma (true, but also the first time I have ever known it, he told me that I experienced childhood trauma from my stories) and he will be there for me and we will work through my issues.

We get married.

He starts calling me names as a joke and isn't apologetic until I am clearly upset.

Odd fights continue. My picking fights continue. Most are me yelling at him after he somehow, in some way, that I cannot articulate makes me feel like I am crazy to ask him to see my side, to give me the respect I thought he would. (gaslighting?)

We have a baby but I will skip through this for multiple reasons.

A lot of fights and red flags are thrown. Sexually and otherwise.

1 year later, Covid hits. He is WFH. He never leaves. He tells me how unwell I am. How toxic my family is. I end up wanting to die one day in an episode of total loss of control. I get myself into extensive therapy.

I think I am doing okay in my mind. I am doing all the tasks of mother and doing my best as wife. He tells me he wishes I was mentally well. I tell him I'm doing well. He tells me that I clearly am not.

He always puts a finger in or on my ass when I tell him over and over through the years that I do not like that. He ""forgets"". I beg him over and over to respect me (my mistake) and he acts remorseful but then fails to change.

This goes on until.

He throws the Abuse word at me. I am verbally abusive. I am easily irritable. I am quick to anger. I understand this vague but I am not denying this is true. I never tell him he is wrong.

I can never talk to him about how he makes me feel. He says he forgot when he doesn't change. He says work is stressful. He says being a dad is hard and I am too.

Lastly, He says he wants a divorce and he moves out.

He says he tried but I have too many problems and I am too abusive. He says he has to walk on eggshells and he can no longer do it.

I know I never nagged him because I was careful and mindful not to. I can't see the eggshells being anything other than me beginning to demand the respect I deserve the moment disrespect happens. But maybe I am wrong? Maybe I played a bigger part than I will admit to myself? Maybe he gaslit me into oblivion?

When we met i was working 2 jobs and going to school full-time getting straight A's. I was in extra curriculars and very social and outgoing.

I am none of these things now. I graduated but never held a job. He told me all along he wanted to build my esteem...But I had that? What happened? Am I crazy? Is he? Is it both of us ?

He convinced me that I needed him and he would never leave me but now I'm wondering what he ever really gave me?

kxj49v,TwoXSupport,1610671596.0,"Hi XXers. I (27F) am a few weeks away from my 7th anniversary with my spouse, K (31M).

We've dealt with a lot of stress and trauma in seven years, including (but not limited to): I was sexually abused by my dad and a babysitter's boyfriend and then assaulted and date raped several times in high school and college. My pregnancies were stressful, high-risk, and unplanned (one mini-pill failure, one Mirena failure). Both of our kids have congenital birth defects and spent time in the NICU and needed surgery. One of our kids was abused by a family member and we were cut off from the family when we reported it and got him sentenced to prison. I developed postpartum psychosis after our last pregnancy and ended up suicidal. He's an essential worker and had to live somewhere else from March to September this year because our kids are so high risk.

We were both raised conservative christian and didn't have sex before we were married (this is not how we are raising our kids). We didn't actually abstain for moral reasons but because I literally had a panic attack every time he touched my breasts, let alone trying anything else. The first  year of marriage was spent with me thinking it was my job to have sex with him every night (thanks again, fundie bullshit) and him not wanting to have sex because it was so clearly traumatizing for me. If we did have sex I had a panic attack and ended up crying in the shower. If we didn't have sex I thought I wasn't attractive to him and ended up crying in the shower.

Lots of individual and couples therapy later...

We had pretty much given up on penetrative sex in 2017 or 2018 as it was still painful and triggering, but were regularly (once or twice a week) having oral sex or getting each other off in other ways. I thought we had a sex life that was mutually satisfying and I enjoyed the time we spent together. It came up in a conversation that he didn't feel like we had a sex life at all. I was blindsided, and he explained that he only feels like we had sex if it involves him finishing inside me. I was, to put it mildly, shocked and horrified that we'd been living with such different perceptions of our intimacy. I offered to try penetrative sex again and, with some trial and error, we were able to find some ways that I didn't find triggering or painful. I also really enjoy getting him off, so even though I don't \*enjoy\* penetration on it's own I still enjoy the experience of being with him.

I feel like I have halfway killed myself trying to have sex with this man. I've been through so much therapy, I've constantly pushed my limits to try and please him, and I've put myself through a lot of pain and stress to accommodate his needs. Seven years later, I don't know what else to do for him. I do not remember a single time that he has initiated sex. Once I decided not to initiate until he did and caved after 6 weeks of no interest. The only times that he has seemed interested in sex with me is times when I literally cannot have it, like right after childbirth or while I was on bedrest. We were both too stressed out about another pregnancy to have sex after our youngest came home from the hospital, but he's had a vasectomy and I've had an ablation since then, so that's not a problem any more.

Cognitively I understand that him having a lower libido is fine and not my fault. And I also understand that we have \*so\* many extenuating circumstances right now: family, money, mental health, we're both on anti-depressants, he works a lot, history of sex ending poorly, etc... But I swear I'm horny all the time and it doesn't seem like working on this part of our relationship is even remotely a priority for him. At this point it's not even being turned down that hurts me as much as it is not feeling attractive and desirable. I don't want him to have sex with me out of pity or obligation, I just want him to want me occasionally. I don't know what to do. I love this man, we've fought through a bunch of shit and built a really great life together, he's a fantastic partner and dad and our kids are amazing. I don't want to spend my life with anyone else, but I also don't want to spend my life feeling worthless. Is anyone else dealing with a similar situation? How do I talk to him about this \*again\* without hurting his feelings?

I‚Äôve been seeing someone for a little over a month now. He‚Äôs super sweet and respectful and everything points to him being a good guy. 

But I question EVERYTHING. 
He doesn‚Äôt respond much one day, he‚Äôs losing interest. He isn‚Äôt as flirty as normal, he doesn‚Äôt want me. He doesn‚Äôt see me as much this week, he‚Äôs trying to end it. 

How do I get out of my head and just enjoy my time with him? I‚Äôve been hurt so many times I‚Äôm terrified. Anyone have advice?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/i7tgae/dating_is_so_hard/,Dating is so hard,Support - Advice Welcome,38,17,0.91,bbwhales2

p009l9,TwoXSupport,1628366494.0,"It's been a pretty bad time as the title says. In my country we are living one crisis after the other.
We still have problems with covid, mostly because most people don't want to vaccinate. 
We are living in a society where the casual sexism is the normal way to behave and we just had another femicide-the 7th one we had in the last year only. It's like every few weeks we are losing another woman who wanted to divorce her S.O and the term femicide is not official in my country so the news are always telling about a bad moment and a passionate love who had a tragic end.
But the last days nothing makes sense. We have many wild fires burning different places at the same time and no one is doing anything. We had a massive fire tragedy before three years, who ended with 102 deaths in less than an hour since it started. Everything happened so fast that the evacuation was almost out of question, everything went terribly wrong and the society is still mourning for the losses we had. Our current government used that tragedy to win the national elections, and the promised that they would be able to evacuate the place within 20 minutes and that everyone would be alive.
So now, I suppose that they are terrified that someone is gonna die again so they decided that they are gonna save everyone's life but they will no do anything else. They evacuate every single place that it's close to the fires, people are forced out of their houses, and yes thankfully we don't have human victims but... But the disaster is enormous! We are losing all that forest, hundreds of animals are dead, thousands of people are losing their houses and everything they own. We have places that the fire is burning for 5 whole days, without stop. The people are terrified, it's truly devestating to hear their agony screams as they are begging for help that no one is sending. The fire department is supposedly trying to put out the fires, other countries are sending their  firemen to aid our own, but they people who are in the fires are saying that no one is send to them. I don't understand why and I am so afraid for them. And my heart is sinking every time I am seeing a picture from the fires.
Everything seems pretty pointless with all that. I mean, personally I am safe  and generally I am quite happy but right now I feel emotional drained. I can't do anything except watching terrified the news and feeling extremely hopeless. I studied sociology, I am very involved with the social movements and I hate that I can't do anything to help except of offering some money and first aid items. I am watching all that people becoming homeless in a single moment, losing everything in a country that already is in a big economy crisis for more than a decade so literally they will have nothing no and I just... I can't believe it. It feels that we are living one nightmare right after the other.

ippv1p,TwoXSupport,1599687731.0,"This is going to be a long one I think, sorry :S

I talked recently, in a comment on another post here, about how I‚Äôm waiting to find out if my sexual assault case will be accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service.

Well, today I got my answer. The police called me and told me that the CPS had decided not to pursue charges. Then they came over to see me to discuss why and to give me a letter from the prosecutor which went into more detail on how the decision was made and why etc. They basically said it came down to an issue of consent, that there was no CCTV and no other witnesses to the actual incident, and there was no way to prove that I had actually said no.

After the police left I just broke. I don‚Äôt mean broke down crying, although there was plenty of that. I mean, I just lay on the sofa with tears rolling down my face. I had no energy left, for anything. All I could think was that it was pointless, that it had all been for nothing. It felt very similar to the night it happened, after I‚Äôd got home. That night, I went to the shower and just sat in the bath under the stream of water and stared at the plug hole after using up every bottle of soap and shampoo that I could get my hands on and still not feeling clean. I think I was sat there, just staring, for about an hour, would‚Äôve stayed there longer if I hadn‚Äôt heard my daughter walking up the stairs. I felt like that again today. Powerless, useless, weak, disgusting, it was all my fault.

It‚Äôs been 19 months since I reported him. 19 months of people telling me to stay strong, positive and hopeful, that I would get justice and he would be punished. I know those people meant well and I don‚Äôt blame them at all, they care about me and want to see me happy. However from the start, the police told me that there was a very low chance of prosecution.

I couldn‚Äôt read the letter. My daughter read it, just in case there was anything that I needed to know right now, but I just couldn‚Äôt face it. The self-blame was already back just from the few details that the police told me, I knew that it would be worse if I read that letter. Hours later, my daughter went to get food and I decided to read through it myself. I felt like I may as well get it over with.

I am so SO angry.

Half of the reasons why they rejected the case are the same reasons why it took me 5 weeks to report, as I felt nobody would believe me, that it was my own fault, that if I‚Äôd done things differently and not trusted certain people then it wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Those reasons just further validated the self-blame and made me wish I hadn‚Äôt reported.

The other reasons given are things that I apparently ‚Äúagreed in my video statement happened consensually‚Äù, or ‚Äúadmitted to doing‚Äù or things that are just missing from the report entirely.

I absolutely DID NOT do these things that they say I agreed to doing consensually. I absolutely DID NOT admit to doing the things that they say I did, because I never did them.

What I did do was telling him NO and STOP multiple times, but as he claims that he never heard me say anything there is no way to prove that I did.

What I did do was desperately try to pull myself away from him, so much so that his arms were shaking with the force of holding me in place. There is no mention of this at all.

So half their reasons make me feel like utter shit, and the rest are totally wrong. I feel like they‚Äôve skimmed over the police reports and just picked out words that stood out to them and made a decision based on those few words.

I feel so angry. Again I feel powerless. I feel like they just don‚Äôt care, they‚Äôre busy because of Covid so what does it matter if a case doesn‚Äôt get looked at properly.

It‚Äôs no wonder the prosecution rate is so low if they do things like this. How many women has this happened to and they just couldn‚Äôt face opening that letter? How many did open the letter and just didn‚Äôt have the strength to fight it anymore?

I do have the right to appeal.

I feel like utter crap and I want to just curl up and ignore everyone and everything for the rest of my life. And if my appeal is rejected, I get to feel all these things all over again.

But I will call them tomorrow morning and start my appeal.

ihm03u,TwoXSupport,1598538505.0,"I am soooo tired of living with my ex. We broke up in January due to how abusive he has been over the course of the relationship. I had been trying to leave for a while and was stupid enough to give him a second-chance or he would threaten suicide or would say he wasn't leaving or that I was lying. Our relationship was a dead bedroom for the most part with him shaming me for what I liked, but as soon as I tried to break up, he'd try to start up sex and would act more passionate than before. He also rarely paid for his share of the expenses, prefering to blow it on restaurants, drugs, video games, whatever suited his fancy.

I kept on all of January on how we were breaking up. Usually, he would go back to a lovey-dovey phase after abuse, but that didn't happen and kept me into not falling back into ""well, there are some good times"". I also kept a ""momento"" from the absue to remind me of how bad and that I need to persist in not getting back together with him. The momento was a part of my key ring with shopper's cards on them that had gotten destroyed when he smashed my keys to the ground. I persevered and we ended it then, but he had no money to move-out and was blowing an average of $900 a month on everything he wanted instead of paying his share of the rent.


I feel overwhelmed by how disgusting he makes the house and how he never really does his share of the chores unless I get on him. He will leaves cups full of his tobacco spit everywhere, so it stinks and the cups now have what looks to be a film on them even after washing. He will put his dishes everywhere. Throw trash and laundry on the floor. Put clean laundry on the kitchen table. Even though, it is just the two of us, he makes so many dishes that within two days of me doing the dishes, the sinks ae overflowing with them and they are all over the counters, on the stove, on a clean cutting board. I want to eat healthier, but I feel so frustrated and exhausted by all the clean up I have to do just to cook. He also will empty out the fridge so he can make room for more food he won't eat by leaving the old food burried and rotting in a container on the counter. I feel so depressed looking at all the mess. In a month and a half, I never have to see his sorry, disgusting ass again, but that just feels so far away. What should I do?

I also noticed that I have stopped talking to friends or others because I keep thinking ""oh, I'll finally have privacy and be chipper once this is all over then I will reach out."" That, and I feel so bad bringing it up and being asked about it. Same with studying for work. I feel so overwhelmed.

I wanted to kiss, to see what it felt like, but I didn't want it to be with him. He smelled like weed and BO and listened to death metal. He walked behind me the whole time we were in the mall so he could get a good look of my body. I told him I wasn't okay with physical touch and he told me he understood, only to ask me if I changed my mind later. And then when he asked again I gave him a ""maybe"" because placating him felt easier than reminding someone who wouldn't listen anyway. 

The kiss happened in the back of his dirty car. I agreed to go back there with him. He put his hand on my thigh and held my hand. I looked towards the window hoping that he'd decide to take me home soon. And then he just grabbed my chin turned me towards him and kissed me...and to put it kindly it felt awful and I hated every moment of it. I let it happen and I didn't say no, so I consented. But it still felt awful. And I wish I would've said something so my first kiss could be with someone I actually wanted to kiss.

I felt sick to my stomach and scared so I asked him to drive home. And then tried to kiss me again at my door, even as I tried to move away because I didn't want it. He hugged me and then he kept his hands on my shoulders so he could hold me down.

l6e0xj,TwoXSupport,1611780442.0,"I've been thinking a lot lately about both my own experiences with feeling emotionally invalidated, as well as seeing other women in this situation. I feel as though a lot of the constant subtle emotional invalidation women experience often leads to us unintentionally emotionally invalidating ourselves sometimes. I've gone through some reaaaaal bullshit where for so long afterwards I would constantly second guess myself on whether it's okay for me to be upset or if I'm ""overreacting"". And in retrospect I look back on those experiences and think, ""What the fuck?! If anything, you had a right to be waaayy angrier and more upset than you were."" 

I think it's also that a lot of the mistreatment of women is done in a....subtle? way. Like, people tend to mistreat you with a smile on their face and a polite voice, e.g.: if your male boss asks you to do more work than reasonable as if it's a normal request, if a coworker talks over you but in a ""polite"" way. Or a guy you're seeing shows up late like it's no big deal and then smiles and asks how your day was. In those moments, you feel like the ""irrational"" one for being upset, because their energy is so casual and maybe even friendly, but their actions are really shitty, so you're in this position where you don't really know what to do, and you feel like the ""weird one"" for being upset, especially when they don't acknowledge that what they did is upsetting. 

All of this leads to so much second guessing and confusion, as well as internalized invalidation of our emotions, so much so that even if the other person is not directly trying to manipulate you in any way, you still end up feeling like you're not ""allowed"" to be upset. 

And the question remains of how do you unlearn years and years of this internalized bullshit? It's easy to say ""Well, I need to just work on it and try and validate my feelings more."" which is definitely a helpful step, but it's not that easy in practice, it's a catch-22 to say that ""If you want to stop second guessing your feelings, you need to stop second guessing your feelings."" You know? 

This isn't to say that it's a losing game, it's doable in time, but basically all of this is to say that I hope every man who has ever made a woman feel emotionally invalidated gets his dick stuck in a paper shredder :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/l6e0xj/emotional_invalidation_and_second_guessing/,Emotional invalidation and second guessing yourself.,Discussion,37,7,0.97,ALaVielleRussie

1avghrd,TwoXSupport,1708432140.0,"Hi everyone, I'm writing this because I could use some advice/perspective and I really have no one else in my life to turn to.

I am a 22 year old woman and I know that it's recommended that I go get a pap smear done, since I am of age and haven't had one yet. I'm not too excited about it. Not just because of the procedure itself, but because hospital/healthcare environments and I don't mix.

The other day, my mom found out that since I am over the age of 21, I should go get a pap smear done. The thing is though, my mom has no idea that I am low risk, and I can't tell her why, because that will open up a whole other can of worms.

I am Indian-American and my mom is an immigrant. Indian culture is very traditional and conservative. Some of the ideas within the culture include no sex before marriage no dating/boyfriends until you are ""older"" (age isn't always clear), no kissing, no PDA and there is a liking to arranged marriages. Children are expected to obey their parents (even as adults) and are essentially seen as property. I also currently live at home.

I am a virgin. I'm talking a VIRGIN virgin. I have never had a boyfriend, never been on a date, never kissed anyone, and never had sex. I know that I should probably get my smear test done anyway, but I'm low risk.

I have heard stories about virgin women going to the gyno to get a pap smear, only to be told that they didn't need it because they weren't sexually active. While this sounds like a relief that I don't need this procedure done just yet, I know that if this happens, I will go home and my mom will ask me how the pap smear went. I would then have to tell her that the doctor said that I didn't need one yet, because I'm a virgin. Meaning, in the future, when I AM sexually active (I don't plan on waiting for marriage) and I get my smear test done, and my mom asks me about it, she will know that I got one because I lost my virginity, which is something that she won't be happy about. Yes, I could lie, but am I just supposed to lie until marriage? I can only do so much. I'm also not a very good liar, and get really anxious, because of my strict upbringing. She is also very nosy.

Also, my mom has this all or nothing mentality when it comes to giving me advice and supporting me. Meaning, I could be her good child, do everything she says and she will support me and help me when needed, or I could go against her, ""be an adult"" and she would never support me or stand by me, since I ""think I know everything.""

This is where my conflict lies. If my doctor tells me that a pap smear isn't really necessary at this time, then I will have to go home and tell my mom that I didn't have it done. She is expecting me to have it done at my next appointment. if I tell my mom WHY I'm low risk, that is basically a way for her to keep track/know when I would lose my virginity. My mom really has no idea, and I don't want her finding out, since it would cause trouble and it may ruin my relationship with her.

Sorry I know that this is long and that this just may be my intrusive thoughts talking, but I could still use some advice/thoughts

EDIT: Hi everyone, sorry for the late response. I appreciate all of the advice, but I just want to clear up a few things.

1. I know why a pap smear is done. I know that I am low risk given the circumstances.
2. Yes, I am vaccinated against HPV. I got the vaccine about a decade ago as part of a routine series of vaccinations so there were really no questions there.
3. My mom has no idea that I'm low risk and more importantly WHY. She has little understanding about sexual health. (She doesn't know where a tampon goes. She didn't know what a cervix was until recently. I don't think she knows what an orgasm is.) If she finds out WHY, that opens doors to more problems. I don't want her tracking my virginity.
4. Yes, technically I could just say that the appointment went well and spare the details, but it usually doesn't stop there. She will pry over and over again. If I tell her that it's none of her business, then the accusations start, and so do the arguments and guilt tripping. It's not as easy as people are making it out to be. Remember, it's the culture.

oitfwu,TwoXSupport,1626103285.0,"So when I was 17 I used to post to ratings subreddits. I was a lonely kid
and I wanted validation. I got PMs from all sorts of people but most importantly I got one from some guy named mr. martin who told me I was so ugly that the only way to get men is to learn to be submissive and he could teach me.

I ended up taking the lessons because I was a dumbshit. Said lessons consisted of having me repeat to him that I was worthless and pathetic. After I said those words he said ""oh by the way I had your pic open while we were talking and I jerked off"". I ended up blocking him when he tried to make me roleplay giving a BJ.

But the story goes further than that. At 18 I made a new account and posted to the same sub and unsurprisingly he found me and insulted my looks some more and said now he has actual advice so I should add him on discord. I didn't trust him but I am always morbidly curious so I did and long story short he ended up talking about his foot fetish and how he likes children's feet. He told me I need to help him recover from his addiction so he can help me. He even told me about his age and posted a picture of himself. He looked like Napolean Dynamite's brother and he told me he was 26 years old. He said his ex girlfriend wanted him to quit his fetish and he feels bad.

Helping him, he said, was making him decide between 5 minutes and 10 minutes of jerking off and of course I was having none of this. I said ""how about you just fucking stop you pedo"" and he said ""you can't make me stop cold turkey"" and he guilted me into thinking it would hurt him to stop jerking off so he made me choose 5 minutes. I felt sick and wracked with guilt that I was now complicit in his crimes against children. I will live with that guilt until I am dead. I blocked him again, this time for good.

I'm 20 now, haven't been messaged by him at all so hopefully he is gone for good but I was looking back at this and this feels fucked up.

wu2qc1,TwoXSupport,1661096868.0,"EDIT: Thanks everyone for being so supportive! I'll be standing tall and be the better woman in the situation while also keeping my boundaries. It seems like there are some workplaces that aren't toxic, so when I look for a new job, I'll ask about mentorship for women and the company culture. For now, I think I'm in an okay spot because HR has been cracking down on women (and men) harassing other women. I will also continue to be proud to be queer and defy gender norms, even if that means not dressing/acting femme all the time (in response to some queerphobic-lite comments insinuating queer women have an advantage). I reject the 'not like other girls' narrative, and I support all queer women. If I can make it this far, then so can you.

ORIGINAL:
I'm also curious on how you all have found women who support each other. I found one through sheer luck.

I work in tech, in case this context is relevant, but I have experienced women tearing other women down in social and non-work groups/meetups/hangouts/etc.

At my previous and current jobs, women have:

- Fired me without cause, saying, ""I can do whatever I want.""
- Denied me a promotion by spreading rumors.
- Denied me another promotion by criticizing made-up, subjective metrics while ignoring my top objective metrics established for everyone since the company existed.
- Made unsolicited comments on my body and clothes, then quit during an HR investigation when I reported them and quoted their comments verbatim.
- Mockingly quoted behind my back what a terminated man said about my body behind my back, after he was terminated from my HR complaint.

I found a single woman at work who supports me, and that's it. Weirdly enough, I am also the first and only women (sort of) who supports her. She has also experienced other women tearing her down by:

- Damaging her performance review for a promotion by spreading rumors about her work ethic.
- Abruptly insulting and denying help after being friendly initially, usually after getting personal information about her.
- Laughing loudly at her while she was choking on something, without doing anything.

I mean, just, what the actual fuck? I thought we're supposed to lift each other up? I have some anecdotes from my personal life, but there's just too many. The above is enough to show the gist of what my, and apparently other kind women's, experiences are with what seems to be narcissistic women?

For the first time in my life, I started setting some extreme boundaries. For example, I once saw a female coworker trip on her heels and drop her food, and while I instinctively stood up, I ultimately chose to do nothing because I didn't know how many women she has or will harass. This felt so fucked up, but I just can't know if this will be the one of the few who doesn't tear other women down. There's just no way that it's a coincidence that I've gone through 3 years of this, and hear years' worth of similar anecdotes from another woman who is basically my mentor.

I have the male experience to contrast this with. I am genderfluid, and I have never experienced men tearing each other down so viciously like this. Sometimes a man will get upset at another one, but there's actually some event that justifies that. They don't randomly decide, ""Yeah, let me fuck this man up."" While presenting female, I have received more support from men in tech than women.

For those of you who experience this, what do you do? How do you find women who actually support each other? How do you find social groups, meetups, clubs, workplaces, etc. that have women who lift each other up? I was a bit ranty, but I'm only interested in practical advice, if at least to help emotionally cope if it's not possible to navigate through all of these toxic women.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/wu2qc1/what_do_you_do_when_so_many_women_at_work_are/,What do you do when so many women at work are trying to tear you down?,Support - Advice Welcome,37,16,0.83,DeliciousMadame84

qnah7o,TwoXSupport,1636116855.0," I   apologize if this isn't the right spot for this, I would appreciate it  if I could be pointed in the right direction if it isn't. Cross posted  to emotional abuse subreddit but I noticed it isn't very active and I'm  concerned the situation is escalating quickly as I think the possible  abuser has figured me out as a threat.

I   am a survivor of an emotionally abusive relationship, I got out of it   more out of luck and the abuser growing too tired of dealing with my   mental health issues. It took me almost two years to recognize the   extent of what she had done.

Unfortunately,   my favorite person in the world at the moment who has been wonderful   and supportive and everything I've been trying to find in a person has   become very suddenly withdrawn with no explanation other than the   occasional ""I'm sorry I'm tired"" when previously she had assured me I   could always come to her no matter what. This has also coincided with   her making some changes that have prevented her from socializing outside   of work and her partner, who I was also close with, has ghosted me for   over a week now. It was after her partner ghosted me that I noticed  the  withdrawing behavior and it's only gotten worse.

I   don't want to go into full details here, maybe there is somewhere   better I can go for help, but I am starting to strongly suspect her   partner may be controlling and emotionally manipulating her, I kind of   think her partner may have recognized me as a threat (I've been standing   up against similar emotional manipulators recently where they could   absolutely see) and have opted to shut me out and control their   environment, which is tied to my best friend's environment, they are   roommates and this partner is helpless without her.

I   guess I'll also just say there have been lots of red flags from their   behavior on Twitter, including similarities to thinking patterns my   abuser had, they are very smart and aware of psychology as well as the   dynamic they are in with their partner, and my confirmation bias is   really damn strong in favor of this person I loved them too but all   answers keep pointing to my worst fear.

Also,   they tweeted the other day about how they ""think sometimes about how  if  they lost their supports (their partner/my best friend) they would  just  be helpless and die."" and I guess I can't help but think about how  that  sounds a hell of a lot like threatening suicide if left, just in  well, a  more subtle way. Like I said, this person is smart.

I'm   really really scared. The friend is someone who saved my life, I'm not   sure I'd be here still if it wasn't for her. I have learned to let go  of  toxic people, but I can't let her go, I can't stand the thought of  any  hurt coming to her and if she's getting used like I was I just  don't  know what to do, because I didn't have any idea and refused to  let  anyone talk poorly about my abuser for over a year after she left.

njt6wj,TwoXSupport,1621845711.0,"When I was young I was really into gaming for a couple of years, I think it was between the ages of 13-16 or something. Through a clan (basically a group of people getting a common name and playing together and talking on Skype) I met a guy my age, X. We became sort of friends, together with the the rest of the clan. The years go by, I stop gaming and lose contact with all of them. Except X.

At this point I feel like I need to clarify that I thought of him as ""sort of a friend"" but not a close one. It was just gaming related, we never had a close relationship and it's not like I suddenly abandoned him. But I guess when I was 13-14 we did have a bit of fun, sure. Just keep that in mind. 

I'm growing up and start having less and less in common (we're still about 16) with him now that I'm not gaming, and have no personal interest in being friends with him since... I honestly never thought of him as much fun as a person. But he *insists* on staying in touch. Which wouldn't be *that* bad if it wasn't for the fact that I REALLY have no interest in being ""friends"" (which would also be unfair to him) and the fact that every time I write a reply, no matter how short, I get a fucking essay back.

He sends me birthday cards and Christmas cards every year. He has invited me to go with him and his company on a retreat in his country once, although we had never met. He just bought me a birthday gift and sent it to me, even though I told him not to (idk what it is, it's at my mums place and I'm hours away). Before I told him not to get me anything he wondered if I was saving up for a car.... As if he wanted to contribute to it or something. 

I'm 25 now. So this has been going on for ten years. 

For ten years I've tried to grey rock him, only replying with short but polite answers or, when I just can't deal with it anymore, ignoring him. Which makes me feel terrible but idk what else to do, I can't write a reply to essay after essay. Even if I write only a short sentence, he still replies with at least five things I'd have to answer, and then he expands those replies, and so on. You're probably thinking *poor guy, just tell him the truth!* but the more time passes the more anxiety I get thinking about actually telling him I don't want to be ""friends"". I've always thought he'd lose interest but he *never does*. But I just can't bring myself to actually telling him, it gives me major anxiety. I wish he'd just grow tired of me. 

I seriously don't understand what he is getting out of this, because I make myself sound really boring. And he has mentioned other friends, so it can't be that he considers me his only friend. 

This last birthday he's been more obnoxious than usual which is what finally pushed me to write here. I get text messages waking me up in the middle of the night. He can write something and then 20 minutes later write something else, or just send a smiley. 

He wrote three messages this morning, even though I haven't opened the last five ones. 

It's like I have a puppy I never chose to buy, or something. 

He has never made a move on me and hasn't reacted when I've talked about boyfriends so I don't think it's anything romantic. 

I just feel... Exhausted. I've showed in every way possible without actually saying it out loud that I have no interest in being friends. Why can't he just talk to people who actually want to talk to him!? 

I'm starting to resent him because he makes me feel like a terrible, mean person. I suck for leading him on to thinking we have a friendship but at the same time I don't know what I'm doing to make him think that, either.

jz8ump,TwoXSupport,1606097884.0,"TW: passing mention of sexual assault, rough handling, and r\*\*\*

After strings of terrible experiences with Drs, lo and behold my first experience with an \*OBGYN was horrific. (See \* below before you skip straight to telling me to report the Dr.)

I'm not squirrely about 90% of things in my life. My first sexual encounter wasn't painful. I can sit in a tight MRI machine with a cage over my face for an hour at a time and not need to escape. I can sit through painful scalp injections for alopecia treatment across 20% of my scalp and only ask for a break when we're 90% of the way through. I can handle the invasive nasopharynx COVID 19 swab tests with no issue. I experience 6/10 - 9/10 pain on the regular when I mistakenly ingest things that contain dairy and I just sweat through it with tylenol. I fancy myself to usually be a pretty hardy and mildly robust critter with a resilient mind... **But hell do I never want to see another OBGYN again.**

My first pelvic exam was done when I was 22 and the Dr. was so rough that I really can't see myself ever getting another exam let alone a ever get a pap smear done. It really messed with my mind that a woman could hear that it's the first time in an OBGYN's office and then handle me in the roughest way I've ever experienced. Even the rape that I experienced was physically gentler than what this woman did to my insides. It honestly felt like she was being intentionally rough and if she wasn't then she has the most careless person in the world.

**I really would like to hear from other women about their positive experiences, especially from women who have been sexually assaulted, about good experiences with OBGYNs.** I have questions:

1. Is being traumatized by your first pelvic exam normal?
   1. If no then what is a pelvic exam supposed to be like?
2. Are there OBGYNs out there who do not roughly yank instruments through your pelvis just so they can get through their appointments when they're behind schedule?
3. Can I hope that people would be respectful while giving me an exam when in their eyes I could be disrespecting my body by not coming in once a year? (I have had other women in their fields punish me or treat me worse if in their view I do not ""treat myself right."" It honestly felt like the OBGYN was doing to me.)
4. Why should I get a pap smear when I would rather die of cancer then go through more traumatic experiences while I am awake?
   1. I acknowledge that this notion is irrational and may sound insensitive. I know what dying of cancer looks like and really, my fear of having any Dr. come near my genitals is so extreme that I would rather die in a horrific way a decade or two from now over experiencing more trauma associated with something that's supposed to help me.
   2. I will go to a therapist soon to talk this out. I just moved states and am straightening out health insurance and choosing my PCP.
5. If I ever go to an OBGYN again, what do I tell them to make them be aware that I am absolutely terrified of them and that they'll give me a panic attack if they don't handle me right? I'm seriously fine with like 90% of the crap that has to throw at me but people getting near my vagina makes me extraordinarily uncomfortable.

\* There is no way I will remember who this Dr. is as I saw her briefly before I moved out of the state she practiced in. I saw her a few years ago at a free clinic, there is not chance I would ever find her again. I can't report her because I have no idea who she is and unfortunately I was too emotional at the time to tell her that she did an awful job with the pelvic exam and that she had a horrible bedside manner. Next time I will do better in giving immediate feedback which will include expletives if it's anything like the first time I got an exam.

\*\* In the title I typed women(+) because I hoped to include any people, including trans and non binary people, who get pelvic exams in the conversation. I am not sure how to phrase that, if you know a better way to say that succinctly then please let me know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/jz8ump/i_would_like_to_hear_from_other_women_about_their/,"I would like to hear from other women(+) about their positive experiences, especially from those who have been sexually assaulted, about good experiences with OBGYNs and pelvic exams.",Support - Advice Welcome,31,18,0.97,woodthrushes

It started in January. He found me sitting alone in the school hallways (I was a wallflower) . He was selling coca cola to other students in the hallway but gave me one for free and asked for my number.

At the time I appreciated the kind gesture and the attention so I gave him my number, but I know now that was the start of the 'love bombing' stage. He love bombed me even more over text, saying that he thought we were soulmates because I took journalism and that I made him feel like he was on ecstasy and he was so amazed that I was so beautiful and said I was a perfect 10.

I...made a dick move then. He asked me to rate his attractiveness honestly and I said 6/10. After that night of texting he went back to my spot in the school hallways with candy and soda, gave those to me, and told me he was so rich he could buy me anything I wanted. I felt overwhelmed with all of the gifts that I told him I didn't know what I wanted.  

He got really mad when I didn't let him get me gifts. He'd text me every morning asking what drink and what candy I wanted, I'd say ""no thank you"" and he'd say ""no is not an option, pick"". 

He'd alternate between showering me in affection and telling me I was ugly and he didn't even like me that much. He told me his friends think I look like a horror movie monster. He simultaneously wanted me to be sexier (begged me to become a cheerleader) and to be innocent (told me all the other girls were whores and that I was special to him) 

He wanted me to skip class for him and called me ""goody two shoes"" when I said no. He touched my inner thighs even when I got so uncomfortable I told him to stop, saying ""Don't worry it's not like that, I'm just a touchy guy, I do that to everyone"".

On Valentine's Day he didn't even show up. He ghosted me for weeks and when he came back, candy heart in tow, he said he was busy and forgot, citing there were times I didn't respond to his texts.

Then starting in march he just would show up and talk to me only occasionally, to the point I wondered if we were even together still or if he liked me anymore. 

He broke up with me a month later. He said that he deliberately cheated on me (as much as someone can cheat in a chaste relationship) and that his friends approved of her so he was leaving her for me.

Do you or do you not think that Drag and Drag queens *could* be perceived as misogynistic?

On one hand, it‚Äôs camp and creative and quite possibly/probably just a bit of fun. 

On the other, at its core, is it not men putting on a parody of womanhood, mocking and stereotyping women?

I‚Äôm not entirely sure what I think. I do think there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with a privileged group poking fun at at a marginalised group.

I mean, because of our womanhood we are oppressed, degraded, objectified (by men and patriarchy) yet men (drag queens) wear it as a costume, as a performance - and honestly, that strikes a funny cord with me. 

I‚Äôm probably overthinking it but I do think it‚Äôs a fascinating topic of discussion so please share your thoughts :) really sorry if I‚Äôve offended anyone btw

I've been in three real relationships: 3 years, 6,5 years and my current is still going strong on 2,5 years. I'm planning to marry this one, I couldn't wish for anything better. But. I'm afraid I won't be loved if I don't have sex. I feel like the strongest connection is when I have sex with someone and afterwards there's more touch and in general more affection. This has been the case with all of my relationships (if important, I ended both of the prior relationships). Most of the time I want to have sex as much as my SO does, so it shouldn't really be an issue. I just feel like it's the sex that keeps the spark alive and I'm afraid I won't be loved if we don't have it. Is this something anyone else is thinking about? I'm not sure what to do with my thoughts and feelings bc my SO says he loves me no matter what. He is very loving, caring and touches me a lot (and the same was my ex's) so I don't know why I'm so afraid of not being loved if I say no to sex a few times.

he was unemployed for a while, during that time we hung out many times a week. he was still depressed but he had a little more energy, he was able to be lighthearted and flirty and so so so sweet to me. he is still like that, but his current job is exhausting him. we have been hanging out less because he is completely burnt out mentally and physically. 

i went over to his house yesterday for the first time in over a week consisting of less communication. i could tell he has gotten worse. i can get him to smile sometimes and we talk like normal. but he was moping *a lot* more and looking at me with this empty look in his eyes. i can tell he is so tired. he said he is too tired and detached from reality to consider su*cide any more. 


his mental illness doesnt have a massive toll on my life. i love this man so much and i will stick with him thru anything. it is sad sometimes, but i am willing to endure the sadness because i understand and love him deeply. 


i just need some advice on what exactly to say to him. i always say things like, 

""it will be okay"", 

""i care about you"", 

""i understand how you feel"", 

""things will be better some day"", 

""life is worth sticking around for"", 

""i am here for you"". 

""you are important.""

i suggest he should get a different job that isnt so exhausting, but he doesnt say much when i suggest that. ive given him the phone number for the psychiatrist i go to. ive talked to him about medication and therapy, ive told him about applying for medical insurance and financial aid, i even printed the papers for him. 


he is really really depressed. he gets overwhelmed, anxious, and discouraged very easily. he has a hard time focusing. he cant pay any bills, cant buy groceries. 


is there anything else i can do to help? i have experienced this level of mental illness before, i am doing significantly better now. but i know exactly how he feels. the turning point for me was attempting su*cide, i dont want it to come down to that for him. i know he has to pursue help for himself, but i want to know if there is anything else i can say/do to encourage him.

edit: i would also like to add, i buy him groceries & sometimes cook for him, i help him keep his house clean, i give him thoughtful presents, i help him pay bills sometimes.

So this one guy who keeps trying to play pool with my ex (who is my roommate and we aren't really talking now) keeps calling him my husband, when I see him. I'm not going to correct him for obvious reasons. His English is so-so but there are obvious language issues and I generally just smile and nod a lot.

Anyways, my neighbor has brought be back some fruit from traveling to Mexico for business, mangos and watermelons, and a thing of tequila I gave him $20 for because I didn't ask for any of this stuff and didn't want him to start feeling like I owed him. Tonight I was on my patio and he was walking around looking for his phone (he dropped it off his balcony two floors above me) and is pretty obviously drunk. We talk for a bit, even though I want to go inside, my dinner (reheated double daves pepperoni rolls) is ready. He asks me about my dinner and basically says I should bring him a plate of food.  

I know it's stupid, but guys, he knows where I live. I have to be nice to him so I bring him a pepperoni roll (1/3rd of my dinner!) and then he gets weird and says I should buy him dinner tomorrow. I agree and laugh and go inside and at this point I'm just hoping that he was too drunk to remember.  

It's so fucking frustrating placating people. We have one main door the apartment and then a patio with two other doors, and my ex doesn't always remember to lock the sliding door that leads to his room. It just really sucks when someone who scares you knows where you live. It sucks that I can't be anonymous and unnoticed and have to act like I want this kind of attention. For the record, this guy does mention his wife a lot. I feel like it's a tactic to put me at ease though. I don't have the luxury of pretending that he's a good guy (and was just drunk tonight). Life has taught me that women do not have that luxury.  

Edit: I should add: this guy doesn't scare me in general. But I hate that he is completely unaware, even though being 15 years older than me, that I do not want to hang out with him and am only being polite. He keeps pressing for us to hang out together, and in my experience that means that the dude wants to get you alone for sex. Whether or not you are into it.

I‚Äôm absolutely stunned and worried. 

Here‚Äôs the full story: 

My in-laws and my wife raised my niece. My brother in-law and his girlfriend essentially abandoned her for the first decade of her life. Both her parents and my in-laws are incredibly toxic and harmful people. 

Let‚Äôs just say this kid has had some problems.

Not the least of which occurred 3 years ago when she was 13. She was attempting a romantic (and likely sexual) relationship with a 19 year old man. It was a scary situation because the guy was doing standard grooming and conditioning of her. When I was told all of this I went to their house and asked her to tell me about it away from the in-laws. I wanted them removed from it because of how horribly they handle said types of situations (I.e. they didn‚Äôt know if they should contact the authorities because they didn‚Äôt want to ‚Äúruin *his* life‚Äù).

Bri, my niece, agreed and we went out and got some milkshakes and just talked about it. I made sure to inform her multiple times that the conversation ends when she wants it to and that she doesn‚Äôt have to tell me anything she doesn‚Äôt want to. 

I mostly just asked her questions about this guy and her relationship with him. Why do you think he‚Äôs trying to date you as opposed to people his own age? Do know it‚Äôs illegal for you two to be intimate? Are his friends and family aware of you? Why wouldn‚Äôt he tell them about you if he didn‚Äôt think he was doing anything wrong?

She seemed comfortable with this situation. She volunteered plenty of information and seemed engaged. The conversation was about two hours long. I even let her smoke some of my wife‚Äôs cigarettes. I‚Äôm usually pretty square about it when she visits on weekends, but I didn‚Äôt want her nic-fitting while talking about this heavy stuff (she started smoking at 10). 

She reasoned her way toward understanding the inherent problem with the guy. I wasn‚Äôt judgmental, overly-critical, or insulting. I thought it went well.

Fast forward to now. She‚Äôs 16, and dating a recently graduated 18 year old. She had a pregnancy scare and with him and My in-laws and Bri‚Äôs parents all freaked out about it. Her dad, my brother in-law, outright called her a whore and her mom told her she needs to ‚Äúkeep her legs closed‚Äù. She was hearing these things for days in her own home before anyone told me or my wife about it. 

They went out to get a pregnancy test and while saying these things in the car her dad was hard braking with her in the back causing her to bump into the seat.

The second we heard about any of this we called her. Without even talking about the situation I told her ‚ÄúBri, I love you, and I don‚Äôt care what you do as long as it is safe, legal, and consensual. Please next time come to us, you deserve better than them‚Äù.

She was surprised and while crying said ‚ÄúThank you‚Äù.

My concern is why was she surprised? I‚Äôve always been open and honest with her, but she thought I‚Äôd react more like her dad did. Did I do something wrong? What can I do better? Or does it just have nothing to do with me, she is just exposed to too much misogyny to trust me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/rtgo3b/what_can_i_do_better/,What can I do better?,Support - Advice Welcome,28,8,0.89,JericIV

During this time I was talking to people, playing drinking games, and even gave my snapchat info to a friend of a friend. According to all my friends I seemed fine. Then proceeded to throw up for 3 hours at least. After that I was okay according to them but, I sat around a lot and wasn‚Äôt very engaging. Eventually my group, including Vic, left the party. We went back to Sarah‚Äôs house to regroup. The minute we got into her apartment I crashed on the couch. Vic and everyone else went to get some fast food down the street. After that they decide to call it a night and disbanded.

When I woke up the next day I specifically asked Sarah, Vic and one other person to fill me in on what had happened. Apparently I only remembered the first hour of the party and nothing else. I didn‚Äôt remember talking to other people. I didn‚Äôt remember talking to the girl now added on my snapchat. I didn‚Äôt remember telling an embarrassing story to a group of strangers. I didn‚Äôt remember sitting on the couch after being sick while waiting for the Uber. I didn‚Äôt remember walking to the Uber. I didn‚Äôt remember coming into Sarah‚Äôs place the night before. I didn‚Äôt even remember falling asleep on the couch. The reason this is important to note is because Vic knew about this incident. He saw me almost the whole night and filled me in on everything that happened. Which means that he knows I can be black out drunk and seemingly coherent at the same time. Unfortunately for me he witnesses this one other time with my group of friends around. The second incident also took place in 2018. After that I didn‚Äôt get back out drunk for a long time.

Important event #2: Jump to September 2020. Vic and his friend John had been casually drinking all. They were celebrating John‚Äôs birthday by playing video games and drinking. After John left Vic invited me over to hangout. At first everything seemed fine. Vic and I were playing games and cutting up with his roommates. Then he slowly started to go from tipsy, to drunk. Which wasn‚Äôt really surprising since he had been drinking all day. At first he was his usual drunk self. However, as time passed I could tell he was getting more and more incoherent. Going from drunk to black out drunk. I took him to his room and gave him some bread. It was really awkward as heavily flirted with me during this time and even whipped out his dick twice. I told him to put it away both time and to go to sleep since he was drunk. While we had slept together before this it was still awkward since he was obviously drunk. Nothing bad happened and I didn‚Äôt do anything questionable or inappropriate. When he woke up the next morning he asked me what happened because he couldn‚Äôt remember. I told him and he thanked me for not doing anything sexual with him. That‚Äôs when we agreed to not have sex with the other person while they were drunk. I thought this agreement would be fine going forward because it was his idea, he was grateful that I didn‚Äôt sleep with him in this moment, and I thought I could trust him. Boy was I fucking wrong.

Important event #3: Jump forward yet again to June 2021. I go out with another friend Jess and some of her close friends. We bar hopped to 3 different spots starting at 11 pm and ending at 3:30 am. Since I was feeling fine I decide to drive home. On the way there I stopped at Vic‚Äôs place. He lived less than a minute away from Jess so I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be a big deal. Plus, he said I could crash with him if this ever happened since all my friends live in the city and I live in the suburbs. Keeping this in mind and the agreement we made I thought I‚Äôd be fine. I get there and at first everything is fine. I drink some more while I‚Äôm there. Then it‚Äôs not fine. I descend from tipsy to drunk. Not only did Vic point out that I was drunk and he was ‚Äúgoing to cut me off‚Äù. His roommate even mentioned that I was drunk after watching me stumble around the kitchen. I remember getting to his place, taking 3 more shots, going to the kitchen, walking back to his room, and then it gets fuzzy. I remember flirting with him. I remember the beginning of sex. I remember a few parts in-between. Then I remember it ending. The only reason it stood out to me is because I thought it lasted for 15 minutes. I would later come to find out it lasted 2 hours. Then we went to sleep. It was only the next day that I realized I didn‚Äôt remember all of it. On top of that he said, ‚ÄúThat he felt like he took advantage of me.‚Äù At first I didn‚Äôt say anything to him because I didn‚Äôt want to start a fight, dumb I know.

My life gets crazy. I get kick out of my home. Have to stay with my brother. Get a new job. Flip to the night shift. Move again and then again. Then I get really sick for a month and mainly sleep and work.

Important event #4: I find rape hentai on Vic‚Äôs computer. All the emotions come flooding back. What I tried to write off as a mistake now seems like something more sinister. I confront him. He tells me he doesn‚Äôt like the porn for that reason. It‚Äôs just a coincidence. That he likes rough sex but rape is too much for him. He tells me that he‚Äôs sorry for what he did. That our agreement didn‚Äôt even cross his mind that night. That he didn‚Äôt realize how drunk I was. He thought I was sobering up after leaving the kitchen and that I didn‚Äôt drink much at his house. Then he drops a bombshell and tell me he asked me to sleep with him first. I didn‚Äôt remember that. I thought I flirted with him first and so I was to blame. Apparently, I was wrong. He did say he was sorry. He even cried which is very, very rare for him. He really seemed like he was in pain for hurting me. He said he might have a sex problem. However, he did call me out for flirting with him that night. On top of that he bumped all of this alcohol down drain because I drank more when I got to his place and now I couldn‚Äôt do that again.

I don‚Äôt know what to think. I want to forgive him. I want this to be over this. I don‚Äôt want to be angry anymore. However, I can‚Äôt stop being angry. Sex is now 100% off the table for our relationship. I don‚Äôt even want him to hold my hand or sit close to me. But what if we stay friends. Is that a good idea? What if I accidently get this drunk again around him? Will I be able to forgive myself if I put myself in this situation? I already blamed myself enough the first time. What if I accidently get so drunk in the future that I can‚Äôt remember anything. Then I‚Äôll have to take him at his word if no one else is around. Can I really trust him to be honest? Is he really sorry? Does he partially blame me? Can I actually expect him to change? I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want our friendship to be over but I don‚Äôt know if I can forgive him and move on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/q2diw2/my_friend_vic_fake_name_took_advantage_of_me_i/,"My friend ‚ÄúVic‚Äù (fake name) took advantage of me.

When I started having sex things got weird, a bunch of times I start bleeding during or after sex. My bf has a large penis so he hits my cervix every time. It was horrific for him to pull out and there was so much blood. Sex can be really uncomfortable for me, penetration feels like an odd ache. Lately even gentle finger penetration makes me bleed. My discharge has been more brown than red and like a wet lint texture. When I check myself with my finger it feels like there's a coating of brown gunk on my vaginal walls and it comes off easily. I had my birth control changed from seasonique to tri sprintec a week ago to see if things would get better, but it hasn't stopped. I couldn't find anything online that describes the sort of internal vaginal shedding I'm having or why I bleed if my cervix is touched at all. Idk if it's related but I also have a really hard time using the bathroom. Pushing out poop is way too difficult than it should be for someone my age.

I'm usually very good at taking it on time and not missing pills, but the past few months I've just messed up. Three months in a row!

In July I dropped a pill down the drain and- stupidly- just missed that day entirely and continued the next day with the next pill. I subsequently had some brown spotting and then my period that month was lighter than usual and started just spotty.

In the next pack, I had a trip and wanted to skip my period for the first time ever so I didn't take the placebo pills and started the next pack a week early. I had spotting a couple weeks into that pack and then my normal period.

And then THIS pack- my gosh. In the fist week I missed two or three pills in a row and had to play catch up (take two pills a day until you catch up) and now I'm having a bonus period in the second week of the pack.

Hey all, I hope that this is okay to post here, I'm sure I will be let know if it isn't.

Sought a lot of professional support. Reached out and tried to make a genuine support network of friends for the first time.

I'm finally getting to a place where I want to date again, I think. It's mainly that right before I ovulate every month my brain goes, ""it's TIME to start dating again and get on the apps."" lol

But I go back and forth. C-PSTD is a hard things to live with, and sometimes I feel like I want to be intimate with someone so badly, but then I turn around and the thought is incredibly overwhelming.

I'm still seeking professional support. I guess I'm wondering if other people with similar experiences ever got to a point where it wasn't so overwhelming before trying to take the plunge.

kdi1zt,TwoXSupport,1608021492.0,"Hello, this is my first post ever so I am not entirety sure how to go about this but I really do need some advice. I have a close friend I have known since eighth grade, we went to high school together and were absolutely inseparable until I moved a dozen states away. I know that it's silly to expect that nothing would change but I really don't know what to do.

She was the first person to stand up for me when I was getting bullied and has stuck to my side like glue ever since. Yin and Yang we called ourselves, where ever one of us was you could always find the other. We were as close as sisters, she stuck with me through my suicidal breakdowns and I mourned with her when her mother passed away.

Moving is nothing new for me, this was the ninth time in eighteen years but I thought that since we has promised, since we had sworn to the silly ""best friends forever"" that she would always pick up when I called. Though now I'm questioning how long our forever really is. Because of the pandemic and having moved to a new state she is the only close friend I really have and the only one I talk to about everything going on in my life.

At first we would call and face-time constantly and then when online school picked back up our talks dwindled as expected. But now it feels like I am the only one reaching out. As though we are on different paths and she wants to walk without me. Every time I call she says she's busy or with other friends, or will speak with me a moment before excusing herself. A few times I understand but thirteen cannot be my imagination, right?

Now I hesitate to even call her. Right now she is really struggling with even graduating senior year, and I am receiving back all of my early application answers from colleges. I get so excited when I get accepted and she is the only one that I really talk to about all of this. But I also don't want to annoy her with my constant bombardment of acceptances when she's struggling with every core class she has. I have offered to help but she procrastinates so terribly that she hasn't even started some missing assignment from September let alone have time to take my feedback into consideration.

Maybe I should just let her go now. It gets tiring begin the only one to reach out and I also want to focus on maintaining my grades until graduation.

CW: fear of SA/SH

I am feeling deeply burdened by my body/gender expression the last few months. It feels like there is no safe place for women or femme-presenting people to exist. I don't know any woman that leaves their house without a weapon (mine is pepper spray). I didn't actually even realize how deeply I was holding on to this until I joined this group just a moment ago and began immediately crying (thank you for making this group). 

I've felt this way for a long time, but a few months ago things started to really bubble up for me. I volunteer with an organization in a poor area of my city and while I was there I witnessed a woman walking naked, deliriously through the street barefoot. As I recount it, I am sobbing. She was so vulnerable. I wanted to wrap a blanket around her and take her someplace safe to rest, but she was not mentally stable and could not be safely approached. It pains me so deeply to think of all the women who live my worst nightmare on a weekly basis. Days later, I was thinking about her as I went to the grocery store. While there, I witnessed a man check a woman out and as she moved into another aisle, he followed her for a moment. I felt like I was screaming and no one could hear me. In that same moment, a cashier was trying to get my attention and called me ""Miss."" It came suddenly crashing down on me that we fail women, and that women are violated on a daily basis, and despite that I was wearing men's jeans, a hoodie, and a baseball cap, I was/am perceived as a woman. I got into my car and screamed. 

I was thinking about the woman downtown every day for weeks and often woke up thinking about her, so my therapist suggested I write her a letter (that I will probably never share). It did actually help, but for whatever reason in the last few weeks it's coming up again. This time, I feel a lot less sad and am holding a lot more rage. The other night I listened to Knifey by Amyl and the Sniffers and stomped and screamed and hit my wall, literally having to stop and take a breath and sit because I was so tired from being so angry. The fact that this is getting a physical reaction out of me is why I'm seeking some validation. Does anyone else feel trapped in their body? Nearly condemned to a life of harassment and discomfort?

This discomfort with my womanhood has made me reconsider my gender identity and pronouns as well, I now go by (she/they). 

I should admit here that validation often makes me feel better, but also frustrates me because we are ALL having this same dehumanizing experience. Such is life, at least we have each other.  

More info that I just want to share that has been contributing to these feelings, but not essential to the post: I shaved my head a few years ago and found that the number of men harassing me really decreased, which I loved. I was talking to my female friend about it the other day and my male friend was in the room. She was saying she wanted to shave her head and I was encouraging and told her that fact. My male friend kind of scoffed and said that one of his partner had shaved her head and she still got repeatedly catcalled. It really upset me and I snapped to him and said something to the effect of ""Great, thank you so much for your valuable input. I guess I'll never escape then."" It upset me for a couple reasons, but the main one being that I talk to my male friend about this particular issue really often and he is very aware of how I feel about it. It felt really insensitive.

That day, we all went to play our usual volleyball and a male acquaintance said something I didn't like, so I just kind of kept away from him. Throughout the whole rest of the session, he was poking fun and saying things like ""so you just hate me now"" and ""oh i'm a bad person?"" Why do you need my validation if you don't care enough to consider why a joke about giving someone something they don't want is offensive? Additionally, some of the guys are younger and they make a lot of jokes with sexual innuendos that make me uncomfortable. They really only joke to each other, but in general those jokes are targeted at women, so I don't like it. Maybe I'm too sensitive. 

Also, I go to play parties every now and then and I find it pretty difficult to feel attractive while not identifying with any gender. Last night I was at one of these parties and there was a rule that no solos were allowed upstairs. I wanted to go up, and a guy I've met previously told me he knows the people at the bottom and can get us up there without being together. So we went over and they said we have to prove we're together and so he kissed me. I wanted to throw up. I literally said ""Ah then, it's ok I'm good."" And he was like ""Nah don't worry"" and just kissed me. And then kissed my friend. And then the bouncers said it wasn't convincing and we needed to use tongue and I stood there half in shock that he just fucking did that and half embarrassed that I let him and then while I stood there in shock, he kissed me again. And I pushed his tongue out of my mouth. The bouncers questioned us again and I was ready to fucking leave, but there were people in line and my friend wanted to go up so I just didn't know what to do or say, I needed a minute. A guy who volunteers there stood on the side and told them it was convincing and it was clear we were lovers. I talked to the volunteer after and he was really kind. The guy who kissed me said sorry real quick and went upstairs with my friend. I told a couple of the volunteers last night that I really didn't like that new requirement, and felt a little violated. 

Am I the problem? Why do I feel so sensitive to all of these things?",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/116pgom/ventdiscussion_about_feeling_safe_outside_of_my/,Vent/discussion about feeling safe outside of my home,Vent/Discussion Post ,26,2,0.96,peppa011
q8p77f,TwoXSupport,1634306846.0,"When COVID second wave hit, my college decided to throw the students out of the campus on a short notice. I had made a particularly close friend over there and we had been friends since the past 2 years. Neither of us could tolerate the idea of going back to our respective  home environments because of the bad experience both of us have had there. We also did so well working together, pushing each other and helping each other out. We're PhD students and it is a massively collaborarive work. So we decided to move in together in my parents' empty apartment (they don't live there). We had that space and took advantage of it and it was truly a joy to live together with a friend who meant so much to me. We had a whole plan to work together till the end of 2021 and things were working out great. We even finished a paper that got published a few weeks ago!

She's also married and has been in a weird situation for the most part of the marriage. She and the husband were both severely pressurized by their families to get married and neither of them could say no. The husband also seems to be dealing with mental health issues and absolutely despises his family because of their interference in his life including forcing him to get married. By extension he also resents my friend, to the extent that he refused to talk to her for months and months (7-8 months to be precise).

They eventually got talking but he said he has tried but feels no connection with her and wants a family with some one he actually loves. But since he feels that he has no choice, just like my friend, he half heartedly has been trying to interact, so he does a routine call every night but my friend did not find any genuine effort from his side. during those calls. She doesn't like the in-laws either who keep interfering trying to get their marriage to work and seem to have not much of care and respect for my friends carrer.

So we were staying together for 2 months and she said she wanted to go and stay with her husband because she wants to 'give him time' and try to talk face to face. She had a plan to go and come back after a month or so.  But she went there and just assimilated in that environment and decided not to come back but still kept me hanging by not being straightforward about this. Kept things too open ended. Things aren't great with the husband. They barely interact and husband 'doesnt give a fuck' according to her own words. And she decided to still stay and abandon the plan that we had so clearly agreed upon. I also feel like shit seeing her not able to leave that environment because she just wants to keep the peace or something. I don't understand her choices. She has always complained about this marriage and has even talked about separation repeatedly when worked up. Now she tells me she's very sorry she did this to me and that she deseves my annoyance and disappointment. She said she tried but she had a situation she couldn't get out of. It's the same shit I've heard over and over.

I am hurt and disappoint at being taken for granted. It is frustrating to see some one abandon their own vision for themselves and give their time to someone who just feels trapped with them. I do not get it why someone would give so much priority a man whose idea of dealing with such an issue is to just stop talking to his wife for months and not treat her with basic dignity that anyone deserves.

So I (21F) had sex with a guy for the first time (ever) last night. We did try to have sex earlier this week but he got soft and I definitely saw him put a condom on then. He was really bad at communication and moved fast, all he said was ‚Äúwanna fuck?‚Äù but I‚Äôm neurodivergent + have anxiety so I just went with it. I did want to hook up, but I wanted to discuss things first like boundaries, any hard no‚Äôs etc and I didn‚Äôt get the chance to. I would never agree to have sex without a condom and he moved too fast for me to express that, but I thought it was fine because he automatically put one on when we had tried before and as soon as he asked to have sex this time, he got up, got what I presumed to be a condom from his coat stood with his back to me, looked like he was putting one on. It was dark in my room so I didn‚Äôt really get a clear look at his parts, but it very much looked like he put one on. 

Eventually he slowed down and stopped, and I thought that he might have come, then he asked to switch positions but before we started again he changed his mind and asked to take a break so we were done. After he left, I realized there wasn‚Äôt a condom in my trash. The one closest to my bed didn‚Äôt have a bag in it so I understand why he might not have put it in that one but there were 2 other trash cans in my room he could‚Äôve put it in, and its not in ANY of them. So now I‚Äôm freaking out. I am on birth control so not so much worried about pregnancy but STI‚Äôs/STD‚Äôs. Also just generally feeling icky and a lil violated even tho it‚Äôs my fault I didn‚Äôt communicate my boundaries. I don‚Äôt think he came in me though, so either he did use a condom or he didn‚Äôt come at all. He was an incredibly awkward dude, so honestly I‚Äôm just hoping that he didn‚Äôt come, didn‚Äôt notice the other trash cans in my room so just took the condom with him?? 

Im trying not to freak out because either way I intended on getting tested after, now I just feel more urgency. One friend tells me to just text him and ask, but that feels so horrifically embarrassing, another says don‚Äôt bother and just get tested when I can. I do have class with him twice a week for the next 2 weeks so I don‚Äôt want to do anything that‚Äôs gonna make me feel like I want to throw up from embarrassment the next time I see him. I mean it it is plausible he took the condom with him right??üò≠ Ever since last night when I realized there wasn‚Äôt one in the trash I feel like I‚Äôve almost been dissociating or something. Like if he actually didn‚Äôt put one on, I definitely feel like he pretended to which disturbs me. I‚Äôm just really upset.

Update- thank you all so much for the kind comments and reassurance. I'm still processing the news but feel more comforted knowing that I'm not crazy to feel this way. 

-----
I just found out that a former colleague killed himself and I'm stunned. 

On the surface, he had so much going for him. He was successful, from a very wealthy family, went to all the right schools, attractive, had a good group of friends etc etc. Some colleagues trash talked him for his ""privileges"".

To me, he was always kind, supportive, generous, humble and helpful. He seldom looked me the eye though and there was a kind of darkness around his eyes, even when he smiled. People said that he drank a lot and did coke.

I was very pleasant to him and always very supportive/appreciative.  I did keep a slight distance from him because i felt a bit awkward around him. The people who trash talked him were my close friends and also, i felt a bit odd around him because he was so attractive and i didn't want it to be awkward. Before i got to know him, i thought that he might be arrogant... But he wasn't. At all. 

About a year ago, i found out that he came down with some mysterious but non serious illness. I wanted to message him - just some well wishes. But my colleague friend who didn't like him told me not to. She said it would be silly to message him for something so small. 

I should have listened to myself. I had my own relationship with him anyways. 

I feel sad. I feel bad for not having sensed that something serious was going on with him. Apparently he had depression for years. I feel bad for.. I'm not sure. I never new anyone who committed suicide before. Maybe I'm being rediculous for feeling so sad about a person i wasn't super close to.

pgzszh,TwoXSupport,1630651427.0,"I‚Äôve had a horrid week. On Saturday, I was in the ER after enduring cyclic vomiting for four hours with it not letting up and having nausea days before. They never found what was wrong with me. Eventually, 12 hours after I started, most of the nausea went away. There‚Äôs a compelling argument to be made that this was cannabis-induced due to a combination of stress, constantly vaping every 15 minutes, and ordering the highest concentrations on the market. Why am I stressed? I'm stuck at home with a dying transphobic father and a mother who is distraught over losing her husband piece by piece daily.I feel burned out in my job and so disconnected. Nobody would notice if I up and got hit by a bus except maybe two weeks later. I feel tired every day, somewhere, somehow I'm going to be involuntarily reminded of the misogyny, the transphobia,. I don't have to seek it - it comes to me.

I‚Äôm cold turkey on weed since Saturday obviously. I don't ever want to go through that again. It was one of the worst experiences in my life.

I still have insomnia. I feel very fragile.

And I‚Äôve been slowly trying to get my diet back together but recovering from this is hard.

Before I fell asleep last night, I practically prayed to stop feeling incredibly upset from the Texas abortion bullshit news. I need to sleep. This anger hurts me inside. Maybe I'll feel better in the morning.

I wake up and ... it‚Äôs worse than I imagined. The Supreme Court approved of it. And as the shitcherries on top go, Virginia and North Carolina Supreme Courts both asserted the right for Christian teachers to misgender/harass their transgender pupils. Because ""Free Speech"" and religion. I am so mad. So fucking mad. I can‚Äôt move. It's 7am and every muscle in my body is starting to turn against its neighbor. I stay in bed. I can‚Äôt move.

But there are a few things that can get me out of a despair funk, right? I know - my GCS pre-op appointment! The drive was an hour and difficult but I got there on time. I reviewed in my head what I was going to say. All I wanted a month delay so my electrologist could clear the peritoneal area (and allow for redundant appointments in case we have to skip a few).  Everything else was okayed by the surgeon. So yes, we‚Äôre in the last stretch, right? I was certain that would work.

But... I made a terrible mistake. I brought up the ER visit on Saturday.

Long story short, my surgical date is now bumped off three months (it was supposed to happen in 8 days) to November 30th.

All I wanted was a month. The cyclic vomiting aftermath would normalize in a few weeks as my body purges out the remaining marijuana.

Three months. Three more months to wait for an incredibly arduous surgery that also takes 3-6 months to heal. Good bye year. Good bye progress.

I set myself back. Three. Months.

I've looked forwards to this for months. The bottom dysphoria was getting worse but my conviction was carrying me to my surgical date.

I don't know what to believe any more.

Ever since I got home, I‚Äôve been crying in bed since. I hate my body. I hate my life. I‚Äôd kill myself but unfortunately for me, I‚Äôve long conditioned myself to become inactive/sedentary when I‚Äôm angry or upset (which stops me from taking any action, including self-lethal ones). I am stuck. This planet is hell. I wish I never conditioned myself to become helpless. I don‚Äôt even know why I bother - things will just always get worse. My dad‚Äôs still dying slowly  - 1/3 of his chest is now assimilated into the sarcoma. I‚Äôm still burnt out from the damn pandemic. I have compassion fatigue - I feel numb. I can only do so much gardening before there‚Äôs nothing else to do but wait. I don‚Äôt want to eat. I‚Äôve only had gatorade and a single Marie Callendar‚Äôs Ravioli bowl today. Yes, that‚Äôs the grand sum of my sustenance for the whole 24 hour period. 

I honestly wish I had never been born. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever heal even remotely close to half way to undo the mental damage I have. I don‚Äôt trust people. And I can never act on my anger - the universe has literally conspired to have my actions on my anger always harm just me. So all I can do... is nothing. Just lay in bed, hoping maybe an aneurysm will do what my mind cannot. Catharsis will never come. And even when it does, I know that I will truly regret it shortly and bitterly. 

I don‚Äôt think any of my traumatic triggers will ever be removed. I‚Äôm broken. I‚Äôm never going to make friends. And I‚Äôm not certain if I really have friends to begin with, because it involves me usually doing the chasing else nothing happens. I hate that. But more than that, I hate myself because that‚Äôs the person who is responsible for this shit. That‚Äôs the person who keeps me anchored to planet Hell. Me.

I was happy to provide her support and take the expected place.

Until 2020,where a sequence of events led to me deciding to re appear in a set of exams in which I had done marginally worse than her. She pretty much discouraged me to retake them,though I had firmly said that I intend to reappear in 2021. Initially I was heartbroken that she didn't have faith in my capabilities. However as I traced back my memories, it really felt like she was sabotaging me. She self-admitted that she lies about being unprepared for exams to put people off track;I had been warned about this by mutual who knew her before.I had stayed up during odd hours for our school end graduation exams(extremely important in our country),genuinely believing her hysteria.

Add to that she is extremely dependent and I feel like an emotional sponge. She takes reckless decisions and almost always comes back to me after messing up. Yet she cannot take responsibility for her actions.(Eg She gave head to her bf without knowing that condoms are required and why)

I want to break the friendship but don't know how. I am extremely non confrontational. Also I am currently heading towards said exams which she had belittled me for wanting to apply. I simply do not have in me to engage with her. She texts me all the time,calls up my sister if I don't respond. I can't have my abusive parents know about the possibility of any tensions.

I am 19 now and finally getting my dream come true... rhinoplasty. People that are close to me always tell me that my nose is fine, there is nothing wrong about it. But also my best friend sometimes makes jokes about my nose in front of other people and i kinda laugh it off at that moment but i think it hurts me a little. Also my breasts are relatively small to my body. She sometimes jokes about them too, even in front of male friends. I kindly told her to stop that and she did. She is also very insecure about her body because she thinks she is fat but she definitely is not. She recently told me i was constantly bragging about my minor imperfections and she was having it harder. I dont know why she has to be jealous of my body and at the same time jokingly insult it in front of everyone.(I went a bit off topic here) 
I am dreaming of that day, my nose will be perfect. But then i think about how my face is very asymmetrical, my upper lip is kinda thin, i have a very flat waist that gives me 0 curves (i have to mention i am on the slimmer side, but with a flat chest and narrow hips, my waist looks chunky even though i am almost skinny.) My waist has a 67-68cm of perimeter but i always idealised a waist of 60cms. 
How can i stop always finding flaws and fixating on them? After i get my rhinoplasty, im afraid i wont stop there and get lip fillers or something. I want to keep my natural self.

o5qj61,TwoXSupport,1624377760.0,"I'm on birth control and in a committed relationship that is sexually active, perhaps ""very"" active to some (multiple boinks per week is the norm). We don't use condoms regularly, in part because the brand we like isn't the cheapest and it'd create a lot of waste. This creates the problem of my vaginal pH getting fucked up and the wonderful smell that comes with that. I know boric acid supplements work wonders, but I hate putting them in and HATE having the contents of the capsules leaking out of me all day long. Part of why I take BC in the first place is to not have periods and not have to use pads, so constantly using these supplements kind of defeats that purpose. However, its the only alternative to condoms for preventing that dead-sperm pussy smell. Should we just stock up on condoms and get over our mental block about avoiding creating extra landfill waste? Maybe we could get the lambskin ones (although who knows if they're still biodegradable after whatever chemical treatment they undergo), although sizing and price may be an issue. Of course there's no such thing as a dick too big to for a condom, but there is such thing as a condom that is uncomfortably tight around that rubber-ring base part. Or maybe smaller boric acid capsules wouldn't leak out as much? 

**Does anyone have any suggestions for controlling vaginal pH outside of boric acid supplements and condoms?** Maybe there are some probotics would help? (not sure if they make safe probiotics as vaginal suppositories that might be more effective than ones taken orally, but I imagine those would be leaky as well). I figured this problem is natural side effect of high pH semen raising the pH of whats supposed to be a low pH environment, and our sexual activity is too frequent for my body to bring things back down to a basic pH (I've had this problem briefly before with a past partner). However I never hear anyone talking about copius-sex-pussy-stank, so I don't know if its a medical problem on my end.

&#x200B;

Second question is also regarding something not commonly discussed, and there's even less information on the internet about it. Unless I've recently showered, my areolas leave an awful taste in my partners' mouth. I can also taste it when I kiss him, its very bitter and kind of like earwax but not as bad. I've tried changing bodywashes to no avail, so it must be something about my biology. He did once come across a reddit threat where a man and his gf were having a similar problem, and someone said it was some sort of protective wax that the area secretes, but didn't offer a solution or much more information than that. How come there's no other info about this though?? Is this like, a rare condition, or a normal function of AFAB tits?! His nipples do not have that flavor of course, but I don't know if its a woman-thing or just a me-thing. I don't eat much processed food (aside from non-American chocolate) and no fast food, so I don't imagine my diet is the problem. The only thing I can think of that might've contributed to it is that I used to put tape (yes, TAPE, electrical tape to be specific) over my nipples as a teen because I was too flat for bras and had no way to prevent my nipples from being visible over my shirt. When I'd take the tape off at the end of the day, my nipples were of course sweaty but there was also an awful smell I'd describe as smelling like taco bell. If you use anti-perspirant and have ever squeezed a pore on your armpit the stuff that comes out has a similar smell too. I guess I wasnt smart enough to think to use bandaids or couldnt find any in the house. Maybe this damaged my areolas or led them to overproduce whatever bad-tasting secretion is on them.

o2ok0b,TwoXSupport,1624021207.0,"Hi there, I just discovered this subreddit - thank you so much for existing! I lurk in some other mental health subreddits and I feel like there is not a lot of room/interest in talking about female specific issues. I am so happy to have found you all - I hope more women join us too!

I thought I would post some advice incase it helps anyone. My entire life I suffered severe anxiety and also periods of depression. I tried everything to get better but nothing worked. I spent years suffering. Finally, through luck or some divine intervention, I found a therapist who changed my life. It turns out that my anxiety was actually CPTSD and she was able to help me get it under control. 

Here is my advice for finding a therapist if this is something you are interested in! (Note: I understand not everyone is interested or ready for talk therapy; other types of therapy, like EMDR, may be worth a shot)

Unfortunately, my experience with therapy was incredibly challenging and took many years. I saw over a half dozen people until I found ‚Äòthe one‚Äô (and they don‚Äôt take insurance, unfortunately). Finding a therapist is a little bit like dating, it takes a few tries, but I hope some of this advice saves you some time. Most importantly, I recommend looking for someone who is trauma informed, even if you don‚Äôt think your issues are related to trauma. Other types of therapy (like CBT) did not work for me and trauma informed providers seem to have the latest training and thinking in the field. 

I preferred someone of the same gender and whose website mentioned issues I was specifically interested in discussing (for me, it was pregnancy). I also read reviews of the practice and did an introductory phone call before committing. If you are having a hard time deciding, I would suggest interviewing a few; [here is a good link](http://gretchenschmelzer.com/blog-1/2014/10/27/no-one-heals-alone-finding-a-therapist#:%7E:text=How%20do%20I,different%20for%20everyone.%C2%A0) with questions you can ask. Before I knew what to look for, the therapists I saw ranged from ‚Äòmeh‚Äô to downright re-traumatizing. The therapist you choose should make you feel good, safe, listened to and supported. 

[Helpful website to find a therapist
](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)

USA Specific advice: If you have tried a few people in your insurance network and not had much luck, I suggest being open to trying an out of network therapist. I have found that they are higher quality. Unfortunately, they are incredibly expensive and I understand that not everyone can afford this. For me, it was worth it to make budget cuts in other areas of my life to make it happen. If you interview them, ask if they can work with you on a sliding scale.

14nx88x,TwoXSupport,1688223679.0,"Context: 
My boyfriend and I (both late 20s) were recently talking and he was talking about an older customer who had a crush on him. 

I‚Äôm older than my partner by a couple years and it‚Äôs something we‚Äôll make jokes about regularly. I said ‚ÄúA lot of older girls are attracted to you!‚Äù This was me starting to try to flirt with him, as I really was the older girl in question I was talking about. (I didn‚Äôt really think this was insensitive but you can let me know if you think it is).

He then proceeds to say ‚ÄúI attract a lot of women.‚Äù I then immediately lost interest in the rest of our conversation, and I can‚Äôt really recall the rest of what we talked about. 

I asked him why he said that the other day because it just felt so mean. He told me that he had felt I was insulting his attractiveness by saying that only older women were attracted to him, and younger women weren‚Äôt- and that I felt I wouldn‚Äôt have anything to worry about since it was only older women and he wanted to reiterate that a lot of women are attracted to him. He apologized for being mean. 

However I feel like this is sending warning bells in my mind. I thought he had essentially just said something without thinking about it, but it‚Äôs clear to me there was intent. 

I feel like to him, I had insulted him/hurt his pride so I needed to be put in my place.

This type of thinking is very alarming to me, and I need some good follow up questions to help me determine if this is a one-off or if this is going to be an ongoing issue. If it is the latter, things will be reconsidered. It is very important to me that my partner respects me, and if he has a consistent mindset of needing to make sure I‚Äôm put in my place, I don‚Äôt think he respects me.

(I have had some issues with the way he takes about women flirting with him before, just never said anything. It felt like he really prided himself on being attractive to other women and liked the attention and I feel like I‚Äôve just been proven right, but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting.)

Hi,

I never thought I would be posting in this group. The other day, just a few days after meeting his entire family and friends (he is from another country), my boyfriend broke up with me. I took this trip with him to get to know his family and his country, and was starting to consider what life would be like there. He didn't give me a real reason for the break up, but just said he didn't see our relationship going anywhere, and had started feeling that way before the trip and was just hoping it would go away. I was completely blindsided - everything seemed relatively normal, and we were still cuddling, kissing, and seeing each other every day.

I am absolutely devastated. This is the first time I've ever loved someone and would really have been willing to make sacrifices for them. He said it wasn't my fault, and it wasn't something I had done, and it's him not me (what does that even mean?) - but I just feel completely unlovable - if that's the case, then why did he break up with me? I didn't even get a chance to try and figure things out with him and see if we could make a resolution. I can't help but hope that maybe he will realize he made a mistake and want to get back together.

As we all know, whether by lived experience or vicariously that domestic and sexual abuse happens all too often.

Aerie - not meant for fat butts. They either create wedgies, or the gusset is too short, or the gusset width is too narrow. I got one of each design/style when on sale and I had to throw out almost all of them. Only the sunnie boyshort style is tolerable but the gusset length is too short.

Meundies - somewhat meant for big butts. All the styles are ridiculously comfortable but the gusset is too short.

Soma - the vanishing edge hipster and briefs were comfy but have a short gusset. Only the boyshorts fit all the criteria. Unfortunately this is fancy underwear so I wear it only when going out.

Thunderpants - so far top of the list. They're comfy and fit great but the gusset is again too short which is a huge bummer. Side note, their leggings are great.

Duluth - a mixed bag. All of them have the short gusset issue but are comfy. This is the second on the list because even though the gusset is short it's not too short.

My Best Fitting Panty from Walmart - great because they have no gusset. The whole underwear is one piece with no extra lining at the crotch. The downside is that larger sizes are rarely available and sell out quickly.


That's it so far and if anyone has any other brand recommendations please let me know. I'll add any more info I remember as edits to the post.

Edit 1: 01 Dec - the Duluth sneeze guard underwear is great for period time. The gusset is long and pads stick to it.

Edit 2: 08 Dec - I tried all of the Fruit of the Loom hipster styles and none fit well. It's as though women's underwear is not designed by women at all... Honorary mention goes to the beyond stripes variety hipster because even though it has gusset issues the rest of it is fantastic.

Edit 3: 16 Dec - none of the Victoria's Secret hip huggers undies have the features I'm looking for. Not just that, they really don't seem to be made for big butts even though the sides go to XL. ü•≤

Edit 4: 31 Dec - I tried Huha brand bikini underwear and the gusset is really long which is fantastic. But the underwear is more like a cheeky kind causing constant  wedgies. Reviews for their brief style underwear also mention not having full coverage. I think at this point I'm just gonna give up...

I love him deeply and am happy with most aspects of our relationship. There is a big one that has been a strain on our relationship for years now. He started his own business and has not kept up with taxes, not because he doesn't want to, but because he is overwhelmed. I have tried to remain sympathetic (he has ADD and really feels paralyzed about this) but it is weighing on me. I have tried to help him but cannot and will not do this for him, and have expressed how much this bothers me that he has not taken care of it. 

I am planning on telling him that if he has not began the filling process by tax day of next year (April 2024) then we will have to have a serious discussion about the future of our relationship. My plan is to move out so that our finances will be separated entirely. I do not want to present an ultimatum, but every time I've brought up how serious it is, he gets into action enough to release a little of the steam, but has not made serious effort to get it resolved.

11q4l00,TwoXSupport,1678698088.0,"Hi everyone,

I have always had an irregular/long period with a 6 to 8 week cycle. Also due to acne problems, I started using the pill (Levonorgestrel (0.15 mg)/Ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg)) about two years ago.

About half a year in, I started bleeding heavily for a week within the middle of the strip. And that happened every 6 weeks. So it was just like I still got my own period when on the pill, since the bleeding always comes around every 6 weeks and the bleeding/cramps were just like a normal period. But since I was on the pill, I also got a withdrawal bleeding every 3 weeks because of the pill-free week.

I became very tired of bleeding every few weeks, so now I continuously take the pill until I get my own period. What is interesting, is that my cycle length gradually shortened from around 6 weeks to now a steady 4 weeks in a few months.

Does anyone have a similar experience? Or does anyone know what can cause this? My doctor namely does not know, or she does not really care, since she just put it aside as spotting and suggested a higher-dose birth control pill.

lhpq6c,TwoXSupport,1613064576.0,"We broke up Sunday night and since then I grieved that night, sporadically Monday, and have been trying to push through it in order to seem okay (unhealthy I know but I‚Äôve got bigger fish to fry at the moment). 

When we started, we were really great together, but things started shifting when we moved long distance after a year of dating (his family had to move across the country and he couldn‚Äôt afford to stay here by himself or with reliable friends). We broke up the first time because he felt that he couldn‚Äôt offer me the same type of love and care that I deserve and that there was a sort of disconnect for him. I understood (even though it hurt a ton) and we parted ways as friends. 

Fast forward to this past summer we got back together after talking and working out what went wrong the first time amidst the pandemic. It started off great again, but this past Sunday he broke up with me again. Same reasoning. However, he said something that made me concerned. He mentioned that even though he thought of me constantly and would prefer to talk to me pretty much all the time, he didn‚Äôt feel the drive to (which he admitted was dumb since he literally could pick up his phone to do so).

I do not blame him whatsoever for either of the breakups. I have no anger for him. I even told him so and to not blame himself for this. Our circumstances were to blame and that had we been together in person this probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened seeing as everything shifted soon after we became long distance. A few friends (one being a mutual friend of ours. how we met each other) suspect that he has undiagnosed depression and that he needs to see someone. Of course we can‚Äôt officially say it but they all have varying forms of depression and recognize the symptoms. I guess if it helps, his love language is Touch and mine is Quality Time so kinda hard when we‚Äôre on opposite sides of the country during a pandemic. 

The reason why I‚Äôm bringing this up is that my sister (who knows nothing about our relationship dynamic because I hate how nosy she is. My brother is the one who told her we broke up. Not me.) asked me why did we break up and that he was a douchebag and that he wasn‚Äôt worth getting back together with because he‚Äôs a horrible person. I disagree of course because she knows virtually nothing about him and she said the exact same thing the first time (again, heard through someone else. not me). 

However, where he lives now with his family is where I have dreamed of working/living for a long time. He knows that as well. What I‚Äôm wondering is if it is worth it to pursue a friendship with him when I settle there in the near future. Should I? I mean he‚Äôs quite literally one of the best people to enter into my life. He‚Äôs given me a lot to cherish and he‚Äôs an amazing friend if we take out the romantic relationship part.  

One friend has already stated that I should give him time (which I am) and that I probably shouldn‚Äôt contact him at all until after I‚Äôve settled down with the job and place there. My goal is at least try to move there before the end of summer so I‚Äôm kinda just running through all the scenarios and could use some friendly advice",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/lhpq6c/bf_broke_up_with_me_again_for_the_same_reason/,BF broke up with me again for the same reason (suspected depression),Support - Advice Welcome,9,3,0.85,usagi-reina

16ne5ki,TwoXSupport,1695191873.0,"Hi,

&#x200B;

I would like to give a little background about my life.

&#x200B;

I have always been extremely introverted with social anxiety, and i've grown up in a toxic joint family where no one showed affection for each other and everyone would bitch, complain and hate on their own family members. \[ families of my father, my two uncles and my grandparents all under the same roof\]

I , as a result, am wired the same way but i have always maintained distance and refused to engage in the negative behaviors. None of my family members ever showed any affection towards me and no one was interested in my existence.

So, I've spent most of my life alone not talking to the very people i live with leading to no social skills or ability to show affection.

I've always managed to have good genuine friends in school and college though.

Now fast forward 25 years, I have an amazing husband who loves me a lot, he understands me and accepts me even though I come across as a frigid bitch to the rest of the world.

We dated for five years before getting married. He comes from a very close family, quite the opposite of mine. His parents have loved and nurtured him and his younger sister unconditionally, boosting their confidence and also spoiling them to an extent.

Now after marriage I am unable to show affection towards them and I don't call them often.

But I don't call anyone in my life often, including my parents.

I lived with them for a few months immediately after my marriage and I found myself getting annoyed by a lot things I could have taken lightly.

&#x200B;

A few of them are :

1) My FIL is obsessed with his daughter, my SIL. I understand all dads love their daughters, but my FIL continuously goes ""my baby"" ""my baby"" all day long to his 24 yo daughter and praises her every second of the day which irritates me.

I get it, she is your daughter. I get it she is amazing, and you are proud of her. But do you have to keep saying it out loud abnormally 100 times every day. I mean what is the purpose of that?

As a result of this behavior his daughter had turned into an absolute princess with no friends, because no one is going to treat her like a princess except him. And that is what she expects from the outer world, even me and my husbad, and explicitly demands for it, and more often than not people tell her to fuck off.

Don't get me wrong, I don't want affection from my FIL, especially to that extent.

But I don't understand why someone would behave in this manner. I might have no right to be offended by this, but I get extremely irritated and offended and sometimes it's difficult to not let it show on my face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2) They call my husband every single day and get mad if we don't call them once a week at least.

I understand this is not an unreasonable thing to ask for, we should indeed be calling them once or twice a week. and they are really nice so there is no reason to not call them.

But me being extremely antisocial and introverted, Even calling them once a week is a task for me and I don't do it. I know it makes them dislike me, and being aware of this fact makes me hate them in return.

It seems, I have to demonize them no matter what.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3) I hate getting any advice from them. and they love giving advice.

I had to be independent very early on in my life, and I worked very hard to become an independent adult, I earn well, and I want nothing from them.

It's human nature to overlook 100 things that I might do right and have put effort in, and point out the one thing that did not go right.

My SIL, inspite of being younger with less experience, keeps giving advice and commenting on our home and our life without having any experience to warrant such advice.

I get really pissed.

&#x200B;

4) I secretly overheard my FIL's sister telling him over the phone how I am okay but not up to standard with other DIL's of the family. My FIL did not say anything to support her statement, but her comment still hurt. It reinforced my feeling of not being good enough. I am inface not loving and warm like other DIL's, I can't cook, socialize and entertain like them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I guess i just want to keep my husband to myself and have an otherwise secluded life. Which is not possible.

I have tried to be rational and not hate my in laws .

I guess the problem might be me, but this is causing me a lot of bitterness an unhappiness.

Any advice from fellow married women will be appreciated :)

14glrbh,TwoXSupport,1687485482.0,"I‚Äôm having a hard time distinguishing what I‚Äôm feeling and if I genuinely have a crush or if I‚Äôm feeling the loneliness from a semi recent breakup. 

To preface - my long term relationship ended sort of recently, just over a month ago, but I had been planning and organizing the break up for around a year. It was escalating dangerously close to domestic violence, so I just needed time to save up and make a safe exit. I did feel a little sad about the end, as it was someone I spent a good chunk of time with, but I‚Äôm happier out of the relationship. 

About a year and a half ago I met someone at a work event who very quickly became my closest and best friend, and since my breakup he has been close to the only thing keeping me sane. I‚Äôll refer to him as Will for the rest of this.  
I want to make it clear that during my relationship it was strictly platonic - I never looked at Will as anything more than my friend, and I can only assume that he looked at me the same way. 

Since the break up we have been spending more and more time together, often just meeting up to run errands together, going on hikes during the weekend, and we spend hours on the phone talking - sometimes in group calls with his other friends. Very recently I find myself jumping up every time I hear my phone ping, excited for a text from him - staying up late just to continue talking, and our talks have become a lot more intimate. Not really breaching the line into feelings confessionals, but he will often say very sentimental things about how much he values our connection, and how happy he is that we are close. During our hikes we walk pretty close, shoulders brushing up and he often pulls leaves and debris out of my hair.

Will does a lot for me, some things that even my closest girl friends wouldn‚Äôt offer. He has offered to drive out to my work and pick me up when I finish, even though it‚Äôs close to a two hour round trip for him. He drives me to my errands for my hobbies that don‚Äôt really interest him, but he just says he likes spending time with me and doesn‚Äôt mind. Again - this is all a fairly new development in our friendship but I‚Äôm just completely giddy at any chance to spend time with or talk to Will. 

I know it‚Äôs much too soon to get into a new relationship, and during our deep talks together I have told Will that. He agrees with me when I say I have a lot of healing to do, and he‚Äôs supportive and gentle with me. I‚Äôm not even really sure if I want to be in a new relationship at the moment, but I can‚Äôt help to question my feelings. The crazy thing is he is NOT my ‚Äútype‚Äù, physically - the kind of person I would normally drool over. But when we‚Äôre together I have a blast. When I get home my cheeks are usually hurting because I‚Äôve been smiling and laughing so much. My heart races while I wait for him to pick me up. He is the kindest, most considerate and emotionally mature man I have ever met. 

Am I crazy? Am I just lonely because I let go of my relationship so long ago, even though I just recently left it? Our friendship is very much not a normal friendship, it‚Äôs a lot more intimate than, again, even my closest girl friends. I love spending time with Will and clearly he enjoys spending it with me as well. 
Am I looking too deeply into things? Should I just let things flow and see where it takes me, or talk to him about these strange feelings?

w761uc,TwoXSupport,1658697043.0,"Hello! So I finally got my Mirena inserted Friday before last. Pretty easy appointment and I worked myself up over a 5 minute thing. I ended up getting my period the next day so that was an interesting weekend for me. 

HOWEVER, it's been about 9 days now of being on my period and I'm starting to get a little anxious. I'm not bleeding heavily (in fact it's less than normal), but my period is normally 6-7 days so this is weird for me. Even then, days 6 and 7 are just annoying spots throughout the day so I could get away with just liner instead of a proper pad. Also there's a dull ache in my right pelvis so no clue if that's related or my joints are catching up to me from biking. 

I just talked to a Nurse Advice Line that my insurance has and they were super nice but weren't much help on telling me if this was normal. All they said was to call my PCP and talk to them about it.

I'm wondering if any of you experienced something similar to me and I'm just working myself up over a thing that'll clear up this week

Update: So I def mixed up my period and IUD spotting. My period did last 7 days (per usual) but spotting was def the most annoying thing. Finally got it down to where I can get away with a smaller liner. Still annoying but hey, body is still adjusting I guess.

mbpv56,TwoXSupport,1616536444.0,"This is long, have a TLDR: Boyfriend got close to but didn't necessarily break a boundary I have about drinking, do I keep the boundary and lose the boyfriend if he crosses it or is my boundary too strict?

I've got a pretty heavy history in the relationship department (thankfully nothing physical, but plenty of terrible decisions and nonexistent boundaries) so I took some time after ending the last one to work on me, know where my boundaries are, how to enforce them...trying to set myself up to be as successful as possible with the next boy I decided to grace with myself. I think I'm there, but obviously it's a struggle with my past self and getting out of those behaviors. 

So we're over 4 months in and things are going okay, especially for a new relationship where everything's rosy and we're both putting forth our best selves anyway. I've communicated with him if I feel smothered (it's easy to smother me and I've usually just gone out of my way to be available and accommodating so this is Big Deal Progress for me), any of his behaviors I've had issue with, and tried to clearly outline where my limits are on alcohol. Don't get me wrong on that last one, I have no issue with the occasional drink, but I've had a few drunks in my life and I don't want to repeat that experience so it's really important to me to be with someone who **doesn't** drink daily or even so much, so often that the conversation is regularly highlighted with comments like ""Sorry, I'm drunk"" or ""Getting tipsy"" or ""*something, something*. Oh, I wouldn't have said that if I weren't so drunk.""

The **Thing** is, apparently, he does drink a lot sometimes. I knew that he could have because when I first laid out that boundary he had a lot of follow up questions about where, specifically, the line was. Don't @ me with your red flags, I feel comfortable stating that he was feeling out where my line was so he could understand it clearly and I made him tell me how often he was drinking before I told him my line. Yes, yellow flag, but not a solid red yet. A couple of weeks ago I noticed a pattern in our conversation of phrases about him drinking coming up more often than not on a daily basis. I waited a week before saying anything, because a few days could be aberrant but a week is an established pattern in my mind, and it became A Big Deal. There was a lot of back and forth (texting), with him immediately coming out and agreeing that he had been drinking a lot that week, and drinking for the sake of drinking rather than because he was celebrating or drinking away a bad day or something, putting himself down for it. I called off a sleepover because he was angry at himself and, definitely, drunk angry boys are the reason I won't tolerate regular drinkers. He apologized for many days about his outburst and general behavior and told me that he had fallen back into old ways but wouldn't make that mistake again because he didn't want to be one of those guys that had made me establish the drinking boundary. 

Moving on to regular conversations between us and it comes up that he used to be a full blown alcoholic. I have no problem with recovered addicts. I have respect and grace for them personally, but romantically? I'm a single parent. I am absolutely responsible for showing my daughter healthy relationships. I realize this could make me a terrible person but I don't want to be hitching our wagon to someone that's potentially unstable.

So now, we're at **The Dilemma**. 

Addicts can slip. Addicts can recover for years and then slip. Addicts can recover completely for the rest of their lives. He wasn't drinking every day. He wasn't drinking so much that he was blacking out. He wasn't drinking so much he was even impaired for that long. \*TW: Self Harm\* BUT, he used to. He used to drink so much he's been hospitalized multiple times for it. He has a history of self harm related to drinking. He only hasn't been doing that for the last year or so. Which is not a long time and genuinely scares me how close he is to that. We've continued to talk about this and he's actually said the phrase to me, ""I'm going to mess up again, and I need to know if you can forgive me."" and I didn't know how to respond. People make mistakes, but this just seems to be one that I can't forgive with my drinking boundary, right? I'm willing (and glad) to be with him now and in future, but I don't think I can forgive excessive drinking again. I wouldn't even call this time around excessive since we'd talked about where my boundary was but it's not like he'd gotten close to it or I could have definitely not communicated that line as clearly as I should have. It seems so stupid to have this incredibly restrictive boundary, but when I reflect on it I don't think it's that restrictive. 

Help. Creating boundaries is hard. Enforcing them is hard. I know we're all allowed to have whatever limits we want, but it would be so nice to get some kind of affirmation that mine's okay or some guidance on what's wrong with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSupport/comments/mbpv56/new_boyfriend_trying_to_be_healthy_this_time/,New boyfriend - Trying to be healthy this time around *TW: Self Harm*,Support - Advice Welcome,4,4,0.84,campbell317704

1d7nhmb,WomenHealthTreatments,1717471491.0,"Hello everyone.
 First of all I would like to say that have and am currently seeking medical advice. I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should consider bringing up to my health care provider.

During covid I had a family illness and then death, so my periods weren't as consistent as they usually were from stress. But it's been over 2 years now since the death, and one since moving to a new home. I think that my uterus/hormones should be back on track at this point. Also I've been consistently fatigued, but that's not a recent thing. I'm sure the spotting isn't helping. There is also no pain with the spotting. My only pain so far has been from the few periods I've has.

For over 4 months now I've had daily spotting, that ranges from slightly pink to brown. Also it's sometimes quite light to the tail end of a period in heaviness. I've had 2 periods during that time, with no break in the spotting. 

My nurse practitioner did a pap smear to check for polyps. That came back clean as a whistle, which is nice because my mother had to get some polyps removed so I was a bit concerned.

I've had my blood tested for hormone levels, which came back normal
My iron levels were a little low, so I've been on a prescribed supplement. Thankfully my stomach  isn't responding poorly to it, but I'm not noticing an increase in energy. I've also been taking vit. D daily. As well as having something with citrus alongside the tablet.

I've also had a transvaginal and pelvic ultrasound a few days ago. The nurse practitioner left a message today to say that everything looked normal. This is good because I have a family history of fibroid, ovarian cysts, and atheist 3 generations of women on my moms side with endometriosis. I know endometriosis isn't necessary going to show up on ultrasound, but I figured they might have noticed If there was scarring or weird growths in the uterus.

Overall my concerns are being taken seriously. My nurse practitioner is great, she did my fist pap smear (the one mentioned earlier) and was super nice and talked me through everything with out being condescending. The woman who did my ultrasound was super nice too, she couldn't give any recommendation other than tell me what she was looking for (fibroid and cysts specifically). She was also really nice and made me feel comfortable as possible throughout the procedure. My mother as well, who also has had reproductive health issues (endo) is being supportive and encouraging me to keep looking for answers.

I'm so lucky and happy to have had support from my health Carr providers and family, I know so many women could only dream of someone taking them seriously. And I let them know too how happy I am with their care. 

If there's anything you recommend me talking over with the nurse, or asking the women in my family about, please let me know so I can bring it up at my next appointment.

I'm really struggling right now knowing how to move forward with a girl I started dating a few months ago. I had a really bad relationship when I was younger and didn't really date at all through most my 20s. It's been about 6 years since I even considered wanting to try being in a relationship with anyone. Then I met this current girl, and she seems great!

Researchers at Western Carolina University are inviting women, whether or not you have had past unwanted sexual experiences, to participate. This study investigates how past unwanted sexual experiences and discussions of those experiences with one‚Äôs romantic partner may be associated with women‚Äôs sex lives.

To participate, you must be:

¬∑  A woman

¬∑  18 years or older

¬∑  In a romantic relationship

¬∑  Have had sex with your partner in the past four weeks

The goal of this study is to better understand women‚Äôs sexual experiences in romantic relationships. You will be asked very personal questions about your sex life, personality, and romantic relationship. If you have had unwanted sexual experiences in your past, you will also be asked a few very brief questions about those experiences. 

This study will take approximately 15 minutes to complete

I‚Äôm a 25 y/o female. This has been going on for a little over a month. I won‚Äôt provide pictures of my breast. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô2, 194 pounds, non smoker, started indomethacin after symptoms started for headaches and I‚Äôm taking omeprazole. 
Backstory, I have not breastfed in a year and a half, I‚Äôm not on any birth control and I‚Äôve taken enough pregnancy tests and had my period so I know I‚Äôm not pregnant. 
A little over a month ago I noticed my left breast was a bit tender but thought maybe it was just my period coming. My period came and went and my left breast increased in pain, as well as getting swollen (especially around my nipple). I made a same day appointment over the phone and the dr thought it may be mastitis so I started some pretty strong antibiotics and got a breast ultrasound. There is no lumps so I was not worried or cancer. The antibiotics did not work and it continued to get worse as days go on. The breast ultrasound showed nothing abnormal at all, no signs of even an infection or producing milk again. 
After this I went to see my primary and she seemed very confused. She could see how swollen it is, it feels warm, and there is bright red blotchy spots close to the nipple as well as my whole nipple going red. My nipple looks flatter and has started dimpling in on the side. There is no lump at all indicating mastitis or a clogged duct. She is still insisting it‚Äôs a clogged duct even thought there is no blebs and antibiotics didn‚Äôt work and we are over a month later. 
I brought up inflammatory breast cancer and she said that the red blotching and bruising look wasn‚Äôt considered a rash and that since I had no nipple discharge it was very unlikely. She also said how unlikely the only other option of a somehow still clogged duct after taking every measure to get a possible clog out and antibiotics. She mentioned a mammogram and said it wouldn‚Äôt hurt to check but she would rather wait a few weeks to see if I can get the supposed clog out. When I pointed out that my breasts look and feel fuller and heavier but im obviously not producing milk she ignored me. She pretty much blew me off and told me to try to express it in the shower (which I actually have been doing as well as a warm compress, nipple cream and anything I could think of).

sn6m8r,WomenHealthTreatments,1644282252.0,"29 year old female. For several years I have experience weird symptoms that I have realized are all around the time I am about to get my period. Thigh rash, hand eczema (tiny bumps), swollen tongue, extreme fatigue, out of breath, feeling like I am not getting enough oxygen, bruising. About 2.5 weeks ago I talked to my OBGYN about these issues because I had to leave work because both of my legs felt like a hundred pounds and I would start breathing heavily in a workplace where I wear a mask and wasn't feeling like I was able to. She wanted me to get a progesterone allergy test. She can't even recommend anyone specific to do it. I've called several places and talked to my insurance but no one seems to do this type of test.

I am currently mid cycle in the ""luteal phase"" and for 4 days I have been having heart palpitations. Palpitations that last for 10 minutes to hours on end. They aren't over and over again for hours on end but they come and go constantly during that time. It happened twice when I took a sip of a gin and tonic (right away I stopped drinking). I thought maybe it had to do with drinking. Then it happened again (worse) after I ate a small plate of crackers and cheese. It wasn't until last night when I realized I am mid cycle and looked up information. It seems like during this phase of a woman's cycle it is actually more normal to get heart palpitations.

I went to the doctor. My blood pressure was great and they did an ekg that they said looked perfectly fine. They decided to do two blood tests for anemia and thyroid. They also had me schedule an appointment to get a device to wear 24 hours to monitor my heart. However, they can't get me in until the 22nd of February.

I told my doctor about the allergy and hormones but they haven't even heard of it. I feel at a loss and like I am the only one who is going to figure this out for myself. Tonight the palpitations started again but they aren't as severe and I guess I am not as worried about them being an actual heart issue. I am trying to research and found that ""heart palpitations are a direct result of lower levels of the hormone estrogen."" Questions come to mind - are the heart palpitations happening because I am allergic to progesterone and they are now rising due to where I am in my cycle? Or are they rising because the estrogen is lowering while the progesterone is rising? Does it even matter which one?",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenHealthTreatments/comments/sn6m8r/hormone_imbalanceprogesterone_allergy/,Hormone Imbalance/Progesterone Allergy?,,1,0,1.0,jeanx4162

A lot of people still don‚Äôt seem to really know much about periods and I mean like granted I have definitely been one of those people until I started making peer-related posts, so I thought I would make this post just like out for educational purposes and also because a lot of you are like either girls.

My age or a little bit younger that are too afraid to talk about a period, and I want to let you know that you shouldn‚Äôt be afraid to talk about a period, and I feel like the more you know about it, the more you‚Äôre aware of it, the less afraid you‚Äôll be to talk about it so hopefully, this post does that.

I‚Äôm basically just going to tell you some facts some very weird ones some cool ones some oh wow ones about beers that you may not know and hopefully, you‚Äôll become more *period* confident.

So after get right into this post, you‚Äôll find so many peer-related posts in this article all about periods, so if you want to check that, or subscribe with us below to receive the latest posts about periods on your mail directly.

**Your** ***period*** **gets worse when it‚Äôs cold:**

Cold weather can actually impact your periods making them heavier and longer than usual.

During the winter months, a woman‚Äôs flow *period* duration and even pain level are longer than in the summer, this pattern also expands to those that live in colder climate areas than those in warmer temperatures.

**The average woman will experience a little bit over 400 periods in their lifetime:**

Between the average first woman‚Äôs *period* and menopause, you can expect about 450 visits from your monthly visitor talk about a little too much in my opinion but maybe that‚Äôs just me.

**You can go through up to 15 000** ***period*** **products in your lifetime:**

During those 450 periods, the average woman will go through about 12 000 and 15 000 pads tampons, and panty Liners which sounds like a lot and it is but on the bright side *period* panties and menstrual cups are a very eco-friendly option I feel like a lot of people don‚Äôt know this one.

Hello everyone, I have struggled with endometriosis for some time, which has inspired by passion for research and advocacy in this area of reproductive health. I am a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in the state of Florida, as well as a doctoral candidate in the PhD in Counselor Education program at the University of Central Florida.

I am currently in the dissertation phase of my education, and as a lifelong struggler with endometriosis, reproductive health is near to my heart. I truly feel that infertility is such an important topic that has not yet been fully understood in the counseling field, and I hope that this study can pave the way for more services specifically designed for individuals and couples who have experienced infertility.

I am looking for a large sum of **individuals and their partners** to participate (really focused on couple participants) by completed an **anonymous survey**. It's a short process (15-20 minutes), and for every survey completed, $1 is donated to your choice of ASRM, Fertility for Colored Girls, or Resolve.

I've got an appointment to see the gynecologist for another colposcopy (different PCP performed the PAP, and going to a different gynecologist). I found this out a little bit ago, but me going to the GYN got put on hold with corona blowing up.

Black Americans have attempted to have great wellbeing. Their very way of life incorporates rehearsing propensities that are not helpful for having great wellbeing. It is this way of life that is causing such a large number of to surrender to malady and sick - wellbeing. Seeing as what number of have been purchased up it is no big surprise great wellbeing isn't a need.

&#x200B;

I spent piece of my youth with my family members. Most were overweight, wanted to eat, and practiced pretty much nothing. I didn't think that its odd on the grounds that it appears to be a piece of the way of life. Furthermore, since such a large number of them could cook it was difficult to not eat and appreciate the taste. In different societies, there is a greater amount of an accentuation on eating well nourishments (like next to no red meat, loads of fish and vegetables). This isn't basic among dark families.

&#x200B;

There are numerous reasons dark Americans have customarily been presented to awful wellbeing propensities. Ordinarily their folks and grandparents were dependent upon poor dietary patterns. This caused certain wellbeing conditions to turn out to be increasingly obvious.

&#x200B;

1. Some blacks experienced childhood in the south where nourishment typically expended is loaded up with salt, fat, and things that will in general lead to worse hypertension. The nourishment is exceptionally prepared and extremely delectable.

&#x200B;

2) Obesity was the standard with sporadic exercise propensities. Eating was normal, building up an activity program was most certainly not. It is difficult to eat as such a large number of do with no activity and have great wellbeing.

&#x200B;

3) Poor exercise propensities - some gauge that 3% of dark Americans have a place with a gym. This helps represent why it is so basic for blacks to be in a bad way. This doesn't mean everybody is for there are some who acknowledge individual wellbeing. In any case, in general it is smarter to have more individuals exercise to work for better wellbeing.

&#x200B;

As indicated by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention blacks have:

&#x200B;

A) 13.8% who live in reasonable or unexpected frailty

&#x200B;

B) % of men more than 20 who are fat 37.5%, ladies - 56.1%

&#x200B;

C) % of men more than 20 with hypertension - 40.5%, ladies - 44%

&#x200B;

D) % of dark individuals under 65 with no medical coverage - 12.1%

&#x200B;

E) Leading reasons for death - coronary illness, malignancy, and inadvertent mishaps

&#x200B;

Wellbeing is a major thing on the grounds that being in terrible wellbeing makes carrying on with an incredible life troublesome. Dark Americans must gain from different societies how to support a sound way of life so it very well may be given to the people to come.",https://www.reddit.com/r/WomenHealthTreatments/comments/ga6vm4/growing_up_black_in_america_health_challenges/,Growing Up Black in America - Health Challenges,,1,0,1.0,mtokel

My periods have always been irregular and my doctor suspected that I wasn't ovulating. I tried using the Ovulation LH tests for a few months but I kept getting numerous positives so I don't think they were working for me (apparently common with PCOS)

My doctor prescribed me Metformin after 3 months of trying and I only took 500mg per day for a couple of months but could not build up to the 1500mg because it was making me so sick. So after 6 months of failed trying I decide to following the Getting Pregnant Plan I decided to give it one last shot using every method I could.

My research has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) with regard to the protection of the rights and welfare of human participants.

xhpp54,TwoXSupport,1663529357.0,So recently I noticed I am going to have my period soon and I saw my ex's family and we talked and going back to college to where my ex and I are talking again I got to overthinking and being nosey and an ugly part of myself came out jealousy he was volunteering with a sigma or frat and sorrotiy group and I got jealous and lashed out and was crying and a mess and I apologized and said I'd give him space but I feel like I fucked up but don't want to keep saying sorry like a broken record. Should I just give him some space and time?

xum0jk,TwoXSupport,1664809713.0,"Mods, please let me know if this isn‚Äôt allowed. I just wanted to drop a half-promo and half-call for mods for a subreddit I made. 

As a sex worker, I wanted a diverse space for sellers to promote their content without some of the inhibitions/invisible tape of promoting on the bigger NSFW subreddits. (Part of me also just really liked the idea of a space to nerd out with like minded people ‚ò†Ô∏è )

This sub was just created today, so it‚Äôs lacking in both members and mods. I would really like to get the message of this sub right and I don‚Äôt think that can happen by myself. If any of this interests you, please reach out! I don‚Äôt bite.
