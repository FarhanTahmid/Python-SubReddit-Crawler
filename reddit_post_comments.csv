This makes me so mad. I am sick of the medical community bot listeng to women, doing things without our consent, and just not understanding our bodies because they refuse to look into it! 
This is another one of the reasons I am terrified of surgery in general, and especially if I tear during pregnancy like my mother did with me. I am terrified of the ""husband stitch"" as they call it. 

Story time. So when I hit puberty, or some time during it, can't remember exact age. One of my labia minora grew linger than the other and stuck out of my labia majora. I had no clue this was normal. I had no idea the proper names for my anatomy. My mom did not know it was normal either. We tried to bring it up with our male family doctor. He did not really seem luke he wanted to talk about it. He said if it didn't cause pain I was probably ok and if I needed or wanted to could get surgery done in the future. I wish he would have assured me it is normal. I did not find out it was till I read something someone posted, I believe in here showing all sorts of vulva. This should be taught to physicians and people in general. I have always known a decent amount about mail genitalia and not my own. Especially since growing up you see dicks drawn everywhere, and talked about.

Another story. I could not tell you if my school was conservative or not. It was a weird mix of old tradition and modern diversity. You would have to know the area to understand. So I was never taught how to put a condom on. They did mention various forms of birth control. They did say that abstinance is the safest method. Which in a sense it is  for avoiding pregnancy and stds. I wouldn't say it was abstinance only but I would have liked more focus on preventative methods. We did learn a decent amount about both genitalias. We learned a decent amount about the process of pregnancy, enough to turn me off to the idea. Also, the part that always makes me giggle. For context my male teacher was mostly deaf and had a woman assistant always in the classroom . He could generally read your lips to know what you were saying. But one day he said, specifically to the boys in class, ""this is the clitoris, it is what makes women feel good, it's only known purpose is for pleasure. Make sure you focus on it when with a woman. Always make sure to pleasure her and not just yourself. "" (not exact wording but basically what he said).I love that he said that. Now I wish our class had even more detail. I learned more on my own research. I also found out years after me they learned how to do breast and testicle exams on themselves. 
Now in comparison, my bf went to an inner city school. They taught them how to use condoms and prevent pregnancy. But nothing about female anatomy. Or the menstrual cycle or anything. I have had to teach my bf stuff I thought was basic knowledge.",bex505

kf0d1g,"Holding your efforts in my positive thoughts. There is so much more to this than most people even think possible. It may sound crazy, but one way I've learned what works, is to imagine how things feel. Just lay back, and examine your body in your mind while comparing to things you know about. Then go beyond that. Once I realized the penis and clitoris had many of the same features, I was able to understand more. In 2017 I was in a motorcycle wreck. Distracted driver attempted a U-turn and came into my lanes of traffic. He stopped, and I had no way to miss. I slid into the car, and crushed my right leg and foot. On impact, I actually saw my foot explode in my mind. An off duty Paramedic stopped to assist. I was able to do a head to toe internally as he did external and compared notes. I have a report to nurse & Paramedic on helo that transported. BTW, first Paramedic said I was probably right about my foot. Once at ER, again, gave my own report, as well as all med history currents meds, and allergies. Trauma Doc said he really appreciated the info as they never get it as good. I had not lost conciousness at all. Trauma surgeon visited, and same thing. I have update on what was going on inside. Forward on a couple of days to Ortho Surgeon. He came in to find a biker with long grey hair and a long beard. Starting as he normally would, I stopped him and gave my background. Then explained what I felt. He said he was gonna NG to fix my leg for me, and I said it wouldn't work. He tried. I kept telling him to take it. After several tries, he told me he couldn't save it. We got rid of it that day. My recovery started immediately. With the knowledge I was able to gain over the years, I was fortunate to be able to use it to save the lives presented to me. I also was able to use it to not only save mine, but to understand all that was going on, and to make a faster recovery. Doc said 12-18 months, I told him 6. He said there was no way. My 24 year old daughter was sitting at foot of my bed and said ""Doc if my Daddy says he's going to do something, stay out of his way!"" I did it in under 6 months, took my first steps. Now, for a guy, the BEST thing was standing to pee, without having to hold on to anything except... Well, you know the part.
I seriously don't understand why the female body is so misunderstood. I know, part of it is that MEN have not taken the time to learn, and refused to teach. We are getting more women in the forefront to teach, and to try to heal. I'd like to think there are a few male doctors who have an open mind like me, and try to teach and treat properly. I'm very happy that the V.A. has Doctors and N.P.s that are primarily for women. There is still a long way to go, but our lady Veterans deserve the very best care just as I and other men do. 
Sorry for mumbling and running on like this. I sincerely hope that your efforts are full of SUCCESS! I'll be here to help support.

To whom it may concern,

It has recently come to my attention that you have decided NOT to include the clitoris’s nerves in ACOG’s curriculum. As an organization that purportedly claims to be for the  “advancement of women’s health care” and includes “access to high quality and safe health care for women” in your core values, this is an extremely disappointing decision. 

By not including the education on the clitoris’s nerve endings in your education material, you are clearly stating that a woman’s sexual enjoyment is unimportant. You are choosing to enforce the patriarchal and sexist idea that a woman’s sexual pleasure is of so little importance as to not even provide it a moments notice in the educating of specialists for a woman’s reproductive organs. 

Urologists obviously learn about the nerve endings in the penis. I take great offense that you are not willing to provide the same level of care to the women in our society. 

I would expect more from your organization, particularly in 2020.",starbrightstar

kf0d1g,"I signed. A bit of background. First off, I'm male. 2nd I'm a Dad. I have a daughter, and Granddaughters. I'm concerned for them, as much as I am for anyone here. I'm a Retired Tx. Peace Officer, Firefighter/Paramedic. I was also in USAF as PK during Viet Nam.
I've always taken my careers seriously, and got as much study and practical as I could. My medical part started with USAF. When I returned home, I had been doing things even surgeons here weren't. ER Docs loved having me around. Now, before anyone thinks I'm a glory hound, I'm not. There were and are others that have been just as dedicated and qualified as me. In addition to doing what the State required, I helped with the origination of the EMS system. I also was given the privilege and honor of being able to stand in on a lot of surgery, mostly trauma related. I also spent hours upon hours in a county ME's lab, assisting with autopsies. There you have time to examine things without jeopardizing a life. I asked a lot of questions. So many I often worries I'd be refused more time. One Doc said he wished his REAL students would step forward and ask questions like mine. I studied the human body thoroughly. From the hair on the head, to the lines on the feet. Babies have always been the very best thing to bring into this World! They are just so awesome. I've managed to deliver 17 in my time. In the bedroom on the bed, in the living room on the floor, in the street getting into my ambulance, along the highway at near supersonic speeds, in the driveway of two different ER's, going up the elevator with the OB/GYN standing next to me, being held back by insurance and hospital protocols, to the jungles of Viet Nam. I do NOT understand why ANY group would refuse to teach ANY REAL medical person total and complete anatomy. I even got time in the cadaver lab at a Texas university with medical students, so I could learn even more. One thing for certain, nerves are a critical, necessary, fragile thing in the human body. I did a lot of study, for my own pleasure too, typical male I guess. I learned everything I could about the female body. I did it so I could provide the best pleasure possible. See, male. But, by doing that, it made me more aware of the necessity of keeping everything intact, or repairing it if damaged. The clitoris is very rich in nerves. I don't think the drawing goes into enough detail. If the person drawing it, isn't fully aware, or presented with all the info, they wouldn't make it precise. Just as the penis, whether aroused or not, it is blood rich. Any kind of tear or cut to the clitoris of course is very critical, and needs immediate attention. If the person addressing this is NOT qualified either by their own ignorance, or the failure of it being taught is a severe injustice to the female. These issues need to be addressed from the newborn to the 100+ year old female. Each age group will need slightly different care for injury or medical needs. If a person is going to be a doctor Physicians Assistant, or Nurse Practitioner, they HAVE to be taught these things, with extreme understanding. In addition to this, there HAS to be more studies done to try to repair the loss of feeling, other issues. The Docs delivering babies need to be on top of things enough to know or suspect a potential tear, and ""make the snip"" beforehand. They have control of it then. It should never tear up, and it should be known in advance if the baby is too big to be delivered naturally, and go with a C-section instead. BTW, I'm not a big proponent of those, but sometimes they are needed.
I'm sure some reading this may not approve. I hope you understand I'm trying to provide support and some insight. I've also signed the petition. If I might be of help in anyway, let me know. If I've offended anyone that was not my intent. But if a lowly Paramedic and Para Jumper can know this stuff, there is NO EXCUSE for those responsible for teaching not to know it or teach it.

You have to understand it is not always easy to get through to these people. And preventing harm to women is what’s most important. So if an old man wants to ignore my requests to include basic female anatomy, I will do what it takes to get through to him. Make sense?

You are defending your actions of texting this person at what sounds like multiple numbers over the course of 1.5 years as not being harassment. You don't mention how often these texts were sent but from your tone and presence of a cease and desist, it seems reasonable to assume it was fairly frequently.

Texting someone at multiple numbers consistently over the course of years definitely seems to fall under the dictionary definition of harassment. Is it illegal? IANAL so I can't make that decision, especially from so little information. I just included that definition to contrast against how the dictionary defines it.",HypnotizedPotato

She’s mad that they’re not explicitly drawn out in certain textbooks or in, god forbid, WebMD (because that’s totally where a surgeon is getting their anatomical info from.) 

Here is something to understand about surgery- nerve damage and subsequent sensation loss is not uncommon. Some nerves are quite small and they are not always easy to dissect around. That’s why with joint surgeries people will often have a small patch of numbness for the entirety of their lives. We don’t know anything about her surgeon.

dwup3z,Weird for me that you actually undress in the middle of the room. All gynecologist i have been to in Austria have either small dressing rooms attached to the exam rooms or at least a screen/divider which you can undress behind.

mqc0v5,"One time in fourth grade I woke up on the fifth day of my period, and since there was no blood, I assumed I was done so I didn’t wear a pad that day. I then went to school, and inevitably went to the bathroom to see that I was not in fact done with my period. Imagine my embarrassment when I had to awkwardly walk to the nurse’s office and somehow ask for a pad. Even worse, a boy was standing right behind me when I had to ask. I know now that I shouldn’t have been so embarrassed, but the boys in my school were obviously super immature on the matter, and it was one of my first periods and I wasn’t exactly taught that it wasn’t anything to be ashamed of yet. Anyways, that’s the story of how I learned to continue wear a pad even when my period looks gone lmao",rosemaryfrog

kzm7ss,"I've been using tampons for a good 8 or so years now, except for at night when I use a pad (unless I'm up in less than 8hrs then I use a tampon lol). I find that even when my flow is heavy, I have a good couple of minutes before I start bleeding again once I've turned the shower off.

However, a year or two ago, I had surgery down there, meaning I couldn't use tampons for two or three months - I had to use pads all the time. I found that I had literal seconds to put on a pad before the blood started flowing again. After one shower the blood was *gushing* out of me and I hadn't even stepped out of the shower yet. I had to rinse myself off, and got a towel to shove between my legs while I sorted out a pad. It was a wild ride. 

Since using tampons again, this hasn't happened. It's like, the blood flow was a lot stronger or something when my body realised there was no tampon there to soak up the blood. Kind of interesting I think",Doowrender
kzm7ss,I tend to put some toilet paper by my towel so that I can shove it between my legs until I'm dry enough to put in a tampon so I dont end up staining my towel. Or if im using my menstrual cup I wash it and set it next to the tub and then put it in while I'm still showering so I don't have to worry about anything once I step out of the shower.,anthro_punk

Just kinda roll some off (enough to where it's not soggy and gross if you use it as a temp pad), and stick it under there while you dry yourself off. When you're done (even with putting on underwear and a pad) take it out and throw it in the trash or toilet.

So I tried to do your method, but for some reason my pad always seems to never stay put if I stick it to my underwear before putting on said underwear. Can't put it on before drying off the surrounding areas first neither. Not sure why, but I'm guessing it's an adhesive issue? 

Anyway, whatever works for you I guess! Lmao
I've personally never had issue with the tissue shredding and getting everywhere. Usually when I stick some paper up there, it just comes out as one glob of paper that I just throw into the toilet. I do notice some breakage if I use a thinner paper, so maybe it's the type of paper we use? Our movements? Idk, but hey, I'm sorry if I sounded judgemental in my OP.

t5k3mr,"That is some weird wording but I know that a lot of doctors (male or female) will talk to you about the random, mundane things to get your mind off of the fact that they just stuck a cold metal object up ya vag. 

I remember something similar was said to me and the female nurse whipped around and was like “you couldn’t have worded that differently?” At which point I burst out laughing which pushed the damn speculum out and the doctor was like “I’m so so sorry, I just was trying to do some small talk to distract you and I now need to replace the speculum”

ETA: at that time it was a female doctor subbing for my regular male doctor. My regular male doctor  would tell dad jokes before the exam started to try and ease some of the anxiety and say “I know this is an awful procedure for you, so at any point if you are uncomfortable, I will stop and we’ll figure something else out” so yeah, I had better care from a male doctor than the female gyno I saw after him.",ehdenoudsten91

t5k3mr,"I remember when I went to my first gyno appointment, I was so nervous that I had gone pale. My (Male) gyno came in and looked at me and the first thing he said to me was “are you alright” I was like “yeah I’m fine” and he was like “are you sure cuz you look like you just saw a ghost” and I said “well I’m not going to lie, I’m a little nervous” which he responds with “oh there nothing to be scared of” as he pulled his little seat directly in front of my spread legs. Before I could even say anything back to him he says “okay we’re going to get started, you’re going to feel some slight pressure on your bottom, but don’t be scared that is just the speculum” which I responded with “oh okay” and then he looks up at me and makes dead eye contact with me and goes “also please for the love of god do not close your legs on me, I am very claustrophobic” which made me laugh and calmed my nerves a bit. I then responded with “well don’t cause me any pain and we shouldn’t have a problem” he then reached his hand up in between my legs and said “deal” he then realized where that hand was just at and then looked at it and then back to me and goes “oh right” which made me laugh even harder.

t5k3mr,"I’ve had much better care from male obgyns in my long experience of being an obgyn patient. Of course they’re NOT all good, the on-call Dr. who delivered my first kid was a complete asshole. As I was trying to push my son out he commented ‘aren’t you a bit young to be having a baby?’ I was 20, yes obviously I was too young but that’s none of his damn business. I ended up getting induced with my second kid just so I could have my own amazing male obgyn deliver her, and not risk getting the on-call asshole. Third kid I delivered naturally in a birthing center with midwives 😂.         

Now that I’m in the perimenopause zone I lucked out on this incredible male Muslim obgyn after having a very shitty traumatic experience with a white female obgyn who wanted to take my uterus out just because I had heavy periods. And she fought with me that I was not in perimenopause (lady, for fucks sake I’m 49! Of course I’m at least in early perimenopause!) my new guy lets me adjust my HRT without question whenever I’m experiencing symptoms, and was fine with using a combination of birth control pills as HRT (it’s free instead of paying $$$ for HRT which is basically the same hormones) now I’m feeling great, I still have all my organs, no more anemia, all thanks to him!!",fabulousandmessy

e8awbg,"Sounds like you're not clear about the distinction between sex and gender! Sex is male/female/intersex and is determined by many physical factors such as hormone levels, presence of ovaries/testes, chromosomal makeup, and secondary sex characteristics. Some of these characteristics are mutable, while others will always stay the same.

Gender is usually defined in terms of man/woman/nonbinary, where nonbinary is an umbrella term that encompasses all identities outside of man and woman. Gender is determined by how someone feels, how they present, and how they interact with other people. A person's gender isn't necessarily connected to their sex. This is how a man can have a uterus and menstruate.",anonima_

e8awbg,"The comments and this post stink of transphobia. 

My brother is trans (female biologically), you would never think by looking at him he was female. This boy has periods still. 

You’re either completely denying the fact that trans people are now either boy or girl of the opposite gender and if that’s so then stick by ‘boys can’t have periods’ but you’re denying that trans people aren’t allowed to live their lives as the opposite gender. If that’s not the case and they are in your view boys, then yes trans boys have periods too. 

No one is saying that people who are biologically male and transitioning to a women are having periods. However, people who are living as men can still have periods. Just because this sort of thing doesn’t affect you doesn’t mean you can down play someone else’s experiences as living as a boy and having a period. 

And shouting just stating facts is inherently wrong because you’ve stated nothing that is a fact other than only females can have a period which no one is denying. However what you’re failing to state is that gender dysphoria and other issues relating to people being trans are also a biological fact. There are differences in their brain chemistry and measurable differences in hormone release that make them feel the way they do. There’s also the psychological difference between sex and gender and that gender is a social norm and construct that we have usually related with someone’s biological sex which is now not the case. Maybe if you actually picked up a biology book you’d understand it’s not black and white.",ElectricalInflation
e8awbg,"I'm aware I'll be downvoted for this, but personally I agree with a lot of points by the LGBT community that things like tampons or pads should not be so overly feminine because it just makes a period for a trans man that much harder.

e8awbg,"I’m not trans.

But when people say that their bodies are perceived one way but they feel another...

When being misidentified over and over makes kids and teens kill themselves...

When you learn that there is so much more variation in sex organs, sex hormone levels, and even chromosomes than most of us have been led to believe, and that a lot of those differences have been covered up or non-consensually medically altered...

When you have the opportunity to meet and talk to and learn from (and read articles written by) trans people and gender nonconforming people...you learn they’re just people, like everyone else, who want happy lives lived as authentically as possible, free from violence. 

You learn to believe them.

The medical community has acknowledged that being trans is not a mental illness - it’s an identity.

Refusing to acknowledge someone’s gender identity is a form of bullying. It doesn’t affect you. But you’re affecting them. And if you refuse to open your mind, if you deny yourself the opportunity to learn, you not only miss out on knowing some pretty cool people, but you run the risk of allowing your discomfort or misunderstanding or fear or hatred to cause real violence.

And make no mistake, posts like these are a form of violence the way bullying someone is violence. Excluding trans men and others from this community makes it not a safe place.

In an online discussion forum who cares what you are as long as you have a period?

So, *effectively* they're men. They live as men, they may have ""M"" on their driver's license and birth certificate if they've gone through the process of all the necessary legal paperwork and changes, they're called ""sir"" and ""mister"" when they walk in a room.

You can insist that social roles don't matter, only biology, but you don't interrogate the biology of everyone you meet day-to-day, do you? You accept them, generally speaking, as a man or a woman based on their social cues of dress and hairstyle and behavior, and on secondary sexual characteristics like presence or absence of facial hair, breasts, voice range, etc. Gender stems from biology, but the ways in which we recognize gender are entirely socially constructed.

I have no doubt that black women were referred to as ""female"" rather than ""woman"" as a way to dehumanize them, but find it hard to believe that white women wouldn't have been referred to as ""female"" in medical contexts. This seems more like the use of ""boy"" for black men, which was intentionally degrading but didn't mean that white male children weren't referred to as boys.

edit: For anyone curious, ""male"" and ""female"" are the terms used on historical US censuses: in 1800, [""number of free white females""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1800_United_States_Census); in [1850](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/1850_census_Lincoln.gif) and [1900](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/1900_census_Kershaw_Lindauer.gif), ""m"" and ""f"" used to denote sex. It's reasonable to assume that white females were referred to as women conversationally and that ""female"" would have been seen as rude. But the strongest versions of this claim are that ""female"" was invented specifically to dehumanize enslaved black women and was never used in any context for white women. That's simply not true. ""Female"" is the term that gets used in many formal settings (medical, legal) and ""woman"" is simply a conversational and more polite term for females; neither are race-specific in those formal contexts. This has been true as far back as 1800, and I'm sure someone with too much time on their hands could dig up other historical evidence from earlier.",ssssecrets

Sex = male or female. 
Male = XY chromosomes, sperm production, penis etc..
Female = XX, ova production, vulva etc...

Species = type of animal. Eg. Humans, sloth, cat, monkey, etc etc. 

Age = whether you are sexually mature and can bare offspring. 
Adult = sexually mature and able to bare offspring. 
Juvenile = sexually immature and unable to bare offspring. 

None of the above criteria can be changed, even with advances in technology. If I get Botox to look younger, my physical age won’t change. If I get whiskers implanted in my cheeks, my DNA will not become more feline - it will still be 100% human. If I take testosterone, I will still have XX chromosomes and the potential to produce ova. I will still be 100% female. 

Therefore...

Man = adult human male
Boy = juvenile human male
Woman = adult human female
Girl = juvenile  human female

Stallion/gelding = adult male horse
Mare = adult female horse
Colt = juvenile male horse
Filly = juvenile female horse.

Males cause 98% of violence in this world. Until that is solved females can never be 100% safe which is why we require (and fought for) spaces for ourselves.

Regarding suicide: to be misgendered a handful of times while the person is attempting to transition socially and/or medically and they clearly don't look to be the opposite sex yet but they're trying, and the misgendering is accidental, I agree with you that it's kinda insane to kill yourself for that.

Males say that testosterone makes them aggressive, than act like that. Everytime a little boy is violent people look at him and say it's normal and he's growing. If a little girl does the same she is instantly repressed and learn to not behave like that. If she continues she is mostly likely being called savage or crazy after growing. While violent guys are called masculine by most people. (Yes, we have a little portion who calls him for ""toxic masculinity"").

e8awbg,"“Man” and “woman” ARE scientific, biological terms. They tell you the age and sex of an individual human. “Male” and “female” only tell you sex and are terms used throughout the animal kingdom. 

If I say “that female just gave birth”, what am I talking about? Is it a human? Is it a zebra? Is it a wolverine? Who knows??? 

However, if I say “that woman just gave birth” we all know exactly what it means. It means an (adult) human female has given birth. 

Same if I say “that mare just gave birth”. It means an (adult) female horse has given birth. 

Similarly, if I say “that male is running”, no one has any idea what I am talking about 

If I say “that boy is running”, however, everyone knows i am talking about a young human male. 

Same with “that colt is running” - people know I am talking about a young male horse running. 

Stop trying to erase our word and our biology. They provide important context and make it easier for us to all understand each other. 

You are confusing them for “masculine” and “feminine”, which refer to social constructs stereotypically assigned to sex. Masculine and feminine are the gender terms you are looking for, not man and woman. 

Transmen aren’t men because they are not human males. Instead they are masculine women. 

Transwomen aren’t women because they are not human females. Instead they are feminine men.",AmberOEC
e8awbg,"I don't think you can say that chromosomes don't make a single difference. For one, they influence the amount of oh-so-important hormones you produce. Men have higher testosterone levels, and women have higher oestrogen/progesterone levels. I don't think there is a consensus on how these hormones influence behaviour, but I guess these are things that will be discovered now that more and more people are taking cross-sex hormones. 

As much as I don't want to admit it, there *are* average behavioural differences between men and women that can't be exclusively tied down to socialisation. In [this study](https://www.thejournal.ie/gender-equality-countries-stem-girls-3848156-Feb2018/), it shows that the number of women in STEM-based jobs is lower in societies where women have more freedom to choose what they want to do. 

The solution isn't to deny that there are differences between men and women - the solution is to stop giving more value to one trait over another. E.G. logical vs compassionate. Both traits have their advantages and disadvantages - it doesn't have to mean being one is better than the other. 

The people who choose not to have children or have reproductive issues are still male or female. They are simply men and women with reproductive health issues. Same with intersex people. I often see trans rights activists claim that sex isn't binary because intersex people exist, but this is incredibly interphobic. Intersex people are still either male or female - they just have a developmental disorder that is specific to their sex. 

The people that challenge stereotypes are GNC people. The ones who own their sex. The women who say ""I hate make-up and love fixing cars, but I'm no less a woman"", or the men who love to bake or wear heels or do whatever they want to do without putting a label on it.

Trans people do nothing to challenge gender stereotypes - they reinforce them because they say ""I feel like a woman so I must be a woman"". But what does a woman feel like? I honestly couldn't tell you because I don't know how every woman experiences the world: I only have my own experiences.  

Maybe you can tell me what label I should use? I know my sex because I have a vagina, but what about my gender? I'm a pretty conforming woman myself. Skirts and dresses are my preferred items of clothing. I like the colour baby pink. I wear make up and my hair is long and soft due to the styling effort I put into it. But my personality does not match this. I'm argumentative and confrontational. I've been told by multiple people that I am ""too cold"" or ""too logical"" and they don't like coming to me for advice. I haven't cried in months. 

When I was a teenager, I read a dumb article that suggested that having a ring-finger longer than your index finger meant you had a male brain. The article was pseudo-science based on [2D:4D digit ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digit_ratio). It all made so much sense to me, and gave me an explanation for why I am the way I am after years of trying to make myself more soft and passive. I proudly showed off my long ring finger and said ""I have a male brain!!"" and I thought I was so much better than my ""female brained"" counterparts because it made me different and ""not like other girls"". 

Eventually I got over my internalised misogyny and I learnt that there are so many women out there who are assertive and non-sensitive. I'm not special. I'm just a woman with a set of personality traits. I sometimes even get envious of more empathetic and compassionate women (and men!) because I see the way they relate and bond to others so easily. It doesn't mean lesser type of woman. Even if I started wearing boxers and ties and cuff-links, I would still would be the same amount of woman as I am in a dress because I am an adult human female. 

Yet if I had been a teenager in 2019, there is no doubt in my mind that I would have felt pressure to come out as non-binary or some other crap. 

Stop encouraging people to get into boxes. The only labels you need are biological because your health is effected by your sex. These labels are man/woman and male/female. Everything else is just personality.",AmberOEC

> gender as a tool of oppression


Gender is a tool of oppression used by the patriarchy to control and keep women under submission.  Gender is socially constructed ideals under patriarchy for how men and woman should behave and be treated based on their sex. Gender is the found in gender roles and femininity. It's what says women need to be quiet, submissive, to be caring. It's what says that women aren't as smart as men, that women are too emotional. It says that real women should wear make-up to make themselves more attractive to men. It says that women's biggest goal in life is to bare children. Gender is what kept women out of leadership positions, working, owning land, and being heirs. 



When the trans community says that gender exists, they are saying that these sexist regressive stereotypes that harm both men and women are innate in the sexes. They are saying that because they don't adhere to the ""innate gender"" that they aren't that gender they are the other gender. Thus reinforcing the idea that socially constructed gender is not socially constructed and instead is actually innate in both sexes and cannot be abolish nor can women or men be liberated from it's constraints.



By admitting that gender is harmful and not innate in the sexes, we as a society can fight to eliminate this ideology so that men and women can behave however they would like.",JollyPurple

And in a culture where no one wants to be discriminatory, bigoted or offensive (i.e setting boundaries is the devil incarnate 🙄), authority figures allow these pedophiles and abusers more leeway into the law (not to mention pedophilia trying to weasel their way into the LGBT+ community). What a way to completely devalue actual trans people's struggles to carve out their own place in society! And then shit all over women in the process.

Having transwomen claiming they can have periods and invading women's spaces is just absurd and delusional. I wish they'd acknowledge their biology and their limitations and stay in their lane. Y'all might be ""female"" mentally (that's up for debate), but physically, you 100% aren't and that no way makes you ""female by definition"" just because your brain might reflect otherwise. No uterus, no period: not a biological woman. Get over it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ It's not rocket science.",wispo-wills
e8awbg,"The point I'm trying to make is that there can be instances where a real trans person is being purposefully misgendered because the bully is trying to get a reaction from the trans person. That's harassment. It's like when certain LGBT+ people purposefully misgender trans people like Blaire White solely because they disagree with her (because she's not leftist enough to be, by their definition, actually transgendered). Or in the case of families not supporting their transgendered person, they may purposefully misgender to belittle and subdue that family member. Among, of course, other things.

I don't think misgendering is the biggest deal, but if it's in a mix of other verbally abusive words, that is harassment.

Well, a mental health check, a brain scan, a look into family history and upbringing should help decipher whether or not Yaniv and people like him are truly trans or just a sick pervert. Since there is science behind transgenderism, there are ways to prove who's real and who isn't. Although that would be a matter of consent from the person in question. I don't personally believe he's trans but it doesn't exactly matter: a pervert is a pervert no matter how you slice it. It's just a matter of how law enforcement deals with it: if they don't want to touch it because they don't want to appear transphobic, then there's clearly a problem here. But if they can see past it (which, fortunately, Canadian law enforcement did), then it's slightly less important. But only in regards to how severe and obvious the offense is. If it's minor but still a problem in society, police are less likely to sniff around.",wispo-wills

e8awbg,"“Man” and “woman” also have nothing to do with gender. These are biological criteria that determine a human’s age and sex. 

Female = produces ova/has XX chromosomes etc. 
Male = produces sperm/has XY chromosomes etc. 

The above two terms are used throughout the animal kingdom. 

Woman = adult (age) human (species) female (sex)
Man = adult human male
Girl = juvenile (age) human (species) female (sex)
Boy = juvenile human male

The above terms are biological descriptions used to determine demographics for the human species. Every animal has this. For example:

Mare = adult (age) horse (species) female (sex)
Stallion/gelding = adult horse male
Filly = juvenile horse female
Colt = juvenile horse male. 

If you want to talk about social constructs and gender, the terms you are looking for are masculine and feminine. 

No one believes you can change your age or your species (except maybe furries?), and sex is no different. I can put Botox in my forehead and implant whiskers in my cheeks, but it won’t make me physically any younger or any less human. FtM people can inject as much testosterone as they like, but it doesn’t mean they suddenly develop the ability to produce sperm. They are still female. MtF people can cut their penises off and take oestrogen, but they will never physically be female because they will never produce ova. They are still male.

Furthermore, being born into one sex means we literally cannot know what it is really like to be the other, as we are trapped in our subjectivity. Much of the differences between Male and female behavior and thought stems from biological differences. Taking hormones is simply not enough. Belief is not enough. We cant fully imagine another person's experience anymore than we can fully understand what it's like to be a cat. All we see of other people is a tip of the iceberg, we never have access to another person's inner world or all their experiences.

What we *do* know is that some people have really strong discomfort with their sex (whether they're male or female), and sometimes feel uncomfortable when others recognize it. 

There's different ways of understanding this- in the way they're teaching in schools, that everybody has a gender identity and you only notice it when it doesn't match, or in another way, that we don't have gender identities, but some people have different mental health conditions, and one of those is gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder. There's nothing wrong with having psych disorders, a lot of people do and it doesn't mean anything bad about them. And everybody deserves care and fair treatment. When you combine identity politics in with the trans lobby, and the popularity with identifying yourself with labels nowadays, and the shutting down of free speech, it means that gender identity beliefs are enforced on all people, despite most people not believing in them, kind of like religion was. 

The problem is that trans ideology hurts the fight for female people's rights, and even steals the word that female people used to call themselves. One of the main problems with patriarchal oppression is that it's always okay to dismiss women's feelings. Gender as a social construct was a feminist concept, but in terms of queer theory, nobody can define what a gender is when questioned, without using stereotypes or tautology. We should never dismiss anybody's feelings, and they can be a good jumping off point for further discussion, but we should have appropriate responses to emotions, not make laws based only on someone's feelings the moment they have enough political power to silence everyone who disagrees with them.",villanelle23eve

Interesting, I do not feel female much like I do not feel like my hair color or eye color or height or shoe size, I simply am, I feel like me. What does feeling female entail?

Saying gender identity is the personal sense of gender is a picture perfect example of a cyclical non definition ie. A chair is a chair is a chair. 

Those sets of rules talked about are oppressive gender stereotypes and roles
 If you follow that logic, besides being unfeminist and offensive,  that would mean women identify with their oppression. It would also mean women and men who do not follow those stereotypes or roles are somehow less of a woman/man.

I used to use an app called Selene and I *loved* it.

Unfortunately, Yahoo bought it out and it's been removed from the US app store... 😭 I still have it installed on my phone since I downloaded it before the acquisition, but I've been trying a few other apps to hopefully try and move to soon. I've enjoyed Eve, though their marketing can be a little annoying for non-Health related notifications (there are paid features in the app besides the basic Health related stuff and they push that). Their calendar for prediction is pretty accurate and easy to edit, and they can also give you multiple options for different types of notifications of reminders (period, pill, etc). You do have to use it for a little while before you get an exact estimate of prediction, but I've liked it so far. It also connects to the Apple Health app!",thewizardlizard

I've never used one, but my understanding is you fold them along the length squishing the open bit together, and insert them that end first with the pointy end down.

They have to be wide enough to create a seal inside so that no blood leaks out. The vaginal canal widens more than probably most people realise.

Seems complicated but it's very simple. My periods are to show up tomorrow, my calendar says the Moon entered a new phase between Thursday and Friday, so there are 4 full days before Monday. Quite an unclear situation, they could either show up today or even delay till next week.

Edit: since I, along with others, are being downvoted for following the manufacturer’s instructions, [I’m just going to leave this here](https://divacup.com/how-it-works/care-and-cleaning/).

> At the end of your cycle, wash the DivaCup as you normally do with either the DivaWash or warm water and a mild, unscented water-based (oil-free) soap. As needed, you can boil the DivaCup in an open pot of boiling water for five to ten (5 -10) minutes with plenty of water. Do not leave the boiling pot unattended.

Soft cup was my go to back when they first came out and were reusable. I refused to keep buying them when they took them from the market and switched them up. 

The cups are different in that the soft cup sits much higher up and snug against your cervix. The diva cup sits right in your vagina and is held in place by vaginal muscles (someone correct me if I’m wrong here...but this is how both devices seem to fit for me). 

IMO, the diva cup was a little more difficult to get used to WRT insertion and removal, but still 100% worth it. The package recommends 2 different techniques to fold it before insertion. There’s a way to fold it in 1/2 (so the rim makes a “C”) and a way to fold an edge down (apparently there are other folds...it may be helpful to google this if you’re having trouble). I have to fold the edge down because there’s no way I’m getting it in otherwise. 

The package instructions also tell you to grab the end once it’s in and rotate to make sure it’s all unfolded and in place. This is annoying to try to do because the cup is hard to grab. I usually just feel around the cup to make sure the one edge isn’t folded in. 

Emptying is still messier than the softcup, IMO, but I also have really heavy periods and fill up the cup more than once. 

It’s a little bit of a learning curve, but well worth knowing that you’re not wasting plastic and money every month. I also had problems with cyclical BV/general irritation that I think was from the chemicals they use to treat the fibers in tampons. I’ve had zero problems since switching to the cup. 

Good luck! Feel free to shoot me a message if you want or make a post if you’re having problems. There are a bunch of cup users on this sub.",xGiaMariex
bjb9u3,You could try a Ziggy cup which is a reusable soft cup. I think there are like 4 different brands that make discs that are reusable. I think you’d probably need to learn a little more about your vagina to make sure your getting the right cup such as where your cervix sit how strong your pelvic floor is and all that jazz since you don’t want to waster your money. I’m pretty sure the discs are the same no matter what vagina you have. Might be worth a shot to check them out.,luvmyfam2379

bjb9u3,"They make little fold out silicone pots for putting the cup in in the microwave, ‘menstrual cup sterilising pot’ or something similar should show results. I don’t boil mine either, but I’ve got one of these in case I need it. I get that people worry about these things, bu at the same time sex toy companies are still selling things that aren’t 100% silicone or ABS plastic, and even for the ones that are silicone, boiling isn’t generally a recommended cleaning method. And that’s for toys going in...more than one place. It’s an option, but it’s not something that I think is drastically needed. Not to mention, how sterile are tampons, really?",ColourfulConundrum

bjb9u3,"I can't, my daughter has OCD and even knowing I used a pan I don't cook in, she couldn't eat anything cooked on the stove for a month after I boiled the cup. I thought I was going to have to replace the stove so she would eat again. So I wash the cup with Hibiclens, and set it out in the sunlight for a few hours (gets rid of discoloration). I've been doing that a long time and it's been fine. If I'm still having periods when my daughter moves out, maybe I'll start boiling the cup every month.",fire_thorn
bjb9u3,"Lol my girlfriend has literally probably never washed hers. It's looks like a haggard old vet. I'd be worried about TSS but I am pretty sure she's a super human and is impervious to injury and illness, so it's fine.

Maybe she'd rinse it with some catchment water, idk. Just kidding..  kinda not really.",None
bjb9u3,"It’s definitely not an active thing you have to do. 

I was really afraid of leaks too. Before the cup, I would fill up an ultra tampon (like...the biggest ones they make...whatever those are called) AND fill up a pad in 1-2 hours. I’ve leaked through everything with this method quite a few times doing all of this and messed up my clothes. 

I wear a pad just in case the first few days when my period is really heavy and I have leaked the tiniest bit. I started off by wearing the cup when I was at home or when I knew I was going to have easy access to a restroom because I didn’t trust it. 

I also used to wear tampons to bed and wear them well past the “safe amount of time”. I’d be paranoid of getting sick every time. I don’t have to worry about that either.",xGiaMariex

caoizt,"Why is it a “rare case”? BV occurs when there is an imbalance of the gardnerella vaginalis bacteria (in this case, overgrowth). Intercourse doesn’t need to occur for this to happen.

She blamed the insane “Pinterest fads” that result in women sticking tampons doused with essential oils and douching artisanal vinegars as the likely culprit. I don’t think it’s necessarily rare outside of intercourse at all...depends on how sensitive your PH is. Pushing a narrative that it’s rare might discourage someone who is a virgin or sexually inactive to seek medical help when they have BV symptoms because they assume they can’t get it, and instead self-medicate with OTC yeast meds (which are notorious for causing BV).

SOME CRAMPING IS COMPLETELY NORMAL! Periods are not a pleasant time lol. 

But passing out because your in so much pain is not normal. Needing narcotics to get through your period is not normal. For many it can be solved rather simply with things like birth control. Others that doesn’t help. 

As you said stress and diet can affect your pain also exercise. Many things can make it worse or help it. But typically with endometriosis things like that may help it but not take it all way.

Not normal is a 8-10 out of 10. It hurts so bad you could cry or are crying. You’re not able to stand up. Not able to do your normal duties or chores. You probably couldn’t go to the store if you tried and if you did, you know you probably shouldn’t have. You don’t have a choice in staying home. You’re physically crippled by what’s happening inside you.

Edit: Basically I’m saying that your pain shouldn’t be about other people’s pain. We all feel pain differently, but we shouldn’t let that diminish the validity of our own pain. Look at a pain scale and rate it 1-10. That’s the pain you’re feeling.",BombayAndBeer

I thought It was normal and I was told that it was just part of being a woman.

I just wanted to share this because I see so many people posting on here asking if their pain is normal. And nobody should be in agony during their period! I hope this helps explain a bit.

h9thf4,"I know right. Like why can't we teach women and young girls that a degree of pain is normal. The uterus literally contracts to push out the lining of the uterus. Blood vessels contract to aid with the flow. There is general inflammation within the uterus during menses. Of course there will be pain. Often, pain can change with age to. It could be worse when you are young, ease up in your 20s and hurt again in your 30s it doesn't always mean there is a problem. 

I just feel like it another thing for women to feel less than perfect about. Like, oh shit, is my body not as good as the women who have no pain and light flows? It must be Endo.

I never passed out or puked, but i frequently felt like i was going to do both. Cried/screamed from the pain, had dark thoughts about just removing my uterus (tho I want children) just to be free of the pain, took 800g of ibuprofen just to lessen the pain... I wish I had known sooner that bc would help me with the pain... I still can't believe I just put up with the pain monthly for 10 years...",fantasynerd92
h9thf4,"It has been previously. I went to the doctor 4 years ago for an emergency appointment when the pain was so bad that I had to call in to work. I went in and they scheduled a transvaginal ultrasound. They found that I had several ovarian cysts but said I didn’t have endo. I didn’t know until recently that endo can’t be diagnosed through an ultrasound (from Reddit actually!). My pain has gotten to where it’s not just during or around my periods. I’m on birth control and have been for about 5 years now and my body bleeds when it wants. I have pain for at least 2 days before and 2 days after my periods that are 7-10 days long. But I got a stomach ulcer from having to take so much ibuprofen in an attempt to alleviate cramps and the muscle relaxer I was prescribed since then doesn’t do much. It’s weird, because I’m scared that something is wrong with me but I’m also scared there isn’t and I am just being dramatic.",Garnet0908

Then shamed me when i said I wanted to the ibuprofen first. And to be clear, I have vomiting, passing out, giving birth, level period pain. That was completely alleviated with prescription dose ibuprofen.",ftr-mmrs

h9thf4,Ultrasounds can detect other things that can cause painful periods like cysts and fibroids. So it wasn’t useless! It just can’t tell you if you have endo.

I can relate to the ibuprofen situation a little bit. I used to have to take it around the clock during my period and still didn’t take my pain away. I went to a gyn and she did a pelvic exam found nothing and said i was fine. I believed her for awhile. But the pain got worse it seemed and ibuprofen did less and less and I was taking more than I know I should’ve been. But I was just trying to find some sort of relief. I went to a new gyn and he mentioned endometriosis so quickly when I explained my pain. He was concerned with the ibuprofen and said to stop taking it because he said I was going to get stomach ulcers. He prescribed me different and stronger painkillers that help a bit more and won’t cause stomach ulcers. And I got a transvaginal ultrasound. 

I’m undiagnosed but having a gyn who believed me meant so much. I felt so alone always because nobody I knew had the same amount of pain during their period growing up. I felt weak.

h9thf4,I am glad to hear it! Finding a good doctor who cares is so important:),Tinydancr1
h9thf4,A Pap smear is a very good thing to get done but it is a test for cervical cancer so it wouldn’t be a test for a cause of painful period cramps. But I’m glad it came back normal!:) The ultrasound should be able to say more whether it detects things like cysts or fibroids. Or if nothing is found then those things can be eliminated. Just a note that endometriosis can only be officially diagnosed through surgery. Tests like MRIs and ultrasounds can help detect things that may be related but cannot officially diagnose. Just letting you know in case:) good luck!,Tinydancr1
h9thf4,Ok gotcha! I understand I spent years thinking my pain was normal or that I was just weak. My first gyn was a horrible experience. Now I have a gyn that listens to my pain and takes it seriously. I am glad you are getting a second opinion it is important to listen to our bodies. I wish you the best of luck!,Tinydancr1
h9thf4,"That promo indirectly suggests women with extreme pain have endo. You know what women with extreme pain may also have extreme period pain. The kind caused by the prostaglandins that cause the period to start. You know whaty treats that? Ibuprofen. In my entire lifetime, I have yet to see an ad either by a medical organization womens health organization, pharma company, or anything for an ad to make you try ibuprofen for period pain. Not a single one, and there are a sh*t ton of ads for every drug for every obscure problem. And there used to be ads for all kinds of pain the ibuprofen could treat. Except not period pain.

And you know what? It blows my mind how every day someone posts here in r/periods asking aboit that to take for the pain, and so often they havent even heard of it. Every.Day.

h9thf4,I agree that there are many things that can cause extreme period cramps. Hence why it is important to find a caring doctor. I think there needs to be more education on periods in general. I appreciate you mentioning that many people don’t know about simple things such as ibuprofen to help with cramps. It is something I will pay more attention to. But with endometriosis a lot of times ibuprofen doesn’t help or only eases the pain slightly. Hence why in the video she mentions needing narcotics. Many people with extreme period pain are just told to take ibuprofen and just end up taking more and more to try and get it to take the pain away.,Tinydancr1

h9thf4,"I appreciate that you see the need for more discussion amd awareness. Endo famously is not alleviated with ibuprofen. But, to reiterate, extreme period pain does not directly imply endo. In fact, not responding to ibuprofen is a major sign that something else may be going on (and endo isn't the only other cause of extreme period pain). Ads like this one conflate all of these issues, and dont help to educate women about what may be going on. And it especially doesnt help that it is dressed up with a woman dressed as a doctor.

However, I do understand and appreciate that you can see the need for communication around these issues.",ftr-mmrs
h9thf4,"Thank you, it is important to discuss and listen to each other and hear other people’s views and experiences. Looking at your other comment I am sorry your doctor shamed you for wanting ibuprofen. If it works for you and it is a healthy amount that won’t affect your health than there should be no shame in taking it! Thank you for sharing your experience. 

Just wanted to note that she is a fertility physician. Not just someone dressed up as a doctor. 

And yes there definitely needs to be more education on women’s bodies!!",Tinydancr1
h9thf4,"Their shaming had more to do with not trusting me to making my own decisions around birth control. The irritating thing was their complete dimissal of my concerns around taking birth control and using shaming (and other manipulation tactics) instead of just letting me make my own informed decision. But thats how it is with women trying to navigate the healthcare field. I will say at least they opened with providing all the facts/choices available to me. Which is more than what the first gyno I saw did.

Also, I fully believed the woman in the video was a physician. That is what makes it more infuriating. She thinks she is cute? I think its disgusting a professional did this.",ftr-mmrs

I’m like you though. I know I would be a horrible mother, if not in practice at least internally. I would resent my children if I were forced to have them.

In general, child bearing is such a bad deal for most women (especially since most men aren’t cut out to be fathers & end up being lazy bums who expect their wives to take care of 90% household and kid stuff while working outside the home) and I totally support going child free.

I know for sure I don’t want biological children. If I wouldn’t already be suffering from pregnancy itself (it does not sound fun! How you people have the strength to endure it I’ll never know), surely the dysphoria would kill me but that’s slightly off-topic. I really just want a doctor to tie the whole things off, eventually, but I think if in the event I do actually trust someone enough to raise a child with them, adopting would be a viable option for me. I think if I really did want a kid later on, I would go through the arduous, tiring process of adoption for it, and it would still be better (for me) than pregnancy.

I think everyone has a right to decide what works best for them & just because something is bad for one person, doesn’t mean it’s bad for the other. 

Right now, I weirdly feel better than I did pre-pregnancy. I have ADHD & it’s been so much better lately (the severely is heavily influenced by hormones & apparently pregnancy hormones = good for me). I’ve also had more energy during the day but also need more sleep at the same time. I don’t have any other pregnancy symptoms besides sore boobs (which I always got due to PMS anyways). Your propensity for morning sickness is genetic & neither my mom or grandmother ever experienced it across 8 pregnancies total; so luckily, I likely won’t get it. Most of the moms in my bump sub (due the same month) are getting morning sickness already. I’m definitely nervous about giving birth, but easy births run in my family so I’m hoping I inherited that propensity as well.

1ckfcot,"So fun fact, for some women, arousal is very mental. With physical acts being more assistive or in partnership with the mental images or scenarios that turn you in. For example: if you really enjoy voice play as your primary source of arousal, then your partner should ideally participate in that as they work with your body.

Women can have different things that stimulates arousal. Sounds, imaginary/role play, atypical erogenous zones, non-sexual touch, temp play, visuals: voyeur and exhibition etc.

It's all in the kink category but in general, mental stimulation is the foundations of kink. What isn't inherently sexual can be very arousing for some people.

1ckfcot,"Your post doesn't mention how old you are but women's bodies are like that and I think it can happen more as you age.

I would find a lube that makes you feel sexy (there are plenty of brands with different smells, packaging, sensations) and roll with it. Place it somewhere accessible so it doesn't ruin the mood (I keep one upstairs and one downstairs for practicality). Play with it on your own first. Experiment with some different types and see what you like. 

It's a great way to indicate consent and control (which can change the sexual power balance in your relationship if you like?) 

It's a great way to increase your own enjoyment (people without dryness use it for a reason) 

I recommend coconut oil, just a tub of the stuff you can buy in any supermarket.

Vaginal dryness is a symptom. Other possible symptoms:
  Is your period irregular? Do your boobs ever feel ""full"" and painful? Any recent weight gain, anxiety, fatigue, or hot flashes?
If yes, ask your doctor to give you a blood test to check your prolactin level. If it comes back high, then you'll get an MRI of your pituitary gland to confirm.",olive_dix

It was something we both had to sit down and chat about because i didn’t want him getting upset, and i didn’t want him to feel like i wasn’t as into him. It wasn’t anything anyone was doing, but it was probably the change in hormones with the birth control. We just started using lube and everything is fine. Someone who actually loves you will not mind using lube. They will understand that there will be days you just can’t get as wet. It’s not something we can just summon. It happens on its own. I don’t think he’ll be upset at you even if it stays that way. If he truly cares about you, he’ll make sure you are comfortable and not put you through pain.

Yall are so invalidating if yall got naturally dry coochies and never want to fix it than that’s your issue ! But don’t expect her to deal with menopause symptoms when she’s not in menopause (assuming) . It take a toll on your confidence and every thing when you’re young this should be a once in every now and then but for the most part you shouldn’t need it . I’m currently attempting to fix the issue myself . And guess who has been my biggest enemies on the situation ? OTHER WOMEN. The competition and dismissal and invalidation is ridiculous although a lot of us know we are the most neglected in healthcare and this is a health issue yall didn’t want to fight to fix for yourselves! This is exactly why the healthcare system neglects us because we don’t fight for ourselves we rather neglect ourselves and use chemicals that make us worse like bc,lube, or any fucking chemical they put in us . No one speaks up so ts keeps happening.  But not for me no more . I been fighting with these bitch ass doctors and reporting to the medical board etc because mfs is too young to be pretty much dealing with menopause without actually being in menopause , vaginal dryness one of the main Symptoms of ts . The only support I see on here is those who were kind enough to offer this woman actually potential solutions and of the ones who questioned if she’s going into menopause because they are real ones 💯❤️ hopefully we will live in a day where women really support one another instead of faking like they do . Done with my speech now lol . Bye . Ohhh my suggestion would be is to get all your sex hormones and vitamin d checked . Hopefully you don’t need estrogen because they’ll give you a hard time and try to stomp out your confidence more but don’t let them , fight until you get what you need if that’s the case .

1ckfcot,"I took a hyaluronic acid supplement alongside collagen for several months and it completely helped me become lubricated again after the off/on months of a dry spell I previously had because the Birth control I was on at the time screwed around with my hormone levels just enough to cause those problems even though they were “normal” according to tests my obgyn ran. Thankfully, my doctor is very open minded about supplements and trying different approaches until the issue is resolved. 
You know your body best, if there’s a chance it could be stress from outside the bedroom find a way to address it. If you think it’s something else don’t hesitate to ask a medical professional about it. Slippery Stuff and Sliquid are brands of lines that I’ve found to work whenever it’s needed.. idk if you guys use condoms or not but if your skin is ever irritated or tender sometimes for days after sex it could also be from an allergic reaction to the lubricant or condom itself. That can cause a lack of natural arousal.",Crazy-Room-7459

1ckfcot,That is fin. The thing to note about coconut oil is 1. Some people don’t realize they have a sensitivity to it and have a reaction but 2. Since its an oil it has to be used infrequently because the oil coats the epithelium and prevents the natural ebb and flow of everything which can lead to problems. 1-2 times a weeks isn’t typically an issue but needing a lube more than that and you’d want to use something not oil based,Thelastunicorn80

I’ve also had really good luck with a supplement called Soaking Wet from VB Health / I went from using lube every time to just sometimes depending on the day",zoomers1234
198i9lt,"It’s perfectly normal and common to not be wet/lubricated if you’re aroused. I used to get lubricated in a heartbeat but ever since I started the pill it just doesn’t happen anymore. I would suggest water based lube that’s always helped me. Also I tend to hurt a bit if my partner enters through missionary and it hurts significantly less if I’m on top. So maybe try that, hope it works for you",Anxious_Highlight854

198i9lt,"I had this issue to, I use slippery elm. It’s a pill you can get it off amazon. It’s safe and you can do your research as well if you want but it’s been used for centuries and it comes from a tree and it’s supposed to help with your your stomach and help coat your G.I. tract. But it also can be used to help you be more wet. I usually take about two pills before intercourse, and it helps a lot with me being more lubricated and not having friction sores or having painful sex, but it does make you extremely wet.",Honest_Basket_1620
198i9lt,"So I’ve also struggled with this and the following have helped me:

1. Visit a Doctor to make sure you don’t have any underlying infections of anything like BV which can cause your vagina to be inflamed making sex more painful.
2. Do a lot foreplay first and
use lube to minimise dryness and micro tears (which will cause more pain)
3. Relax. Breathe before you have sex and try to calm down/make yourself less tense as if you’re tense you’ll tense up down there too. 
4. If you can get a dildo and practise inserting on yourself as it’ll help with the tightness but please don’t force it in, just do it at your own pace until you get used to it. Try to do this regularly as it’ll get you used to the feeling.
5. If it doesn’t improve after all this i’d say see a Dr as it could be something else you don’t know about. 

Good luck, you’ve got this :)",DojaSnack15

198i9lt,"Be careful with birth control in a long run. I used to be on it and heard a lot of stories of women losing their libido and I thought “oh, it doesn’t seem to affect me the same”. But after half a year I, to my surprise, noticed that I have zero sex drive and I never get wet, even when I’m horny and in the motion lol. And my fiancé started telling me that I don’t act like myself. Basically, I lost all my emotions?? Hahah it sounds weird, but yeah, I went from very emotional horny woman to a robot. I stopped birth control and it took me several months to get back to my normal self. Ofc it’s just my experience and all birth control differs, but be careful, because it might worsen your problem.",Strict-Debate-9572
198i9lt,"The pill causes painful sex and a lot of other urogenital tract problems.  That dryness is caused by insufficient estrogen and testosterone, the pill suppresses them and restricts bioavailability.  Believe it or not, we need sex hormones to be readily available to the entire urinary tract and genital tissues for normal functioning, so suppressing them can cause problems.",AkseliAdAstra

198i9lt,"Use coconut oil for lube. It's safe and also soothing. If you are using condoms with it, use polyurethane condoms (non-latex) as oil based lubricants can break down latex. Also, you could be having a reaction to latex, so you could ditch that altogether and get non latex. I like the SKYN brand.",Repulsive_Way326
198i9lt,"My go to lube for painful sex due to dryness is V Magic balm. It’s thick and gluggy and like a strong holding grease (think industrial !). But can’t be used with condoms. 

You sound like you would also benefit from an estrogen cream.

1bvmt73,"So please pause penetrative sex until this is resolved.  There is so much intimacy availible that does not have to hurt your body.  When I'm working with painful sex (I'm a sex coach), it's part figuring out what's wrong and healing the body, and a different part just re-defining what sex is so that intimacy can flourish with total respect for the body's ""no!"" 

My first thoughts are: 

Get a hormonal test done.  Something that uses urine or saliva.  Blood test alone won't do it.  See what that tells you about your body's situation.  You also want to test for cortisol.  Functional medicine doctor might be the place to get this care. 

You  might be having an autoimmune response (like lichens sclerosis).  You'll need to see a specialist for that.  But as you wait to figure out who to see and get off the waitlist, look at your life and figure out what you can do to reduce your day to day stress.  Say ""no"" to things you don't want to do.  Add in some vagus toning exercise to your day every day.  How's your sleep?  Prioritize it.  Physiological stress is the enemy, so do everything in your power to reduce stress right now and see if your vagina responds. 

To protect and treat and moisturize, try castor oil.  It increases blood flow to the area which can help with healing. 

Talk to your vagina.  (I know this sounds silly, but stay with me!)  Is there anything that your body is trying to tell you through this pain?  Check in every day.  If you need to, get a sex coach or a therapist to help with anything that comes up. 

35 is young for perimenopause, but it is possible, especially if you've lived a stressful life.  Surgery of any kind is a stress on the body, so that counts as stress and could have pushed you over the edge.  Is your doctor aware of this? If not, please do call and discuss!

[Existing medical trials](https://www.nordic.com/healthy-science/probiotics-how-many-billion-cfu-do-i-need-to-maintain-daily-digestive-health/#:~:text=Although%20the%20vast%20majority%20of,billion%20are%20becoming%20increasingly%20common.) indicate that probiotic doses of 10-20 billion CFU per day are sufficient for maintaining immune and digestive health

Plain greek yogurt, sauerkraut and other fermented foods are the best probiotics as they may be more bioavailable. For example, a tablespoon serving of sauerkraut weighs roughly ten grams, which means it could give you between 10 million to 10 billion CFUs, and the probiotic content of yogurt products can range from 90 billion to 500 billion CFU per serving

*Lactobacillus acidophilus* is the most-researched strain of probiotic when it comes to establishing and maintaining a healthy vaginal biome. Two other important strains include *lactobacillus rhamnosus* and *lactobacillus reuteri.* If you choose to take a capsule, make sure these are among the strains included",plump0p
18x4jbr,"I was told by the folks at Evvy (which is a vaginal microbiome test) that Crispatus is an important strain to have in there. I take [this Azo one](https://azoproducts.com/products/azo-complete-feminine-balance-daily-probiotic-capsules?selling_plan=484081713) and like it a lot, but I didn't actually turn my vaginal microbiome around until I started doing probiotics vaginally. You can transfer Azo to a vegetable capsule and insert vaginally, or there is [Vitanica](https://vitanica.com/online-store/v-probiotics-30-suppository-capsules/) or [VagiBiom](https://store.vagibiom.com/products/vaginal-probiotic-suppository-natural) already made as suppositories.

I think somewhat different strains might be more helpful for IBS (like saccharomyces boulardii), but there may be a probiotic out there that encompasses it all!",sun_sea_823

* Probiotics targeted for vaginal health: Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus gasseri
* Prebiotics: Fructooligosaccharide, Lactoferrin
* Vitamins and minerals for vaginal health: Vitamin D3, Vitamin E, Zinc

If you're looking for a suppository instead of an oral probiotic, then PurO3 probiotic suppositories are a great option - it has multiple strains of probiotics for vaginal health.",supplement-info

But now that I’m pregnant I can’t use the boric acid and am going to try only probiotics.

Turns out all I needed was probiotics, I notice a huge difference when I forget to take them and I read it can take 6 months of consistent use for you not to need them anymore. I use garden of life vagina oral probiotics. I’m still in the process of recolonizing my vagina ! So I still have to take them… if I don’t my pssy goes to all hell lol I also inserted a gel containing lactic acid ONLY for 7 days And that helped TREMENDOUSLY!

In my walk with Him there have been times I am like “God this doesn’t make sense”, I question, but He is always compassionate and patient. Jesus healed a woman in the Bible with “female issues” and I believe that means He wants to heal you.

16mput6,"Had a copper IUD put in a little over 10 years ago. I’ll never forget how the nurse practitioner gave me no pain control, gave me no warning or consultation on what to expect, and then callously questioned my state because I was screaming and crying in pain practically clawing myself off the exam table…she asked me what was so painful. I had to call my aunt to pick me up and take me home. Aunt is a nurse and was furious with the NP for not even prescribing post-procedure pain control after I begged for relief. Fortunately my aunt was having none of this NP’s shit and raised a bit of hell (worked at the same hospital-called up the supervising physician who prescribed). Extraordinarily traumatic.

So, a week ago I was at the same practice under a different provider’s care to have it removed. That NP *still* worked there. I called her out by name
every chance I got on how barbaric and callous she was. The OBGYNs (a new generation) now routinely anesthetize, prescribe medication, and do ultrasound guided insertions.

16mput6,"I was 19 years old (23 now) when I got a copper iud inserted at Kaiser. I’ve never had children and it was inserted by a nurse practitioner. I was a lot younger and was just so adamant about not having children and focusing on school so I decided on taking the extra protection from having them. I had the nexplanon in my arm prior to the iud insertion. I did not want to be on hormones anymore and paragard was the only non-hormonal option unfortunately. They numbed my arm with a shot on for the removal and while it was getting numb she prepped and inserted the iud. (No numbing or anything) 

When I tell you I was SCREAMING….. I wasn’t given and pre-visit instructions (taking advil, OTCS, etc..) I went in completely sober with no painkillers at all. It hurt so so so so bad, nothing like I’ve ever felt before. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and this humbled me very quickly. I went pale and was shivering afterwards and needed water, almost fainted. I felt completely violated. 

Since that visit, I have not stepped foot in a gyno office—I didn’t even go back for the post-insertion checkup a month later. I did not care and was traumatized. I get hounded by the staff anytime I make a call to Kaiser for something unrelated and they always remind me it’s time for a Pap smear and when I tell you I SHIVER…. I would literally have to be put to sleep or at least on a Xanax or  something to get even a routine exam done now. Everyone at Kaiser looks at me like I’m crazy when I tell them to sedate me and it usually shuts them up and they drop the subject. 

I’m so sick of the US and the crappy healthcare system. Anasthesia should be 100% required for an iud insertion, ESPECIALLY if they patient has now had children. It’s so offensive that they don’t consider how much pain these type of things actually are for women and they just laugh it off or act like we’re dramatic. I’m so happy you had a wonderful experience abroad, I hope one day every woman can feel that level of comfort when receiving medical care!",deuceyy
16mput6,General anesthesia seems too much for an IUD insertion in my opinion but the lack of any pain relief is crazy to me. They didn’t even tell me to take an ibuprofen before my IUD insertion and that was one of the most painful procedures I ever had. Even my colposcopy was less painful.

16mput6,"I use the IUD as a ""medical device"" to treat severe PMDD. I can't function without it so it's the only motivating factor to continue getting my cervix UFCed. I have to change it out sooner than the recommended time as the hormones are less strong over time. I'm on the 5th one. It has been absolutely painful every time except for the first time. I just had one done this weekend. I was sobbing in pain. It is one of the most painful things I've ever experienced and I had tonsillectomy a few years ago. They at least gave me a heating pad for the cramping this time and let me lay there for 5 minutes before seeing if I could get up. I went to planned parenthood instead of the regular gyno. The regular gyno just goes in hot without anything at all then kicks you out right afterwards. 

Two IUDs ago the strings went up the cervix canal. They would have to basically dig the strings out. I had a really low income, so I was on subsidized healthcare (Obamacare). My options were in the office with my copay of $6 (which is unheard of inexpensive for a copay for specialist btw) OR I could get anesthesia and it'd be $700 + the cost of the anesthesia so something around $1,500+. It literally was either get BIG tortured for $6 or possibly not being able to eat/pay rent for the next month. I took the torture option because I couldn't afford the humane one. They gave medication to dilate my cervix which omg that was terrible too!!!! But the good thing was the string came back out so it just went back to normal torture levels. I did learn from that experience you can request Valium but the doctors usually are very reluctant to give it to you. My prior gyno before PPhood seemed annoyed and gave me a prescription for ONE pill!!! On the bottle it says take 1-2 before the procedure.

On my PPhood feedback I wrote a little mini essay about why do they still torture women with the IUD insertion without any numbing options or better pain management. It seriously does not make sense.",Chubbs858

Was just a room not a hospital and I had no pain relief apart from jelly which didn't work. Afterwards I had contractions that had me screaming on the floor in pain for 4 hours. I am now having to pay to go private and have the wrong one replaced with an actual Mirena under sedation or general anaesthesia. Absolutely shocking and I've been left totally traumatized.

In about 3 years I had 7 IUDs placed, and rejected, before giving up… largely because my insurance wouldn’t cover another attempt.

16mput6,"I literally just got the paraguard IUD, in America, yesterday, in my drs office.  It’s 3 mm larger than mirena from my understanding.  (I also had the mirena 6 years ago, but it wasn’t right for me, nor do I remember much pain with insertion for that either.)  I’m 30 and have never had a child or been pregnant.  When reading about the insertion of the paraguard prior to my appointment, I started getting really nervous because women were saying it’s so much pain, they were ill afterwards, etc. like I said, I didn’t remember mirena being very painful, but it had been a while and I thought maybe the slight size difference was a factor.  It was a little uncomfortable and some pressure, but there’s no way I would need anesthesia for that at all, and any “pain” if I’d even call it that, was only for a split second when the thing went through my actual cervix.  I was completely fine immediately afterwards.  I had a bit of cramping when I got home, but today feel fine.  I know we are all different with pain tolerance, but it’s really not that bad.  I seriously question what the drs are actually doing in Greece while your under anesthesia (which has its own set of risks) when the entire insertion took my dr less than 10 min… possibly less than 5.  Seems like a huge waste of time and extra stress on the body to have to basically pretend your undergoing a major operation to get a piece of plastic shoved up your vagina… 
Of course just my opinion, and everyone’s body reacts in a unique way, I just have a really hard time believing some of these women gave birth to children without an epidural, yet they have to be knocked out to get an IUD.

16mput6,"Not an expert but so far I really like it. I think the quality is better and the price super cost effective. 

So public hospital are generally free or you just pay an extremely low price usually for the cost of some consumable. For example before I was enrolled in the Greek health care system. I twisted my ankle got an X-ray at a public hospital and paid 4 euros for the cost of the paper. In America that would be 500$ after insurance. 

When you work and pay taxes you get enrolled in the Greek health care called EKA (sp). If you don’t work and pay taxes your not covered with ELA. 

So in this system any prescription w EKA is basically covered for free. Medications are free. For example the Merina IUD is 140 euros out of pocket w a prescription and enrolment in the Greek eka system it is free. 

Dr visit at there office are not free (in the hospital with EKA it is free) but only around 20-50 euros. 

Also any testing or blood work or things that are done at specialises clinics you pay out of pocket. Which I find ridiculously low. Or if you have EKA they can be free or greatly reduced.

Also, maybe reach out to  US based podcasts that discuss women’s health, or a popular person who covers the news on youtube. Both can get the info out & likely be able to dig for info to support your story. 

I’m suggesting ask this just to talk about this IUD information. If you have any other anecdotes that could be fact checked, I’m sure there would be interest, but like I said, the IUD is a hot topic on TT, and that’s a great place to start.",Tumbleweeddownthere
16mput6,"This actually makes me sooo mad! In Canada, healthcare is free aside from prescriptions. But we still are forced to do the painful in clinic office IUD insertion. My Dr just told me to take an Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen 10 minutes before. As if that does anything for the fact that they're dilating your cervix with a hollow rod.
The fact that they CAN do it under general anesthesia and just don't actually makes me rage!
When I had my second one removed, the strings were gone inside so they had to go inside my cervix and uterus to fish it out. Dr said ""oh maybe you'll need surgery"" and then the Gyn just fished for it for almost two hours anyways! Like we can't even have anesthesia for when they literally go INSIDE of an organ!? This subject angers me to no end! 😡😞

However! I'm very glad you got to have a great experience to have it inserted, because it truly was a wonderful BC method. ♥️

By LAW (but it doesn't apply in many situations) an employer in the U.S. has to offer 12 weeks of UNPAID maternity leave. Paid maternity leave is not required. Many women can't afford to take the full 12 weeks.

I had a friend who in week 6 of new motherhood got a rather aggressive letter from her employer. Hewlett Packard made it clear that if she didn't return in 6 weeks she would be fired.

I should not have driven myself home, I as I was very close to crashing my car. Why is this okay? As for the coughing you refer to, that was for the procedure of them removing it.

Bruh. I have to wait 7 months for a neuro ophthalmologist, 6 months to see a neurologist in the US... the list goes on. In America, not only do you have to wait for specialists, but you pay out the ass for the privilege.

Back when I was on my parents insurance, I went to the ER with a high week-long fever. They did a lumbar puncture to test for meningitis, put an IV in me, and eventually discharged me. I remember my stepdad complaining about the $2000 bill (with insurance that gets taken out of his paycheck).

16mput6,"Good observation. Thing is, Americans have quite a few revenue streams going from taxes to healthcare provision.

Medicare. Medicaid. VA. IHA. CHIP. CDC. Then there is all the public employees who get health insurance on the public purse. Thats 1 in 7 people in the US workforce. Then there are tax breaks for employers purchasing healthcare.

All in all over half the people in the US gets healthcare funded by taxes.

Now, what you have surely noted already is that some of the larger groups there, Medicare and Medicaid, covers by far the most expensive patient groups. The VA patients on the average have seen some shit. CHIP patients are a little more expensive than average. In total, the minority that does not get public healthcare in the US is the cheapest group -working age adults healthy enough to hold down a job. And the uninsured.

Thats why most of the astronomical healthcare spending in the US is borne by the taxpayer. They just don't get any kind of UHC system out of it.",Zamaiel

But I also know women who have had a topical painkiller for this and said it did nothing for them. The point is this isn’t a simple issue. There are medical issues the experts know about and we don’t, and there are down sides to the proposed solutions that aren’t being taken into account, and individual biology that also needs to be taken into account.

The penis is more functional in regards to human reproduction. The clitoris itself does not aid to giving birth/produce sperm. It’s purpose is for pleasure. Pleasure is not the major concern of anatomy. That’s why it is not as detailed as the penis (a shame... but honestly speaking makes sense why there’s so much more about the penis. More stuff to describe regarding the internal parts and functioning). More specialized books however do go into depth as pleasure is more of a topic in reproduction. But on a baseline, most books do not concern themselves with it.

Having said that, shit happens. Knowledge only helps. Having the diagram in books that are often referenced--particularly for doctors entering the military or operating overseas in impoverished areas--would be beneficial.

YES, SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. The sexual organs do exist for sexual intercourse--in order to reproduce. The pleasure is involved to facilitate the longevity of the human race. One without the other has no purpose. Without the penis, no gametes transfer.

eeu6k2,"Omg the amount of people misinterpreting what you said is astounding. As a female medical student, I understand the dilemma a bit in detail. The clitoris is an important part of a woman’s sex organ regarding pleasure. Anatomy books often don’t offer too much about the pleasure aspect of things, besides “engorgement of blood with stimulation and arousal”. 


The clitoris is lacking detail in basic anatomy books due to the lesser medical function than the vagina/vulva/etc (which has much more information)... Yes I agree that it’s a shame that more textbooks don’t offer more information on the clitoris! But it’s not because the penis is more glorified. Rather from what I’ve experienced as a prospective surgeon, the penis is more described and depicted due to its different parts internal to the penis, which is what anatomically speaking, is “important” for our survival. The clitoris itself is a bundle of nerve endings, and books will reference that, but it itself contains no significant tubes, spongy tissue (reacting with chemical NO), urinary tract, etc. More specialized books will however address the clitoris more in detail :)

Sexual activity results in reproduction but that is not the function of the external sexual organs, the only part of the human body specifically for reproduction is the cells that create the gametes. They're two separate things.

As a surgeons daughter, I knew surgery could go wrong. I didn’t understand it was due to medical negligence. 

Because I was only 18 and a virgin, I did not understand the importance of clitoral sensation to female sexual function. I did not even know what a clitoris was. I just knew all my external sensation was gone from a surgery I signed up for, which they told me went well.

I do see your point. I did struggle for years to talk about it, especially because people would blame me or ask what the big deal was. I also feared being seen as a pervert. I also struggled to explain it and to be believed. At first, people told me they were sure that didn’t happen, that I just needed to relax, fall in love, etc. I did get to a point where I was afraid to see more doctors about it.

I thought I had an unrelenting yeast infection back in 2020 until I finally learned it was actually vulvodynia and the things I was doing to try to self-treat were making it worse.

If you're certain it's a yeast infection, lactobacillus crispatus vaginal suppositories can be really helpful getting things back in balance.

Once I learned that you should never put soap on ur vag i obv stopped doing that but I wasn’t about to just stop using soap in the shower all together. My friend told me the only thing that ever helped her condition was organic goats milk soap(usually found in farming towns at the market n stuff) because it’s hydrating and also has natural stuff in it that helps your vag keep a healthy PH balance by introducing more good bacteria and kickin out all the bad guys. My yeast infections are always extremely mild to the point that swabs can never pick them up-I’ve had tests for BV n every STI/STD- so the only noticeable problem I have when it flares up is that goddamn itching. Goats milk soap clears it up sooo fast and it’s crazy soothing for the pain cuz I can’t help but scratch it raw-idk if that’s tmi -don’t put it directly on your vag but wash your body with it and try your best not to get any hair products flowing down there if ur in the shower. I wish you luck and I feel your pain.

19ehnko,"You should first try to see a doctor who can give you a prescription for an antifungal called fluconazole to be taken every 2-3 days for a long course (I did 6 months). Or, if you can't see a doctor, you could try a long (LONG!) course of boric acid. You can use it nightly for quite a long time. I did an 8 month course, directed by my doctors at a special clinic for vulvar and vaginal disorders. Someone else on here did a 6 month course and I think it took 2-3 months for her chronic yeast to finally resolve, but it did. If the yeast seems like it has gone away, keep using it for a while just to make sure you've gotten rid of any vestiges. Then, you can use probiotic suppositories afterwards to replenish the bacteria.

Someone here said to try steroids, but I wanted to tell you that my doctor specifically said not to use a topical steroid unless it's combined with a topical antifungal. The steroids are an immunosuppressant and can allow the yeast grow even stronger unless it's combined with an antifungal.",imeanlikenothing

Every doctor I saw would prescribe fluconazole. Eventually I was referred to an infectious disease doctor that tested my yeast to see what anti fungal will work. The results came back and my yeast was resistant to all anti-fungals except for a IV infusion medication. My doctor ended up sending me to an infusion clinic to get anti-fungal infusions for 10 days.

19ehnko,"Fuck yes to this. I totally noticed a change when I was cutting out refined sugars and gluten (I guess really anything that has sugars in it at this point..) and that seemed to help me a lot. It’s hard to pinpoint what exactly was the cause for me because I was also trying to strictly eat vegan at the time too, eating as basic as possible which is honestly pretty rough considering OP posted earlier biggest food source being pasta/ carbs, especially when affordable in the US. I also noticed a huge difference in my acne, almost disappearing. I also would have to mention, when I stopped using laundry detergent and fragrances near my vagina at all, that could have been a factor in my yeasties stopping for a while. STRESS STRESS STRESSS is also a major cause of flares with recurring infections (at least for me) so I really cannot say whether or not diet controlled them, because I also was going through so many other changes to nip it in the bud. As others have mentioned as well, it is such a long process of trial and error so OP if you can, eliminate single factors at a time to see what works for you.

19ehnko,"You did read that correctly and I’m always so relived when this message hits the right person. Yeast is so prevalent that people think this is an easy thing to cure when it’s chronic but to be clear, it’s fighting a literal colony. A true invasion will take a long time but sugar is the main source of fuel for yeast. There is absolutely no textbook cure, no tips, no shortcuts.. there is no pill, no drink nothing. When people ask for this type of remedy it just reminds me of how under funded and under educated we all are (especially western doctors) about the severity of candida. 

Stress and diet are the only solutions to discover recovery. Food is critical in this journey. I am so sorry to say to OP but living off carbs is probably why her family as she mentioned all suffer from YI with other areas of stress factor in. 

You must absolutely find alternatives. I eat pasta but only whole grain gluten free  (can find a box here for less than $3. I eat rice but only whole grain gluten free (more expensive but like $10 for 2.2kg) you cannot eat sugar. This sub will hate anything to do with sacrificing and not the simple action of taking a pill - this is due to lack of education on the subject and western medicine influence. 

It’s a serious condition that requires serious intervention. You will not find many or any helping hands in the matter. It really is self discovery, intense forced discipline. It’s a complete overhaul of your current situation. Money is absolutely a factor in ensuring you can feed yourself properly in order to literally starve the yeast. There is tons of research available online but only you can do this for yourself. I’ve read books, spent countless hours reading and researching. It may feel hopeless because there isn’t enough guidance but you can do this. You just need to understand your body and that’s where the hard work comes in. 

I hope you understand you’re not alone and there are so many women like you and me that just want help and a fix but it’s not that easy. It will take work and time. Get your mindset right, scour for healthy foods you can afford and stay the frick away from sugar. Limit your carbs. Meat and veggies are everything right now. It’s your main pattern. No more juice or coffee. Just water. I haven’t heard of anyone ever healing chronic Candida with anti fungals alone. They are a tool - your actions are the cure.",loopylavender

19ehnko,"Thank you! I asked my doctor the last time I saw him in January and he told me to resume the boric acid and to cut back on sugar, which are only temporary solutions (not the sugar part; too much sugar and starch are bad). Luckily, I see him next Tuesday and will push very hard for the IV infusions until he says yes. I’ve had glabrata for over a year. Before that it was resistant albicans. The problem is when you tell certain doctors that the antifungals aren’t working, they don’t listen and up the dosage. I definitely understand the depression piece. Chronic infections/diseases are exhausting especially when they affect you so personally. 

Regarding the infusions, did you have to take time off of work? What was the process like? I don’t care if it’s time consuming. I can ask for an accommodation at work.",AnaisJames
19ehnko,"Hey there :) it’s definitely possible and frankly very likely your doctor used that phrase, it came back because candida isn’t looked at as a dangerous living thing because it naturally exists inside all of us. It’s not something that can truly be eradicated as it’s needed as a functional part of the gut and human skin. Men and women have candida but a healthy person isn’t affected nor even is aware of it. So many strains exist and that furthers the misunderstanding of how truly difficult this thing is. The moment a doctor recognizes it’s become chronic (4 or more a year) the candida protocol should change to focus on diet and lifestyle but no, they’ll give you the fluconazole protocol - lack of awareness of how to actually treat things cause - pills! It’s a joke. I’ve spent years working on this and I’m genuinely considering making a career out of this because it’s a serious problem. Just look at this sub.. at least 10 posts a day on chronic YI and no solutions. It requires an insane amount of discipline and focus and frankly, privilege to afford the correct path of healing inside out. I hope you find your healing and take yourself seriously enough to get better! You can do it if you try!",loopylavender
19ehnko,"Maybe. Just make sure when you get tested it’s through a PCR swab by them swabbing your vaginal fluids. I had BV where my symptoms didn’t completely go away l ended up testing positive for mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma.

I have also come on my period in a coffee shop and there was leakage onto the chair, and also on a plane with no pads or tampons with bad leakage!

Moral of the story is always to carry an emergency pad or tampon in your bag.",NJW_90

lsqk5m,"This happened to me back in December, about a month after I started my job. I got my period and didn’t have a tampon or pad on me or in my car. I asked my work friend—who I had met on my first day—if she had anything I could use, and she said no. She suggested I ask around, but since I hadn’t been working there long and had only ever spoken to like 8 coworkers I didn’t feel comfortable asking people I didn’t know for a tampon. About 20 minutes later my friend came back with a tampon for me. Turns out she went around during her break and asked all of our female coworkers that she could find until she found me a tampon. She made a potentially terrible day a lot better.",pnwseasalt
lsqk5m,"Oof. I hate the word “oof” but it aptly describes the annoying sentiment. All periods suck but let me tell you a story to commiserate: 

It was October 2012. My mother invited my bf and I to come to Thanksgiving to celebrate my aunt’s promotion as president of an Ivy League University (details not necessary). We dutifully arrived to my aunt’s new estate which somehow came with the new job. Many people, strangers etc were present. So rewind - I realized 3 hours into the train ride that not only had I left my glasses, but also that my period came 3 days earlier than my app said it would! I...I tried my best during those sorrowful crotch hours lol. The bathroom toilet paper would only last 4 minutes. My pants were brand new and kind of cute. I ended up literally bleeding out onto my new pants at the age of 29. My mother called and I just begged her to buy pads. She was amazing. New pants, new pads. If she wasn’t there for me? The giant dinner party would been humiliating. Being female with a period is basically like playing a video game but on the “hard” setting. Not cool at all.",aapaul
lsqk5m,i felt this! i remember one time in 2014 when i was at six flags with my family and family friends and i was feeling so weird all day not knowing i had started my period. i felt the wetness and knew what it was...and i went to the bathroom to confirm. when it was time to swim i was asked if i wanted to put in a tampon so i could swim but i had no idea how to put in a tampon so i opted for a pad and sat on the bench while everyone else went to swim. i was so mad :-( i was like 13 and my mom never told me about tampons or how to put them in.,pixieyosi
lsqk5m,"I once started and knew nothing about it for a couple of hours until the cramps really kicked in. I suspected and rummaged around for a pad but all I had was a pathetic liner that's great when you're almost finished but not so much when you've been flowing for a while.

I had to call my mum to come and drop me some pads off. And some fresh undies.",skullsandcrosses
lsqk5m,This legit just happened to me last weekend. I didn't have any of my stuff or money to go buy tampons and nobody at work had anything. I had to wait to go on my break (it was towards the end of my shift) to run home and get my stuff. It wasn't a good day,_undead_assassin

lsqk5m,"Do you have such a heavy flow every period, or is this the first time this had happened? I would recommend you go to a professional to check this out, this sounds like WAY too much bleeding compared to a normal period.",Littl3Monster
lsqk5m,"Lol, totally agree! Maybe there were machines that provide pads in the bathroom and I haven't noticed, I was like 13 back then. Could have asked from someone to borrow a pad, but my mom was old school and taught me no one should know I menstruate (today I literally announce when I'm bleeding), so I didn't and just rolled a bunch of toilet paper. I really have no idea how that toilet paper survived the flight.",Littl3Monster

I felt the gush as we were getting into the airport. I tried using toilet paper and on the longer flight I asked my mom if I could have the isle seat but she wouldn't let me so I couldn't get out easily. By the time I had the opportunity to get up to use the restroom, I was already petrified I left blood on the seat. When we landed I finally told my mom I had got my period and we found a bathroom for me to change (luckily I was wearing black leggings though). My mom had to ask a security agent for quarters to get a pad for me. Most stressful traveling experience of my life.",katybugita

My sister just started hers not long ago, she has a bit of problems with flow and irregularities herself... Just in case, having a professional to look at your situation won't do any harm.

lsqk5m,"I'll be 29 this year, I've been having periods for a loooong time. Lol. Only things I can think of are 1) I had a baby last year, so I could still be regulating after that and 2) I recently started taking antidepressants and that could be messing with my hormones? Oh, also I was anemic during my pregnancy, but doc said that cleared up after my son was born. I'll get checked out tomorrow if it hasn't slowed down by tonight; I just don't want to drag my baby out to the doctor/er if I don't have to with covid going around and all.",sapc2
lsqk5m,"I don't know she's always made us sit on the inside seat. In planes, in restaurant booths, on the bus. To keep us safer I guess? I maybe she just really doesn't like being squished.",katybugita
lsqk5m,"Lol, sorry for thinking you were a youngster, I just assumed it from personal experience. From what I learned (nursing student here), breastfeeding is more of a factor when it comes to having a period after your birth, but I don't know if it has any effect on the amount of bleeding directly.
I don't really remember what affect antidepressants have on the menstrual cycle, I guess it depends on which kind, but a quick Google search (gotta love the internet) shows it can have affects on on the amount of bleeding! So if you want or it bothers you, you can totally consult you doctor about it, and he/she can recommend if you need to maybe switch up your medication or change the dosage.
Being anemic from pregnancy it totally normal, many become anemic since the fetus literally drains the mother's iron supply (which is why it is recommended to take iron supplements), but also heavy bleeding can cause it as well.
I totally understand why you don't want drag your baby all the way to the doctors office, especially now. Do they have the option of having a phone-in appointment? If they have that option, it could save you the trip.
I'm sorry for this looking like I'm trying to push you to see your doctor, it's just that I've encountered so many girls (and people in general) who don't take something abnormal seriously enough, or think that it's nothing, and then having bad outcomes from it. Safe to say, it is always better to be safe than sorry :)",Littl3Monster
lsqk5m,I think it bc she don’t want to be squished lol.,aapaul
lsqk5m,"No need to apologize, I really appreciate all your advice. I was starting to worry. I just know I usually slow down about day 3-4, so I don't want to overreact if it's just gonna taper off anyway. I'm definitely keeping a close eye on it though.",sapc2

I think about 3-4 cm long and 2 cm across is a fair estimate of the one in the picture, not counting the fallopian tubes and ovaries. A typical uterus should be more like 8x5 cm, so it's like half the ""typical"" size in two dimensions I understand that people can have variation (I have no idea what the normal size curve is,) and there are lots of reasons to have the bits removed, but I highly suspect this is abnormal.

In my defence I think it helps to put the thing you’re maintaining in perspective when you actually have an idea what it looks like.

So in seeing the actual uterus rather than a diagram (kind of like when you see real lungs or dissect a pigs heart in science class) you are able to actually think about the processes going on inside you in a different way rather than just seeing a diagram.

10zutxs,"Y’all. 

Are some of y’all really saying that even the *idea* of a neovagina being discussed here threatens our safe space?

I’ve seen them discussed here in the wild maybe once. Vast majority of the discussion here already IS centered around natal vaginas. Saying discussion is allowed is not “centering” or “favoring” them. 

Nothing is lost or sacrificed by being inclusive. 

What prompted this post is the increasing amount of hateful rhetoric I’m seeing toward both trans men and women here. That will not and never has been tolerated.

I’ve been with way too many guys that threw my ph off only to find out that they were community d!ck, were slack about brushing their teeth every day, or didn’t wash their balls or bums when they showered. One guy I found out would jerk off and just pull his boxers back up without even cleaning it off! When I flipped out he was legit like “what? It dries.” (Needless to say I ghosted that one).

Yea telling the man to wash n clean isn't romantic...but like what the hell is wrong with them, why can't they do on their own!!!
After work n house work, cooking n cleaning n cry kids, a romantic evening is another headache because of the repercussions of their hygiene.
This is even after we traumatize our body with birth control when they being snipped would be much easy n convenient.

And they complain about our low libido...honestly solo pleasure is just the best.

Also I had horrible cramps until I had my first kid. Then nothing for 7 years. Then I had my second one and they came back with a vengeance.  I know a few other women with had their cramps lessen or go away completely after they had a child. So if you decide to do that in a few years or whenever is good for you..it might be a little bonus lol

Also old brown blood is all that is. The route from the uterine walls to the vaginal opening isn't a straight up and down line. Especially with sitting and laying and basic normal things, so what happens is little drops basically get stuck in crevices or whatever and that's why they get old and turn brown and come out after the period ends sometimes. Someone put that it got better with the cup and that's because it basically sucks to the cervix and collects period tissue and blood so the droplets aren't going into the vaginal canal and getting caught up anywhere.

For sure keep using lots of lube. What type of lube do you use? I find that silicon based lubes work best for me",PM_ME_PIKS
1913kos,"Mostly I want to give internet hugs and empathy. That knife feeling I know alllll too well and have had it on and off for a decade+. Granted I do believe mine has a base in anxiety/SA. Lately I was thinking I may have a yeast infection as well and sex ended up being nauseatingly bad. Usually I can put up with the pain enough to keep my partner happy but this was BAD. 

Anyway, is it your regular doc you’re seeing? Any women’s health places you could see instead and sooner? Planned Parenthood always treated me with such care and empathy, especially given my history. I saw them many times over investigating my pain issues. 

SSRIs and hormonal birth control can both cause sexual issues, so changing the latter may be on the table earlier. And taking extra extra time with foreplay as well to make sure things are good and ready. 

Also want to recognize that this pain stuff can be a helluva cycle. Fear and memory of the pain can lead to more of it. I don’t have a great solution to that aspect, and right now just deal (which isn’t great, I know).

In regard to treatment for dryness. I’d recommend getting some vitamin E vaginal suppositories. Insert them at night once you are already in bed.

Longer term, you may need a conversation about tapering off or changing your antidepressant. It's not a straightforward decision. So I wouldn't make a knee-jerk reaction. 

In addition to lube, maybe start using a vaginal moisturiser. The water-based vaginal moisturiser from Yes brand is the best I've found, and it doesn't leave a residue like other products.

Pelvic floor physiotherapy could be another beneficial route longer term, too.",WhisperINTJ

I sometimes take 2-3 in the morning and the rest after lunch, and sometimes I forget to take my lunchtime dose and it still works well so you could probably get away with just taking fewer each day! Or it actually doesn’t taste bad so you could open them up and put them in yogurt",PM_ME_PIKS

iof6ts,"I don't personally like the song it's not my thing but I appreciate the women out here actually talking about that stuff and sex in the ways that male artists have talked about it for years.

We are making progress as a society normalizing the we fact that women like sex, and we as all genders should talk about sex and be informed. My biggest problem with Ben Shapiro was not the fact he hated the song but he pushed the idea that women should be wet or discharge without a medical condition. We should be actively pushing to normalize talking about sex and sexual health people need to know this stuff.",L0llip0pChainsaw
iof6ts,Vaginas are amazing and I’m glad this song is celebrating sexuality. Cardi B escaped domestic violence by becoming a stripper and now she’s a multi millionaire who doesn’t care if you don’t like how she is sexy and she knows she is. I applaud her.,Staycurious1996

I enjoy the dialogue it has sparked. The song is funny and sexy and I have had it stuck in my head for like 3 days. It's not degrading to anyone and people who are upset about it should calm down, realize it's not for them, then move on...And then do some soul searching for why they think having a wet vagina when you're turned on is a bad thing.",imsobadatnames
iof6ts,"Love he song, love the message. The fact that it is getting so much attention is just more reason why it needs to exist - women creating mainstrean content around their own bodies, sexuality, and not settling for anything less than sexual satisfaction should be the norm, not some startling exception. I can get why the explicitness might put some people off (no judgment whatsoever if it does!) but if men are allowed to rap about sex, one night stands, using women for their bodies, getting head, and orgasms then women should be free to do the same.  

TL;DR the song is fire and I'm a stan for sexual liberation. More WAP in the world is a good thing imo.",Turbulent-Tart
iof6ts,"I would much rather listen to a song about a wet coochie than hear a guy rap about his sweaty balls. And it does bring attention to the fact that wetness is normal. Anyone saying that the song is highlighting a medical issue is just so wrong and is taking the obvious hyperbole literally.

I love sex, women enjoying sex should be the norm, not calling us sluts or whores or thots or whatever other bullshit.

iof6ts,"I overall liked the song and the message and the normalization of the fact that women enjoy sex (who would've thought?) and speaking about our bodies as freely as men have spoken about theirs. 

HOWEVER, I feel like having a wet vagina during sex is generally seen as a good/desirable thing. The amount of times I've seen women post on Reddit ""I get really wet when I'm turned on, do guys find it gross??!!!11"" and then thousands of comments from people saying it's really hot etc is pretty high. Or how in porn that's always the norm. Or literature. Which is cool because women like that exist. 

I guess it would be cool to also normalize all the women who are drier, who need lube or aren't a fountain down there. Obviously this doesn't come at the price of invalidating other's bodies though. Just more inclusion of all body types would be cool ig",gedusathemorgon

Cardi is my age (she was born exactly one week before me) and Meg is younger than me, so it makes me so happy to see them celebrating female pleasure. I still encounter men who don't eat pussy or don't care if I get off as long as they do, so this is a conversation that needs to be had and a message that needs to be spread.",KaiSparda
iof6ts,"I like the aesthetics of it, it may not be 100% my thing but the music video is very well put together. Also 'celebrating' wetness is pretty cool, it's something that's very popular among the queer sex-positive circles I'm in but not something that I see in wider places. Being really wet because of arousal is hot, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Also sending your partner a picture of your hand covered in it makes a fun suggestive pic.",oboeplum

I like now that I get to  expect my partner to up their game when it comes to pleasure and that wetness is the AIM. It's the goal and it's celebrated. Song is fun, it's a group fun song.

I don't feel empowered or justified by society's view on my period or my vagina, personally.

I think it really shows. It sounds more like what men think women are like than what they are actually like. Particularly black women. They do not possess insatiable pussy, that's just a harmful stereotype.

But it was only 2 days after my period started, so I thought it was just extremely bad cramps.  I can't sit up because pressure on my abdomen had been the worst pain in my life up to that moment. I couldn't stand for the same reason.  Laying down somehow made it hurt even worse.  I had to sit on my bed, with my ass hovering over the bed while my hands pushed me up, keeping pressure off my belly.  I take 4 advil and a muscle relaxer, as those were the only things I had available at the time. The advil takes affect after about 30 minutes, the muscle relaxant made it so I could sit without my hands propping me up, and within an hour of waking up I was able to go back to sleep.

  
The next morning, as I'm getting to work, I text my mother and tell her about the pain I dealt with, and that I was still feeling sore, but not extreme pain as it had been.  She convinced me to go to the doctor.  So I went to the doctor that afternoon, at which point she and my doctor both start yelling at me for not calling an ambulance.......

Even if the risk of being pregnant falls on biological women, the risk of causing pregnancy falls heavily on biological men and that should not be ignored.

I just had surgery on July 23rd for abnormal uterine bleeding and was diagnosed with endometriosis.  My periods have always been heavy and extremely painful ever since I was 15 and no pain medication ie ibuprofen or advil helps and we've tried several different birth control types including 2 IUDS to no avail . My doctor says that if I ever want children that my only option is IVF. My fallopian tubes are very narrow and blocked.  Because of my current Ob-gyn who I've been seeing since I was 19 ...for almost 9 years now told me that all this was normal and didn't think she needed to deal with it anymore.  I listened to my body and knew that it wasn't normal and my mom who goes to all my appointments has 13 fibroids removed before she had her first child.  She demanded that i be checked for endometriosis and turns out we were right after all. My doctor was blaming it all on the Mirena IUD THAT SHE TALKED ME INTO A YEAR AGO . This was my second surgery.  Listen to your body.  Im glad I did and my mom acted like she had a stick up her butt in order to get her to listen.  I have endometriosis and I go back on August 17th for pathology reports and next steps.  I knew that there was something wrong and something wasn't right especially since I had the same symptoms I did with my first round of polyps and complaining about the same issues.

No pain or cramping tho.  My gp got me a blood test to confirm I was anemic and to take iron. He also got me an appointment with a gyno in the following weeks who took a biopsy and shrugged off these new symptoms that I was pre or peri? Menopausal. I'm 38 delivered twins 4 years ago born extremely premature, but my who life and for the -almost 4 years after delivery have had very regular periods, light to medium 5days max, bitchiness and cramps the 3to 5days before day 1. 

He wanted to schedule me for an IUD touting the main benefit that it could potentially stop my periods and I wouldn't need birth control/protection (because I don't want more kids). I don't know why it took me a few weeks after that appointment to have it sink in and be shocked at what he said to me. A. I'm complaining about these symptoms of my periods not that I don't want it in general. Did he not get that? B. For me and husband our pull out or condoms are fine for us, I don't need nor want some new mode of BC. I especially don't want some object permanently or for the long term inside of me that could possibly mask these concerning symptoms. 

Anyway over the last week speaking with my aunt who told me my paternal grandmother had to get a hysterectomy sometime around menopause because she was shedding clots that was enough to convince me to start taking this seriously again. 

But What The actual EFF. Why is this health system or attitude allow people to doubt themselves and their symptoms? Anyway thank you so much for sharing your story, I'm going to find a doctor who wants to rule out potential illnesses before telling me I'm just pre menopausal.",omgoshsquash

I was a gynae cancer coordinator in England for many years AND I am also a sufferer of endometriosis and have in the past and pre cancerous changes to my cervix, so I have myself also had lots of treatments and surgeries. 

During my career I’ve seen women as young as 18 die of gynaecological cancers who had very few symptoms. People often misunderstand warning signs and presume because they aren’t necessarily in lots of pain that it can be ignored. But no, something that is out of the ordinary should never ever be ignored! And because we are a more sexually active society than of those in the past we are now seeing more and more cases of cervical cancers in the younger generations. So yes ladies, go to the dr with anything abnormal that is happening to you. The likelihood of it being cancer is slim and it will probably be something easily treated, but it’s best to be safe!

My ob/gyn did a pelvic ultrasound (internal and external), repeated the pap test (got the yearly one done on May) and a biopsy. They found a polycyst? (don’t remember the name) on one ovary, a small fibroid, a polyp, and bacterial vaginosis. She said that the fibroid was less than 1/2 an inch and to not even worry about the polyp. She wanted to focus on the biopsy. Apparently my endometrial lining was 1.5 inches thicker than it should be. The results showed that my estrogen levels were very low and the biopsy came back negative. I’ll be turning 34 on Friday.

I was prescribed Provera for 10 days, and i think two forms of (I’m assuming) very strong antibiotics. Yesterday was my last day on Provera for this month. I’m still bleeding. I use a menstrual cup and I’m getting about 1/2 a cup in the 12 hour period.

I have no idea what I have. They just ruled out cancer. My doctor wants to keep me on Provera, 10 days a month, for 3 months. Right now it’s basically, let’s see what happens. My next appointment will be November.

i48i58,"I'm sorry you are being forced to go through this. It sucks. I wish there was something I could say to make it all better, but I know in these situations words are never quite enough.  

As far as advice goes, for what it's worth, here is where I'd start: First, try not to freak out too much until you meet with the oncologist (easier said than done I know). There are many different types, grades, and stages of uterine cancer. Some of them might require a hysterectomy, but that's not always the case. You may have options for preserving your fertility. If not, as heartbreaking as it is, remember your life and health are the priority. However you can't really make any decisions until you have all the information. So try to get that meeting and any necessary scans or tests done as soon as possible. The sooner you get treatment the better your chances of a positive outcome.  

Second, if you're on Facebook I would highly encourage you to join one of the private support groups for uterine and/or endometrial cancers. There are several very active groups with anywhere from 1k-3k members. There you can ask any question, no judgement, and get guidance and sympathy from women who have been through what you're going through. You'll get a lot of good advice on treatment options, medications, surgery recovery, etc. I'm in a couple groups and they have given me a lot of support as well as a wealth of knowledge.  

Third, when it comes to coping there is no one size fits all answer. Personally, I tried my best to stay positive, have a good attitude, practice gratitude, be kind to those around me, and laugh whenever possible. Constantly worrying or being pessimistic, bitter, and angry will just make an already shitty situation that much more miserable - for you and everyone around you. Don't push away the people who love you the most. You'll have good days and bad days and miserable days. Just do the best you can.  

Fourth, this is a very emotional and overwhelming time for you. A lot of women in your shoes go see the doctor and their minds go blank. They can't remember half of the questions they wanted to ask and afterwards they can't remember half of what the doctor said. (Some of the medications they might prescribe down the road can cause memory issues also.) So do yourself a favor and write everything down and maybe even audio record your appointments. Get a notebook. Write down all the questions you want to ask. Write down dates, meds, symptoms you've experienced, treatment options, and anything you know you'll want to research later.  

I really hope they've caught it early and that it is something that can be easily treated. Best of luck to you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything.",digitalvagrant

i48i58,"Age is not a reason to dismiss cancer as a possibility. Being young might mean you are statistically less *likely* to have it, but it still needs to be properly ruled out with actual evidence and testing. I'm a member of an online support group for women under 40 with reproductive cancers, we have over a thousand members, some not even 20 years old. I'm glad you're getting an ultrasound. Hopefully it's nothing too serious, but definitely don't accept ""I don't know"" or ""it's just a blip"" as an answer. Get a second opinion if necessary.",digitalvagrant
i48i58,"Yes definitely worth asking for at least an ultrasound. Birth control pills have a measured dose of estrogen and progesterone that turn off your own production, and would usually prevent an extreme proliferation of the uterine lining as opposed to someone who is producing a bunch of estrogen and not enough progesterone (that’s when you see symptoms like heavy bleeding and clots as the progesterone isn’t keeping the endometrium in check) if you’re still bleeding heavily even while on BCP as for an ultrasound as well as a hormone panel (even if they argue you’re on BCP). Good luck ❤️",None

i48i58,"Always!! My OB-GYN kept brushing off my symptoms 😑 im so glad my mom was with me.  Never stop advocating for yourself.  Even my endocrinologist said that polyps and anything inside or outside the uterus that isn't biopsied and if left alone and untreated will turn into cancer sooner or later. Since I was 15 years old I've suffered from very heavy and extremely painful periods with large blood clots and no diagnosis.  Im 26 now and have a diagnosis.  FINALLY!!  I'm not crazy.

jj2rhu,"My husband is very well endowed and we used to have a hell of a time, even with extended foreplay. A few years ago we figured out that using a cone shaped dildo before sex, generally during foreplay, helps me dilate myself in a gradual way so that I'm able to accommodate him without pain.

We've been using the cone for a couple of years, but unfortunately I needed it before sex every single time for it to not be painful. That is until I learned how to relax my pelvic floor. I started doing reverse kegels and very recently, (both during and outside of sexual activities) I have also started to dilate my booty with small plugs, to further help me learn how to relax my pelvic floor. I hadn't ever really enjoyed anal play before  because I was just so tight but I'm finding it really adds to my pleasure, but even if it didn't, I would still do it because it's helped me so much. 

So yeah, learning to relax my pelvic floor has been a game changer! In fact, the other day we were actually able to have spontaneous sex with almost no foreplay and no dilating beforehand and it was only mildly uncomfortable for the first 10-15 seconds and after that I was good to go!

""Take orgasms. In 2016, O’Connell co-authored a paper that found, based on a series of macroscopic anatomical dissections, that there was no evidence of erectile tissue in the vaginal wall – in other words, that the G-spot did not exist. (O’Connell has stressed there was more work to be done on the subject, including mapping the urethra.) To date, the only known erectile tissue in the area is the clitoris, leading to the working theory that the G-spot is just the engorged bulbs of an aroused clitoris felt through the vaginal wall.""

I have two such conditions, pcos and endometriosis. It is *staggering* how little these conditions have been investigated given their possible  severity (pretty much not at all until that recently) how little there is in understanding and treatment (Doctors pretty much just put a plaster over it without investigating or treating a cause) and effective treatments -good luck in actually receiving them. Because it's a ""female problem"" and isn't going to kill me. I have had doctors tell me there is nothing wrong, accuse me of lying about the severity of pain, tell me I just needed to lose weight (I was underweight at the time!) I had to go through 2 doctors just go get a diagnosis. And when I did, which i was relieved because for 5 days every month I was curled up on the bathroom floor white with pain, only to be told to come back and they will treat me *when I wanted to conceive.* They didn't register I needed treating because I was in pain and only cared about my reproductive health  Because I'm a woman. I agree, there *is* a lot of research done into pregnancy and birth but that is exactly my point, I'm still a walking incubator to medical science, a function intrinsically linked to me being female which takes absolute prevalence over my personal wellbeing.

jm3ysa,"> I have two such conditions, pcos and endometriosis. It is staggering how little these conditions have been investigated given their possible  severity (pretty much not at all until that recently) how little there is in understanding and treatment (Doctors pretty much just put a plaster over it without investigating or treating a cause) and effective treatments -good luck in actually receiving them

There are tens of millions of dollars in current grant funding on research associated with PCOS and endometriosis (unfortunately, I can't directly link to my search results, but you can do the searches yourself [here](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/reporter.cfm)).  However, the endocrine system is very complex, and doubly so for women, so simple solutions are unlikely.  In contrast, there's almost no current NIH funding for inguinal hernias, which almost exclusively affect men.

I'm ***NOT*** denying that medical sexism exists.  I'm simply pointing out that, even in a hypothetical world where it didn't exist, a grant to investigate clitoral anatomy and physiology would have a tough time getting funded simple because there's very little money and it's competing with topics like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc.  Just because something isn't well funded, well known, or cured doesn't automatically mean it's due to medical sexism.

I find that most people who make these sorts of complaints have little or no experience in biomedical research or federal funding for such, and just assume that if any sexism exists, that must be the cause for any and every discrepancy.  My ""favorite"" example is people complaining about Viagra, when in reality it was simply an accidental discovery during human trials when trying to formulate a new drug for hypertension and angina.

TL;DR - medical sexism exists, but is not always the reason why something is unknown or uncured.",GeriatricZergling
jm3ysa,"I've moved a lot and have consequently seen many different doctors. I had several doctors who simply told me that all women experienced period pain, despite me having pain so bad I'd vomit and have visual auras. It took me eight years to find a doctor who was willing to do an ultrasound for my period related pain to exclude PCOS. I haven't been able to get a test for endo because there isn't a non-invasive test and I'm likely infertile anyway because of another health problem, so no one seems to be concerned. I've just been put on birth control (which does control to symptoms somewhat), but I would like to know and treat the underlying cause, whatever that might be. I'd also like to not have to be taking painkillers back to back for days in a row, I can't help but think that's probably bad for my health too.

It's known that for endo early treatment has better outcomes for fertility, but still I've been told that they'll look into it WHEN I want kids. I don't feel comfortable with the assumption by doctors that wanting children is default or inevitable but frankly that's not the hill I'm willing to die on.

What I'm trying to say really is just that I relate to your experience.

They often decide they'd prefer the funding to go towards something that effects ""everyone,"" even when the project they're denying may effect a larger portion of the population. It's part of why diseases that disproportionately effect women tend to be under researched and have poorer treatment options (eg. endometriosis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia.)

jm3ysa,"I am aware of the current research on PCOS and endo but it's 2020, 20 years ago there was next to nothing on these disease s (especially pcos) save a few papers and some studies on a handful of test subjects. It's great and exciting that studies are being done now but the results and advances of which I'm sure  won't help me for a good few years, if at all. Just because a disease is better understood does not mean that understanding will translate into treatment and medical practice. Especiallly a disease which is still considered ""women's problems."" As I mentioned, this is the normal reaction to me asking for something so basic as blood tests or to see a gyno. I'm treated as though I don't deserve these basic things even though I endure far more pain than is reasonable every month. And it isn't just a case of ""there's nothing we can do."" With the information I have received from testing I've managed to combat many symptoms on my own, diet changes, supplements etc. But why am I being my own doctor? And why do I have to put up with eye rolling and tutting just to get these tests in the first place? 

I am not asking for simple solutions, I'm asking for investigation. When I say ""treatment"" I don't mean a pill to cure all, I know that won't be the case, but I don't see an reasonable excuse for the medical neglect and contempt of these conditions.

I don't think you can really make that comparison. Inguinal hernias are a, for want of a better term, a physical failure, just to do with intestinal tissue protruding past the wall of a weak muscle. What is there to investigate? What is there to fund? It would be like funding a study on broken arms.  

I don't disagree with your point, of course clitoral anatomy is not a priority, but just meant to say that there is medical sexism at work far more than we'd probably like to admit. If men also suffered from pcos and endo I'm certain it would be treated with far more interest and care.",princessflubcorm

A male can find a female's nipples in the exact same place as his own. Only females have a clitoris though, they only have one, and again, it's much smaller and harder to identify. A closer analogy, IMO, would be like finding a guy's prostate.

Also, no fucking way your nipple is the size of a pea. Male nipples are larger than that, and female nipples are larger than male nipples on average.

The clitoris on the other hand is, again, WAY smaller (externally), hidden under the clitoral hood, and can possibly be obscured by the other parts of the vagina as well like the labia. Definitely not a fair comparison by any means to compare finding nipples to finding the clit.

jm3ysa,"The genitals of all humans are located in the same general location: where the legs meet, at the front and external. 

The clit is external, and actually hard to miss based on placement alone. 

The prostate is internal and towards the... Rear. So no. Not comparable. (Why do we have to compare everything women have to something men have to make it seem worthwhile, present and valid?) Again, sounds like you are committed to not finding it, even when given a map. Yeah a clit can be small, if it's small, she's not aroused. So if her partner pays attention to her pleasure, it will become easier to find. But only if someone is committed to looking in the first place. 

The nipple is hardly the most prominent feature on the chest. Many are not even located at the apex of the breast, male or female. A large mole can compete with it for size. 

I know what size my nipples are, thanks. Nipples vary. So don't embarrass yourself by explaining the anatomy you do not own, to someone who possesses it. It's just not polite.  

There are many body types out there. The nose or toes are hardly the most far reaching, forward facing parts. 

Most women know where their clitoris is. Society does a really good job of obscuring sexual education from women and shaming those who seek information as sluts.

jm3ysa,"No. If you looked through my comments instead of replying all flabbergasted and in denial like everyone else, you'd see that  [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/WomensHealth/comments/jm3ysa/the_sole_function_of_the_clitoris_is_female/gcqckgo?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) I provided a link to a credible article describing the clitoral glans as the size of a pea, which is admittedly slightly larger than a grain of rice, but close enough that I think you could understand how one person may use one descriptor over the other.

Also, your ""I'm 51 and have been around the block"" is literally *even less* valid than what I heard in anatomy class. At least my information came from a (FEMALE) educator with a textbook and a teaching degree (not a fellow student, what the hell). 

You're just assuming that what you've seen in your experience is a perfect depiction of average, which is almost never the case. I've seen my fair share of female anatomy in my time as well. Age is hardly relevant in making your experiences any more or less valid.

I'll say it again, as I've said multiple times now, the clitoral hood makes it appear larger and can help make it easier to find on some women, but not all women. Sometimes the clitoral hood can actually obscure the clit. Sometimes it's difficult to discern from the labia. 

All of which goes back to my original point. It makes sense that many men have difficulty finding and pleasuring a small organ that they don't possess on a body that is anatomically different from their own. I see so many women who seem hella resentful on here talking about how ""men aren't even trying"" and ""it's not that hard"". But in all honesty, I'm going to imagine that all those people seriously sucked at communicating with their partner. 

A penis is easy to please, and that's what a guy is used to. Vaginas are extremely different in terms of both structure and how to stimulate them, and it's genuinely unfair to just expect a man to understand your vagina without some communication. Even if he has experience with other vaginas. Your situation is a great example. According to you, you've only ever seen women with above average sized clitoris sizes. That would make things kind of difficult and confusing if you suddenly had a partner with an extremely small clit. 

My current girlfriend, I have no problem whatsoever finding and pleasuring her clit. It's very easy to see. But my ex, I dated for about a year and a half, and still had trouble stimulating her clit. She had trouble finding it herself even when masturbating, because that shit was super small and heavily obscured. I guess girls like that weren't on the block you went around?",Tmack523
jm3ysa,"The image on the article we're commenting on is literally of the structure of clitoris, including the internal part. Like... Idk.

I suppose my main issue with your comment was you said ""it's much,much larger than *you* think"" whereas I was specifically making a point about how it's external part is small enough to be difficult for some people to be able to find it, and there's nothing wrong with or weird about the people in those situations. 

The clitoral glans, aka the part of the clit you see and touch directly, is very small. Averaging the size of a pea.  The clitoral hood is larger, and can make the clitoris appear larger, but it doesn't change the actual size of the clitoral glans itself. Further, many female ""erections"" of the clitoral cavernous tissue (the internal clit you were referring to) go inwards rather than outwards, making the clit actually even harder to find in some women when aroused rather than easier.

So again, all this goes back to my point, it's perfectly natural and fine to have difficulty finding the clitoris. It's an elusive little friend sometimes. Just try to communicate with your partner if there are problems.",Tmack523
jm3ysa,"My nipples are definitely pea sized, like yours ; )",melbbeergirl
jm3ysa,"Stating that the nose and toes are far reaching parts doesn't change the fact that the position of nipples are homologous on men and women and they protrude enough to be readily noticeable. Many clitorides are well hidden and the vagina has a complex structure,  so women shouldn't just expect men to know what they're doing. As my guy was saying, communication is key.

jm3ysa,"Hi. Queer wlw here. I've had sex with well over a hundred women. Well. Over. First of all, the external part of what we consider stereotypically female anatomy is called the vulva. The vagina is the inside canal. Secondly, clits do come in different sizes but most range from a pea to walnut sized, from all the ones I've had in my mouth and face. Many women aren't taught about their clits AT ALL, so it's not a surprise that someone sexually inexperienced couldn't find it or had trouble. I don't know if you are male or female or anything else, but you absolutely do not get to tell women a single thing about their bodies, but I'm going to guess you're male or at least someone who doesn't have a clitoris. The whole two vulvas you've mentioned aren't the only two to exist. I've not seen a single clit that's as small as a grain of rice and my own is little larger than a pea when aroused. Your anatomy class doesn't mean shit when it comes to other women's bodies. Dead tissue does not act like living tissue and you'd be wise to remember that.

Which part specifically?",SsoulBlade
jm3ysa,"Hahaha really!? A *huge* difference?? Okay, how's this for a try.

The average green pea is 7.5-8.5 millimeters. The average grain of white rice is between 5.5-7.5 millimeters.

The difference is literally a single millimeter. 

""A huge difference?"" Is it? 

I mean, to me, that's a pretty small difference when talking about the scale of the human body itself as reference. A millimeter is literally the thickness of a credit card. But for you, that's a ""huge difference"". 

Honestly, you're just being super pedantic because you can't admit that you were wrong to be so shocked and in denial that the clitoral glans is truly quite small.

And you know what, just because you've had your head up your ass so hard about this, why don't we reference the [numbers taken by the National Library of Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1603495/) on clitoral glans lengths? 

To directly quote what I linked
> The mean (+/- standard deviation) transverse diameter of the glans clitoris was 3.4 +/- 1.0 mm. The longitudinal diameter of the glans was 5.1 +/- 1.4 mm. 

Lo and behold, the clitoral glans is actually closer in size to the grain of rice size range.
It has a 2.4 - 4.4 mm measurement one way, 3.6 - 6.5 mm measurement the other way. Shocking how that's smaller than a pea, and actually a teensy bit smaller than a grain of rice, but you'd have a general idea of that size if I said it was about pea sized or rice-grain sized.

Also, just in case you actually read the article, the 
> Total clitoral length including glans *and body* was 16.0 +/- 4.3 mm. Mean deviation 18.2 mm^2.
Part, it's important to distinguish that includes the body.

So now you have to ask yourself. Will you accept reality and the facts that I have laid before you, from two credible medical sources now... Or are you going to continue to argue a point you have still not provided any sort of sources or references on? It's insane to me how many people want to be like ""you're wrong, you don't know what you're talking about"" on this sub about women's health, while simultaneously talking about how uneducated everyone (including themselves) are about female anatomy. Yet still everyone wants to act like they know more about it than anyone else because of their own personal experiences. Ridiculous. 

Your only source was being 51. At least in my youth I recognize that there are many things I don't know so I can look them up and correct myself.

To answer your first question, it was wrong for them to eat and touch the fruit because God commanded them not to. They ate it because the serpent said that if they did they would be like gods, so ate it out of selfishness and disobedience. 
God said if they did they would surely die, which means they would now have to live apart from God which to live separately from God is death.

And at night the extra long ones go from the very front to far up in the back so you can lay any way you want, my white sheets were saved! I now use the kind in your photo but I do recommend looking into bigger ones, for pain I don't know how to help sadly I have heard of little stickers that you can stick on down on your abdomen and they can help mix the pain signals and help but it is expensive, almost got then before the pill because I was giving up but it's great on the go",CuddlesRequired

Earlier this year (the wee pre-pandemic months) a friend of a friend at a bar was collecting odds and ends in a weird box for her boyfriend. I didn’t ask a lot of questions, just dug through my purse to find something to contribute. Not having anything else, I gave her my years-old just-in-case tampon. 

A week later at work I had my first period after switching methods...with no tampons and no coworkers I could ask. I cursed the universe and took my lunch break to go out and get tampons.",moderatehippie

I donated 3x that amount, so yes I had an insane stockpile. The downside is the recent revelation of toxic period supplies, so I still use my overnight ones, but I started buying organic cotton pads. Dk for sure if I’ll donate all my other ones or not. The struggle is real. I do know that there’s less odor and irritation with the organic ones.

Edit: I should add that there's no noise/diaper feeling of pads. (And b/c no pad I can wear form fitting items) I'll simply wear a panty liner while they're in for extra leak safety. Also sleep soundly without feeling paranoid of lovely sleep-leakage or the wake-up gush. :)",Fitz_Henry

Instead of demonizing society by lumping people who aren’t **ALWAYS** hyper-aware (me, for example) into a category that is deemed “lesser” to you, and tossing your cynicism at every possible thread that you can: unlearn that god complex, and come down out of that ivory tower. 

Otherwise, you’re just some bitter asshole ruining a lighthearted post. And, yes. My mental health, and me recovering from a suicide attempt was more important at the time than some fucking wipes. Sue me.",TenorTerrace

lv6arj,"I am not trying to be hostile twords you, it is more that I am annoyed and frustrated that so many people have that attitude. I was ranting. I understand why you took it personally because it was in the context of addressing you personally. 

But know your remark was just a catalyst for me to think about this larger issue, and it isn't the first time I have seen people openly talk about being wasteful  which is why I am so upset. Womens healthcare products are a big, we use so many over the course of our lives we should take their consumption seriously. If we collectively did so we could run unsustainable brands out of buisness with our power. 

Whatever you believe, please don't talk about me ""mouthing off"" or stalk my page, it is rude and unrelated to whatever it is I am saying to you. I speak my honest opinion, I am an adult, not a child who ""mouths off"". Why are you using that phrase? Who am I mouthing off too? The patriarchy? Some role I should be subservient to? Am I less than another person, and therefore I am speaking beyond my station? 
I communicate my opinion when I feel like it, and I am within my rights to do so, just as you do so. 
It is literally none of your business just as your personal thoughts are not my buisness to hold against you. We're talking about wipes. I am not seeking to judge your character over wipes. 

I also have chronic pain, and my own serious health issues. I never said you didn't have disabilities or that I assumed you didn't. Why would I? I said that would be about the only good reason for someone to use wipes in this day and age - and that remains true. That's up to you to decide if that applies to you, not me. Maybe your mental health is a disability and that is fine. 

**If not,** ignorance is a fair reason, to an extent. Thats why education is important, I guess you were failed by everyone else by not being aware sooner. It's truly the fault of these companies that make these unsustainable products. I still have anger that people do not consume more responsibily, that's just the way it is for me. 

You can call me a bitter asshole all you want. I am just over the excuses everyone has as to why they aren't mindful about the environment. If we all carry on with that attitude of not taking responsibility, then we will justify the destroying of our planet because of our feelings forever. 
We all deal with heavy stuff, we all deal with extreme emotional events, it isn't unique. We have to draw a line with excuses at some point or we will run our planet and humanity into the ground.",None

i3audp,"Same here, here are some highlights of what I've learned: 
Get a small cup (or use the quiz mentioned in a comment below)
Take your phone with you when you're gonna insert or take out the cup (I use one of those bags that let you take your phone to the pool just in case because I don't want to get my phone dirty in any way) and maybe some lube if necessary.
Watch videos, read or do something that relaxes you and TAKE YOUR TIME when inserting or removing the cup. Make sure you investigate and try different fold methods (literally just Google menstrual cup folds, there's a ton of YouTube videos demonstrating the different folds)
Use resources like r/menstrualcups (let me check if that's the correct name, I'll edit this bit later), cause they go WAY deeper than the official resources (I thought I was ready to use cups because I'd watched all the videos a YouTube cup account had... Boy was I wrong and when I finally discovered reddit felt so much relief I could've cried)
It's ok to take a break and use a pad or tampon! It's something new and difficult to get used to inserting and removing the cup, but know that it's totally worth it when you get it right!!!! I've literally forgotten I was on my period every once in a while (after having taken sooo many meds for the cramps, cause mine are HORRIBLE)",carlations
i3audp,"I just dump my cup in the toilet & then wipe it out with t.p. when I'm at work. Once you get comfortable with them they're really so much easier to use than tampons.

i3audp,"I lived in community bathrooms for over a year and it was fine. Literally no one cared. At all. As long as I didn't make a mess or anything, no one noticed and the few who did asked some questions and tried a cup for themselves!

The big key for me was to push them back towards my spine instead of straight up, if that makes sense, lol? Eventually I got the hang of them & then I started using a cup. Now I mostly use a cup with a back-up liner, though I do use tampons when it comes on unexpectedly & I'm out & about.",Zorgsmom
i3audp,I use Playtex Sport tampons. They are shorter and don’t hang out uncontrollably.,aafryer

kssdkk,"TW: sexual assault 

Apparently courtney love was on stage performing and some creep got on stage and stuck a hand up her skirt.

Suddenly he looks horrified, not at his actions but that his hand is covered in menstrual blood. When I was told the story the person said the rumour was she purposely sort of clenched to get more blood to come out. 

I hope if true it was enough to freak out the disgusting man who assaulted her so that he never did something like that again.

It took me a bit longer than I anticipated to remove said cup, and it hurt like hell!

fibalj,"That’s a shame. I always hated buying toilet previously, because I like to not have to think about it for a while, but could only ever fit so much in a trolley (and then when I moved to home delivery shopping it was about how much I could store). Always ended up at one roll before realising I needed to sort more. Now, because we have a loft, the individual packs just get stored around the opening (when my partner is really lazy he knocks them down with the hatch key), we get 40 at a time and it lasts way longer than what the site suggests for two people, it’s on a subscription which warns me before it’s due to ship so I can push it back as needed, and I basically don’t have to think about it. Can also add kitchen roll or tissues to the order as needed as well.

lm4dkl,"Hiya! Sex therapist here! I love how happy and healthy you sound! I want to add for those in the convo saying they feel badly because they are in solid relationships and still struggle with these things that they are not always causal. Some bodies are just more susceptible to UTIs and yeast infections. And while natural lubrication is a sign of physical arousal, there is a concept called arousal non-concordance. It means that sometimes our bodies and minds are not in sync in terms of arousal. Our bodies may produce lubrication but mentally, we may feel bored, uninterested, etc. The opposite can also be true. There is no shame in using store bought lubrication or having a body more susceptible to infection, and neither may be a sign of your relationship health and satisfaction.",BackpackingTherapist

lm4dkl,"Wetness yes. Uti no. Although he could give you one if he had one. Men tend to carry them and they don't have symptoms like us because they have a longer urethra.the other thing is lubricant and stuff on condoms and just a guy's sperm can mess up your PH which is unique to you and when that happens it seems like an infection....it's not but it's the same symptoms . I have slept with a few in my life I'm 40 so I'm allowed but the first time I am with anyone my ph is messed up. Everytime it never fails. As long as it's not a super long time before I am with them again it doesn't happen again. But if I wait too long it will. It's been that way forever. 

And just as a reference rape victims can get wet  or even orgasm and it has nothing to do with enjoyment. 

So yeah in a way your right but not as thoroughly ad you think. The right guy can still mess up your PH occasionally or whatever. If you really want to know yourself learn about ph and things that change it or affect it temporarily and how that affects you.  It can explain something's sometimes.",AmyBeth514

htrq5d,I would certainly not be opposed to it lol,nemi-montoya
htrq5d,"Yes.  You have to do your best to determine if its vestibulodynia, vestibulitis or both so you can avoid triggers as best as possible and take action when you cant or dont want to.

Vestibulitis is more when you're having an inflammatory or allergic reaction that causes the issue, vestibulodynia is more when its nerve/pain related, and then you can have both as triggers.

Sometimes eliminating the source is all you need, sometimes its a daily allergy medication,  sometimes its hormones,  sometimes a mid-strength steroid is needed for a short course and then as needed.

But yes you can mitigate and treat vestibulodynia and vestibulitis",Thelastunicorn80
htrq5d,I though i had that before we figured out my vestibulitis/vestibulodynia.  Many people mistake CV for other things bc baking soda baths help the vulva feel better so I try and encourage people to have testing done before settling on that diagnosis but i do agree it is a condition,Thelastunicorn80

For everyone interested in buying: I do have an Etsy shop. It is Etsy.com/TheStringTheorist . I do not sell these pads, but I do sell other stuff, and take custom orders, including masks, bags, etc, made from all the same fabrics you can see in the photo. I do not currently sell pads because there are so many people on Etsy that already do, and I have not yet quality tested them (give me ~ 2 weeks to go through a period lol). Others have made recommendations for shops in the comments, However, if you are interested in supporting me specifically, message me on Etsy, and we will talk about it!


For everyone interested in how I made my own: 
Pattern: 3 inch wide Tango from Versodile

40 pads total in 4 sizes: Heavy/overnight (10), medium (6), light (9) and liner (15)

I picked lengths based on the disposable pads I have used all my life, and made the backs longer than the front. 

I used small pieces of scrap ribbon to color code them, so I could tell the differences without unfolding them, and between ones made from the same size. 

All were made with a Windpro fleece backing, bamboo fleece, and a cotton topper. 

-Heavy/overnight has 2 layers of 500gsm bamboo fleece, graded to where I tend to bleed,  and a hidden layer of PUL for extra security. 
-Medium was made with 2 layers of 500gsm bamboo fleece, graded to where I tend to bleed
- Light used 1 layer of 500 gsm bamboo
-The liners use 1 layer of 200 gsm bamboo

All topper fabrics with the exception of a few were from joanns/other fabric stores. Some were from custom fabric companies, which I will add in the comments.",GladSpell757

jut32h,"This part really concerned me too, but it doesn't stain if you wash them properly. Most people seem to wash them all at the end of their period. The trick is to use a stain busting detergent and only wash on cold. No hydrogen peroxide required. You would go through sooooo much peroxide if you relied on it. And the problem with peroxide is that it is only really effective if its put on fresh- but its also kindof a bleaching agent so it would destroy your pads over time and you would have to wash every single one immediately. You wouldn't be able to wait until the end of your period to wash them all. Usually, a pre soak, wash on cold with something like oxiclean , and double rinse does the job and leaves zero traces of blood. If it does, just treat the stain with another stain buster and rewash",GladSpell757

15ak0u8,I had a similar issue but didn’t realize it was thong related until now. I stopped wearing thongs because I developed two small hemorrhoids during the early stages of my Celiac Disease (before diagnosis) and thongs were irritating them and making them bleed more often.

I once spent 500 bucks to be told not to sleep with too many people (i had always used protection and had no STIs or other issues) and some lube.

Recently, as in the last year, I noticed my leggings, panties, etc. bleaching from discharge for the very first time. I don’t know what that means about my discharge but it’s more noticeable now for sure. 

I have one memory from years ago where I wore leggings without panties. I was sitting with someone and I was mortified when I stood up. There was a wet spot.

I also agree with most what seacookie89 said, it really came off like you're on bord with the poop floss thing too, because reading between the lines you countered an anti poop floss comment, thus seemingly supporting the poop floss thing. 

Sure maybe you didn't intended that, but also defended your move and invalidated seacookie89's  arguments by just saying  ""So I don't really understand the point of your comment 🤔""  making it seem like it was not valid criticism. 

Also since you're the aggressive one from the outside from the start to finish, I highly doubt you

>would of apologized and and toned it down instead

So maybe take your own qoute literally and become more self aware , most valid arguments are not an critique of you as an person but of your arguments and the manner it was written. You started to make it personal and passive aggressive,  so maybe take your own quote literally then:

I know you never did, and I never said you did either. 

When did you apologize?  There isn't a single comment in which you ever apologized so that's that.

>no one was even talking to you either. 

You're on reddit my darling, it's public if you only want to talk to only one person directly use the dm's for God's sake. 

>Jfc you and that other user are so sensitive grow up
You are the sensitive one , since you can't handle even the slightest criticism ,but if delusions help you sleep at night of course we're the sensitive ones, whatever floats your boat.

>I tried but you guys just keep relentlessly coming and commenting these outlandish things

They are not outlandish at all, you're the one framing it as that but from the outside you're making the outlandish claims. We're not coming after you relentlessly , this is not an witchhunt and no one is out to get you. I was just voicing my observations,  I don't have anything against you personally,  just disliked how you treat others on an public forum.

I also didn't came to rescue an user, I was just displayed this thread by the reddit algorithm and your attitude and the aggressive tone stood out to me, just wanted to chime in as an neutral observator since I don't know any of you and wasn't in the discussion.

>I don't know who raised you but remember if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything this was none of your business to even get involved into

First off , you're the one making this personal,  you indirectly attack my parents and thus my family, but I didn't . 

>if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything this was none of your business to even get involved into

That's an perfect way to get delusional,  if people only smear honey around your mouth. I was raised with speaking the truth and communicating directly as big values. Also the culture I'm from values directness and putting money where your mouth is, so it is highly valued to get to hear the truth with the positives and the negatives of your actions. If you only want to hear everything sugarcoated that's fine if you find people willing to engage in that delusion,  I'm not willing to do that. 

To wrap it up,  I have nothing against you as a person, I just dislike the attitude and tone with which you treated others in this sub, that's all. I too would like to put that behind me and just move on since I think we don't agree on much anyway.",gimme_a_second

I wish medical textbooks and anatomy curricula would include the anatomical and physiological sequelae of removing the uterus. The uterus is treated as if it's only needed for pregnancy. But it, along with its supporting ligaments, are essential to the integrity of the core / midsection. The severing of the ligaments to remove the uterus causes the midsection to collapse / settle which explains the big belly and flat back of hysterectomized women. The uterus also anchors the bladder and bowel so dysfunction can ensue post-hysterectomy especially in the long-term (e.g. incontinence, incomplete emptying). Last but not least, hysterectomy typically impairs ovarian function to some degree (no way of predicting how severe it will be). Normal ovarian function is essential to all aspects of health even long after menopause.",old_before_my_time

When I went through surgery for endometriosis in ‘03, I was put with a surgeon that didn’t even specialize in GYN issues.

1745f0w,">Is it because we think women with them are unhygienic, or too sexual, and therefore merit the joke as punishment?

The ultimate reason is to control women, our bodies, and our behavior through the traditional methods of public shaming and devaluing us for experiencing a normal human experience (body odor, in this case), until we are eventually coerced into ""submitting"" to the patriarchal expectations imposed on us by society. 

Society teaches us that women should be held to a higher standard of purity, which ultimately trickles down to things like beauty, cleanliness, and hygiene standards. We are supposed to look our best, because being able to be in *possession* of a beautiful woman benefits men socially. We are supposed to be better at cleanliness, because being entitled to a woman's housekeeping labor benefits men domestically. We are supposed to be ""hygienic,"" because we are not permitted to do anything that impedes upon a cisman's access to our bodies in any way, which benefits men sexually. When women become ""un-fuckable"" due to ""hygiene"" issues, it robs men of their ""right"" to use our bodies the way they desire to, which is offensive in the eyes of a patriarchal society.  

So, making jokes about vaginal odor is simply one of the many passive-aggressive ways that society shames women into being constantly vigilant that we are remaining ""fuckable"" and accessible for male use. 

This is also why society makes derogatory jokes about fat women in far more brutal ways than it does about fat men. It's why society makes derogatory jokes about lesbians and queer women & masculine women. It's why society makes derogatory jokes about ""spinsters"" and ""cat ladies,"" while simultaneously acting like the rise in single men and male loneliness is a ""crisis"" that should be taken ***seriously***. 

It all boils down to ensuring the continued cismale entitlement/access to women, and therefore maintaining a steady supply of viable women by socially coercing/conditioning women into remaining ""fuckable"" for men at all times.

It kind of looked like mold and was coupled with constant lower abdominal pain, fevers and a terrible smell. It was highly distressing. Go to the ER/Doctor asap.",RagingFlock89
14bfkre,"Edit for clarity: GO TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW

This is not medical advice, and I am not your doctor. Whenever you have health concerns, it is important to speak to a physician with whom you have established care.

With that out of the way, I wouldn't freak out about this, at least not yet. I am not a gynecologist, but like all doctors had to learn metric shitload (technical term) about OB-Gyn throughout my education.

1) These are almost certainly not eggs, both based upon appearance and location. Unless you have an immunodeficiency or traveled to some place with an endemic pathogen I've never heard of, this would be nearly impossible, and the morphology is wrong.

2) The black beads look like clots and/or endometrial tissue, likely that sat within the uterus for a bit before being expelled. This looks very very similar to old clots, or ectopic/shed endometrial tissue (lesions from endometriosis look VERY similar)

3) If the white discharge is odorless, it could simply be an inflammatory reaction to the blood. However without knowing your menstrual history, this is hard to say.

4) MOST IMPORTANT; Although these are almost certainly not insect or other parasitic eggs, the discharge and abnormal bleeding could be signs of something like a chlamydial infection or pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). This is often painful, but can be asymptomatic. However, if untreated it can lead to major complications like infertility. 
In addition, this could also be due to a molar pregnancy, which is basically when two sperm fertilize an egg or there is some other similar error, and instead of forming a fetus, it instead forms a bunch of cysts which appear similar to this. Usually this is accompanied by extreme nausea and vomiting (literally morning sickness but on steroids), but if untreated it almost always leads to death. However, with treatment like a dilation and evacuation it is almost always a minor illness.

In summary, these are not eggs (think before you speak y'all), but I would still get to an gynecologist ASAP just to make sure it is nothing serious. There are many more things it could be than what I have listed, but you need to get a pelvic exam sooner rather than later as better safe than sorry.

You should go to the hospital regardless, but if you develop a fever, cervical tenderness, pain with intercourse, vaginal bleeding, increased passage of clots/these ""black balls"", abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, confusion, lethargy, or anything else that feels wrong, go to the hospital immediately. This is likely nothing to worry about, but could be something very serious like an ectopic pregnancy which has yet to fully rupture, or a molar pregnancy.

TL;DR: Stop asking for complex medical advice on reddit, and go to a doctor.
I love this sub for the resource it provides, but I have seen a lot of bad advice and unnecessary fearmongering here, so be sure to take what you read with a grain of salt.

But to reiterate, I am NOT YOUR DOCTOR, just a kind stranger with an MD, and you need to see a doctor in person, preferably immediately as better safe than sorry.",masondino13

I'm leaning toward going to the ER, though. That's terrifying. Also the balls are far too uniform - enough that I'm worried they might be uh something introduced to your body,  not produced. Definitely bring a sample with you.

I know this will probably get burried, but y'all need to think before you comment. Yes, OP should definitely go to the ER, but the chances of these being eggs like so many people have suggested is so astronomically low as to be absurd.

I know that asking for medical advice on reddit comes with risks of getting bad advice, but if you come across a post asking a medical question, it takes exactly no effort to just not leave a comment and keep your thoughts to yourself.

If you do not have person or progessional experience with the problem being asked, do not leave a comment trying to diagnose the problem, or at least put a disclaimer.

I have seen people literally die because they followed bad medical advice they read online which kept them from getting care until it was too late. Your actions have consequences.

Thank you for leaving a serious, reasonable, and calm reply.

My gut is _screaming_ that this is a hoax/joke like some of the ones I've seen in my lifetime, e.g. ""blue waffle""* pics or the ""insect eggs/larva/spiders/whatever hatched from a woman's breasts!!""** (actually a lotus pod photoshopped onto boobs, but still creepy looking) pics from years and years ago.

Or an AI creation, which I'm pretty sure would be the most likely explanation.

HOWEVER: ya never know. The human body is capable of doing/producing some _bizarre_ stuff and it doesn't hurt to give advice that could actually help.

Even if OP's just posting 4 teh lulz*** you might have helped someone who _is_ having some serious and upsetting issues.

So, thank you for your reply.

I have helped with a couple of teratoma removals in the past, which are ovarian tumors which you can think of as cells which make body parts instead of a whole embryo. They aren't a huge deal medically, but when you cut them open, they often contain TEETH AND HAIR.

14bfkre,"Legal disclaimer; I am a doctor, but I am not your doctor, and this is not medical advice. Medical advice should only be taken from a doctor with whom you have established care.

This is an interesting article, but this specifically references spherical discharge after uterine artery embolization for leiomyomata (fibroids). During this procedure, interventional radiologists stick a catheter through your blood vessels until they get to the artery which is feeding the fibroid (a type of common benign tumor). They then place a plastic bead into the blood vessel to clog it and block the blood flow, causing the fibroid to die and shrink.

However, unless OP has recently had UAE performed (a very significant detail they seem unlikely to leave out), this paper is not relevant to their condition. Plus, the bead ejected after UAE would be hard plastic, while these are soft and powdery.

I left another comment discussing what it could actually be, but I can guarantee what is happening to OP is different than what this paper describes.",masondino13

mo47qq,"Maybe this is sexist of me but I am such a big advocate of asking for female doctors. Too many experiences of male doctors dismissing me, misdiagnosing me, not listening, and just prescribing me whatever the first thing they could think of just to get me out of there. They only ever ask about the one presenting thing I come to them with and never try to connect it with anything else.

Women have generally listened and explained and asked about other relevant things, even when they’re not sure what the issue is.

I had to go to the same male doctor 3 times for a weird rashy open sore on my leg that wouldn’t go away. Every time he kind of shrugged his shoulders and prescribed me antihistamines, bite cream, etc etc etc. Finally, 4 months later, he gave up and referred me to a female derm. It took her literally 30 seconds of my parking my butt on her patients chair to tell me I had discoid eczema.",crunchiestcroissant

I fight for myself like crazy now, to the point of flat-out saying a doctor isn’t listening well to what I am saying.

mo47qq,[deleted],None
mo47qq,"I'm so glad you found someone who truly listened – finally!

Just a heads up: if you supplement vitamin D, you need to also take magnesium, because the body uses up magnesium to precees the vitamin D. It's also a prioritized process, so will get fueled before anything else. Which means you can get cramps and other muslce problems, including heart ihccups. People are often low on magnesium to begin with, the vitamin D makes it worse. So supplement, and you can higher than any recommended doses. You can ramp up slowly, and you will have found your dose when your stoool starts to get softer. Magnesium doesn't get stored (so you can't overdose), and the body gets rid of the extra through your digestive system, which is why the porcelaine test is a good way to figure out how much you need to take.

I recommend getting magnesium citrate as powder and putting it in water you drink over the day. The body can only absorb a limited amount at a time, so if you take too much at once, the extra will get thrown out by your body, even if your full day's dose is far from filled in total.",WgXcQ
mo47qq,"Wow, thanks so much for sharing your story and I’m so glad you’re on your way to feeling better!! I think another thing we can all do to help each other is to make sure to review doctors—so if you have a minute it would do so much good if you make sure to publicly write about/review those doctors that ignored you (assuming you’re completely done with them—which, seems like you are!).

mo47qq,"I have been wondering if my chronic itchiness is caused by psoriasis too! Im so glad you were finally listened to. No one will listen to me yet. I tried to see a dermatologist for that but my doctor would only do a refferal for my itchy elbows and sent me to another unhelpful obgyn to tell me theres nothing wrong with me. I had an extremely painful vulval biopsy that showed nothing. I keep thinking my issue is something like psoriasis especially because my mom has it. 

When I  tried to bring up a possible psoriasis diagnosis and re examining what is wrong with me they just waived me off saying that there is no way that my plaquey looking elbows would be connected to my extremely inflamed vulva because that would be two different kinds of psoriasis. Which according to the internet is not only possible, but actually pretty common for someone to have plaque and inverse psoriasis. Sometimes I feel like I know more about things than my doctor by doing a basic google.. Several times I have been told what seems to be conflicting medical information than what I find on the internet from several sources. Its honestly so hard to advocate for myself when the power dynamics of my care are so weird.",Lovingwildlife

mo47qq,"Thanks for posting… considering going to a dermatologist… my gyno did a biopsy and it came back normal, but now I feel like the itch is spreading and it’s been 2 yrs… clobetasol cream helps but after I stop using it for a while,the itch comes back.",CartoonistBrave1021
mo47qq,"I have a female gyno. One whom I’ve always loved, felt like she really listened, and made me feel super comfortable. A few years back, during my yearly, I mentioned that sex had begun becoming painful to me. My husband and I had been together a handful of years, and things started to become uncomfortable, both upon entry and during deep thrusting. I tried to explain to her that I generally really love it on the rougher side but now it’s often painful. She said that, because women are so connected with emotions, she suspected that I just wasn’t mentally prepared enough or connected enough when we were having sex. That maybe I wasn’t wet enough, and it had caused pain, and now my muscle memory was conditioned to expect pain so it’s causing a cycle. I thought...ok. Maybe. Though not likely because he always takes care of me first and I’m usually pretty ready to go.  So she gave me some great lube and sent me on my way.  

The next year, I tell her that it’s still painful during sex. And not only that, my sex drive was decreasing. I told her that my mood seemed a bit nutty and I asked if I should think about getting off birth control to fix these things. She, again, says it’s my relationship. That the painful sex cycle probably made sex a hesitant thing and that my sex drive was going down in relation. That the tension in my mood and our relationship was most likely a symptom of this disconnect. Basically it was all mental.  

This year, my doctor wasn’t available for my appointment and they asked if I wanted to see a nurse practitioner instead or wait. I needed a refill on my birth control, so I saw this other person. When she asked if anything was going on, I mention my ongoing issue. Immediately, she was like “none of that sounds right”. She took a look and saw first off that I have a tilted uterus, which can cause pain. But she suspected that perhaps that wasn’t the whole of it, and she had me schedule an ultrasound. I came in, did the ultrasound, and it was discovered that I had adenomyosis. Which can cause painful sex. The only thing that can cure it is a hysterectomy, so I probably can’t fix it. But at least someone finally took me seriously! After 3 years. I was pissed. This woman also encouraged me to try getting off my birth control to see if anything improved, and it so did. My mood is better, my relationship is better, and my sex drive is through the roof.  

So women doctors can suck just as much as men, or worse.",DoctrDonna

mo47qq,I am very much so an advocate for female doctors. The only good male doctor I have been to is my PCP and honestly I probably should have gone to him before allowing all these other doctors to continue to give me yeast infection antibiotics and creams that weren’t helping. I am so glad you finally figured out what you have!,ps3226
mo47qq,"I used to be like this until my female gynae gave me surgery she wasn’t skilled enough for, told me to have a kid soon (I was 19) and told me that I would need surgery every 2 years for the rest of my life. 

I then saw a male gynae who told me my fertility wasn’t effected at all (and showed me how there was no disease on anything important), removed all the diseased tissue and promised me I would never need surgery again. I have had a full remission of symptoms since that surgery and I would honestly marry that man. 

I’ve been dismissed by so many female doctors, I now don’t care about their gender, I just want them to know what they’re doing.",disasterous_cape
mo47qq,This reminds me of the horrifying experience I had while pregnant. My body did not appreciate my changing hormones and I got the yeast infection from the black depths of the darkest corner of evil that has ever existed. It was a nightmare for months. I could barely walk all I could think about was the burning. My THIRD time going in for my monthly baby checks and asking for meds I saw a new female doctor who gasped at my poor condition and gave me a magic pill that saved me. The male doctor was just whatever go get some OTC creme. I will never have a male doctor ever again if I can help it.,dirrtybutter

mo47qq,It was a pretty overwhelming feeling getting the diagnosis. I finally felt like I wasnt crazy. I had read online at one point that anxiety can cause vulval itching and I started wondering if it was all due to my anxiety since I couldn’t find relief. I’m so glad you have gotten a proper diagnosis as well and I hope you have found something that helps!,ps3226
mo47qq,Yes exactly!!! I have always been an anxious person and many times I have had issues and  parents and doctors know I have mental health problems so they always tell me its probably that. You don’t even know how many times I’ve had an underlying problem and I waited until the last minute to go to the doctors because my parents told me it was all in my head. This experience really taught me to trust my gut. I hope you find the right doctor for you!,ps3226

mo47qq,"You really should go checked out and I hope you can find relief. Inverse and plaque psoriosis is actually very commonly seen together. My mom with an AI disease said that she has had both and I currently have plaque on my head and then the inverse as well. My suspicious is that a yeast infection triggered the psoriosis flare up bc I did test positive for yeast at first(when I did some research, there is some evidence they can be connected) but once the yeast went away, the psoriosis got out of control but they wouldn’t listen when I said the yeast was gone and that I thought it was something else.

It was also really hard to advocate for myself as well due to the power imbalance between doctor and patient. I was nervous to speak up because I worried they would get mad that I was trying to talk over them, but we know our bodies best and if we feel something is off, something is most likely off.",ps3226

mo47qq,The only other place she noticed psoriosis was on my head. I suspect I have it on my nails as well because I have the ‘psoriosis looking’ nails but she wasnt able to see because my nails were painted.

mo47qq,"This diagnosis has given me a new incentive to follow up with other things that may be linked Eg some joint pain and chronic fatigue. Plus random pains in my legs. It’s very eye opening to have a diagnosis like this. A little bit confronting but also a relief to finally know why my itch never went away before.

I have the same itch under my nose and for years my doctors have been giving me antibiotics for it. 🥲 or anti fungal ointments. As I got older the itch became worse too so it’s so good to finally know what’s going on.",Licorishlover
mo47qq,"I'd recommend buying magnesium citrate powder, *not* di-magnesium tri-citrate, at least not in powder form. It has a weird taste that I found off-putting and doesn't dissolve well at all. The ""normal"" citrate dissolves well and brings a slightly citrus-y taste I find pleasant. If you get capsules, it doesn't matter much, but with powder in water you have an easier time adjusting your dosis.

Magnesium malate is, just as the other two are, also recommendable as they all have a high bio-availability (means the body absorbs it well) and malate is also easy on the digestion. Some people also combine the two kinds, as they apparently do slightly different things, but I haven't done that yet.",WgXcQ
mo47qq,Oh that’s good!! Thank you for looking out for us ☺️,infinite_lion
mo47qq,"Yes! Since this post is from awhile ago, I have since found out that my symptoms were all caused by a more external yeast infection. I think topical antifungals and the standard dose of a single antifungal pill just wasn't fully working which is why we thought it wasn't yeast for years. My doctor had me try taking an antifungal twice a week, then every week for  a month and my symptoms became non-existent. It feels amazing to finally know what was causing me to be miserable for years. I hope you find out what's causing your symptoms too!  I don't want to scare you, but the punch biopsy I did was so painful and I feel like I regret getting it done. It was to see if I had something like lichen sclerosis, but of course if vulvar cancer is a concern that might be best. Good luck and take care of yourself!",Lovingwildlife

Was told to use tret at night, and use B and something else 3x/day. No warning to slowly build up tolerance to the product AT ALL.

needless to say, my face was raw, and it was so bad that i didn’t even care about my acne because i was crying from WIND. if i tried to sleep and a tear fell my entire face burned so so bad. I left them an awful review and never went back, but I spent a ton of money on those prescription products and wound up throwing them all away because I was so stressed out.

If you don't shave, you won't have the risk of small cuts, this entry points for infections.

It’s absolutely awful. I hope you can find a new doctor who never makes you feel this way. 

The worst part is, this isn’t unrelatable at all. As evidenced by so many of these comments. 

The question of why do people - especially those WITH vaginas?? - become OBGYNs if they are going to be judgmental or even worse, grossed out by the body part they chose to study and treat. It’s insane.

I once went to a gyno at 24 with my first yeast infection. It was written in the file- it’s what I came to check. Pretty standard I imagine as a vagina doctor with a vagina you’d have seen one or two in your life.

I will never forget the experience of having my feet in stirrups and her response to my yeast infection. She wrinkled her nose, made a seemingly disgusted sounding sigh and said “UGH, yeah it’s yeast.”

And I thought THAT was horrible - which it was. I’ve felt very insecure about anyone going anywhere near there with their face since then. Including doctors. 

And AGREE with an above commenter that said an OBGYN would tell you that hair is there to protect you. But then again, a conservative person who thinks marriage/babies is the only time for Sex may not fully believe/understand the evolution of the human body.

Unfortunately, it took a long time and a number of horror stories to find a doctor I really feel safe and comfortable with. I truly hope you can find someone who listens to you and genuinely wants to help you.",bagelsofsesame

I found a happier medium ground by keeping it nicely trimmed and clean shaving just the bikini line areas (that part is mostly a self consciousness thing tbh) so until someone can provide scientific and medical evidence that it must be one or the other do what YOU want and need to feel comfortable with your own body,Firefly_Serenity_365

ruvcsf,"It's also easier to tell around when your ovulating. I always could tell roughly by my discharge and because the closet I got to my peak...for women is around age 35...the more ummm turned on I got for 2-3 days around ovulation. That's really common but I didn't know that at the time. But those are a few ways to help try with out spending 💰 on fertility tests and all that. You can Google the discharge changes when the eggs coming if you're not familiar with that. And yeah if you know your cycles 30 days you know ovulation would be roughly day 15, 28 days day 14 etc. I wish you luck with the trying but don't stress about it too much. Everyone I know who focused too much on trying didn't get pregnant til they gave up and decided to wait or thought they could not get pregnant. So stress can affect it. So just have fun and don't pressure yourself. It can take a while for some people and no time for others. I bet within a year you will be buying onesies lol.

Also period headaches and migraines are very normal. It has to do with the drop In hormones in the days leading up to it. I used to get a migraine the first day of every period or the day before. It was horrible. But there's a direct link with headaches and hormone fluctuations like those around period time and around ovulation. Obv it doesn't happen to everyone but some people are more sensitive than others to it. Birth control can alter that a little bit so now that it's gone....bigger fluctuations again. I just use Excedrin migraine. Advil sometimes works but with caffeine. I use Advil for cramps as it's a godsend. But Excedrin for the headaches. Hope that helps.",AmyBeth514

nmaos8,"Hi Dr. Gunter!  My question relates to vaginal “inclusion” cysts. I have one (or at least, my obgyn said that’s what it was- it was not biopsied). Originally I thought it might be a bartholin cyst because I’ve already lost one bartholin gland (7years ago), but it’s internal rather than external like the other one was so I believe it’s not a bartholin cyst. Anyway, I am 43 and have never had children, and I’m embarrassed to say I also hadn’t had sex recently before this thing showed up. There’s been no trauma at all other than perhaps the genera pelvic “trauma” of vigorous CrossFit. I guess my question is whether these can have any other causes, or if it would perhaps be worth getting a second opinion and perhaps a biopsy?  All I can find from Dr Google is that trauma is the cause of inclusion cysts. 

Edited to add:  though I generally have raging endometriosis pelvic pain so it’s difficult for me to differentiate if this might be causing pain, I don’t otherwise have any symptoms like discharge, itchiness, etc.

Why does plan B make my PMS symptoms so much worse? Like, one of the last times I took it, I had a mental breakdown about pirates, and intentionally poured soup on myself in protest because I was sad that my partner wouldn’t let me ladle soup into his collarbone divot. In fact, *every* time I take plan B, I cry about pirates & I also get a fever?? Is this kind of emotional chaos normal for plan B?

I have heard the idea of massaging olive oil on/around the vagina while pregnant to help prevent tearing when giving birth/delivering vaginally. Is this a thing? 

Similarly, I’m wondering if doing this would also help prevent pain during intercourse- even with lube I feel initial pain, like my vagina is too small and is being stretched (but after some time the pain goes away).

nmaos8,"Hello Dr. Jen, I know I'm late to the party, but I could use your help and advice. 

I was recently on my period, but also masturbated during that time, pretty rigorously..And had rigorous sex the week before. Near the end of my period I noticed extreme itching in the vulva/vagina areas. I thought nothing of it at first since I thought maybe it was caused by masturbating too much, I thought I just irritated it. 

The next day when I go to the bathroom, again there was extreme itchiness. But I noticed the skin on my clitoris and surrounding areas turned white and the skin then peeled off. This happened 2 days in a row. 

I since bought an OTC yeast infection treatment and the itchiness is almost gone. But Ive noticed what seem to be white patches in between the labia majora and minor. The skin did also peel in that area as well as on the clitoris. The clitoris looks back to normal but there are still white patches that are flush to my skin.. not raised or filled with pus in any way. 

Is this common for a yeast infection? Or could it be something worse..

If your pH is above OR below 5 when you use it then the pH of your **discharge** will be 5ish but the underlying factors that regulate your natural pH levels will not be affected which can be a good or bad thing depending on what's happening in the underlying vaginal structures and hormones

Hormone replacement, regardless of which hormone, can be tricky.  Because each person is different we obviously have different needs in terms of how much our body needs to make and keep circulating in our blood stream.  For instance I am naturally significantly deficient in all 3 but to take/apply the standard dose is way too much for me. Like bad too much.  And timing is important too such as i have a shorter luteal phase so if i apply it too early in my cycle i can prevent ovulation which ended up causing me to have my period every 2 weeks 🙄  I don't mean to scare you off of hormone replacement I just want people to realize that its not a perfect science since we all have different needs, its not like taking a tylenol and needs a professional who has the education necessary and a patient who learns their body.  Journaling can really help.

The mini pill will prevent ovulation, its meant to, so technically you'll be on a birth control with that treatment and while the side effects are typically much less, there are still side effects.  But bc its just progesterone its been helpful for many to prevent some of the side effects of estrogenic birth controls and also help stabilize the uterine lining for those who don't want to or just can't deal with hormone replacement which is also typically not covered by insurance.

What’s funny is when my dad asks why I don’t feel good and I just say “my thing” or “my woman problem”, he just simply accepts my answer. He’s not grossed out or embarrassed.

When I got there he had made chocolate covered strawberries and had a bunch of other snacks ready to go, had his room set up for the perfect movies and cuddle time, even had went out and bought me a heating pad.

I dated one guy in high school who just couldn’t understand that periods make me feel tired and sick and would get mad when I didn’t want to do anything during my period. Broke up after a month lol. My current bf of 5 years is amazing. He always brings me chocolate and rubs my back for me when it gets sore from cramps. He always asks how I’m feeling and has made efforts to do his own research to understand periods better. Men are very much capable of handling periods and it’s rude to treat them like babies who can’t deal with that information.,schmetterlingmull
ibps6k,"Sex while you’re on your period is the shit. Just do it in the shower and you’re set.

So shame me for that, boomers. My boyfriend loves having sex with me while I’m on my period therefore making him more mature about periods than 70 year olds.

He also cuddles me and feeds me my favourite foods and he doesn’t complain about me binge watching Grey’s Anatomy even though he hates that show (ever since season like 4 or 5) he doesn’t watch it because of something that happens.

His dad also brings me home a tub of ice cream so the men in my life are very mature about it. Sometimes. Sometimes they call me an angry menstruating leprechaun (short, reddish hair, Irish blood) but they mean it as a joke so it’s fine.",GoddamnAppleJuice

It's really odd to me that some people would shame women for something that's natural. Because they talk about it. I just don't want to lie about why I don't feel good or if I don't want someone over. If they seem repulsed, I may never talk to them again. It's an immature thing to shame a woman about. It exists and I don't see the point in trying to hide something that everyone knows exists.",FruitScentedAlien
ibps6k,"Isn’t it strange coming from another woman - particularly your own mother? I’m not defending her but it’s probably how she was raised by her mother and so on down the family chain. I don’t understand why periods are still so taboo, it’s pathetic actually. The world will need to wake up soon because infertility is on the rise along with genealogical conditions (probably due to all the plastic in the food chain and chemicals in sanitary products) and then well really have to start talking about things, if only to highlight just how big a problem it’s becoming.

Really happy to read that many people here have positive experiences with their partners on the subject. Personally, my husband doesn’t get a choice - he gets to know every detail particularly as mine floor me for a couple of days.

Now I don't find it awkward talking about my period to my guy friends. But I also have elder brothers and I don't feel comfortable talking about my period. It depends.But when it comes to partner IMO it should be okay.

Also according to me, guys should know about period. It shouldn't be a taboo, it's something natural.  They are going to have a partner/gf/girl-friend/ daughter in life. So they should atleast have some knowledge about this.

I'll not be okay with a man who's not okay with talking about periods or how it feels. Specially because I can be moody/ irritating or just have cramps all day with back pain. I'll expect the other person to understand.",oblivious-soul

I shed a tear when I read that the right for reproductive health care had been altered in such a drastic way in the USA by leaving it up to the states themselves to figure out, knowing it will effect millions of lives and not in a good way. The mortality of child birth is already so high in the US and now they want to force people to carry unwanted children into the world. 

Human trafficking will also start happening way more in the states, im sure of it. Like imagine being some underaged unfortunate chick from a state with no abortion possibilities trying to go to a state with abortion opportunities, when your family is against abortion or you already live in poverty and they dont have any means to help you with the child care of this child. Thats a great catch for a human trafficker to take down the roads, get the abortion done and then make the underaged person come with them with threats of violence or before the abortion with threats of not getting the abortion unless the underaged person does as they are told to.

You do matter and your experience matters just as much as mine facing a difficult to obtain abortion with two children in the middle of a divorce (not my choice) and my eldest has a rare genetic disease so he is blind with cysts on his kidneys and will need a transplant then eventually reject it and his life expectancy is 25 tops add to that he is severely far on the autism spectrum at 9 he only now began to speak as a toddler, I only heard mama for the first time last year, six months ago I got my first I love you and I care for him I teach him and I need to give my typical child attention to and I have to go back to school singe my career went dead stayin home doin therapy with him til I broke and had a nervous breakdown. I feel you on mental health man I validate that. 
But I can’t give a new child what is needed and at 41 with African American descent and it runnin in my family I have unmanageable preeclampsia very rare this early but still a nightmare and I was on birth control and I was fuckin raped and the plan b in the hospital didn’t work so here I am and if I feel your pain so can you feel mine?

My mom tells me to take the tampon out while I'm in the bathroom and change it.

But OP congrats!",Alisomniac8582
iwhste,"Not op, but I can try to help.

1. It won’t feel like you found a hole, you have to push it in to find it. You’ll know when you do.

2. Aim for the middle, don’t go too far in the front or back. It should be in between

3.it shouldn’t hurt. If you don’t insert it all the way it might be uncomfortable, so try to push it in as far as you can 

4. Don’t try to aim straight upwards, angle it a bit toward the small of your back

5. Try different positions. Some people just squat, others like to put one leg up on the toilet. Try different ones until you find one that feels right for you.",ProudRavenclaw24

iwhste,"Are you able to insert your finger? If it’s painful to insert a tampon or your finger, you might have a condition called vaginismus — which you’ll need to see a gyno about. 

If it’s a mental thing with tampons specifically, I find the plastic applicators to be way easier to insert. Although they aren’t as eco friendly, they’ll be much easier to learn with. Start with the smallest size you can find. Put your foot up on the toilet & try to insert the bulbous part until you reach the end of the bulbous part where it starts curving down, push the plastic stick into the bulbous part & then pull the plastic part out.

I went under around 9:45am-ish that day and it was only half an hour, maybe 45 minutes at most in the OR and the anesthesia wore off by the end of the day and I was able to go back to school the next day. Recovery wasn’t too bad. I had vaginal bleeding for a week which is normal and had to use estrogen cream on the stitches and then went for a checkup after six weeks to see how everything was healing. I was advised not to use tampons until after the six week checkup, and I actually still couldn’t use them for the next cycle after because the stitches were still too tender, but I was able to for the next one.

js8ho4,"I have endometriosis, before being diagnosed the first gynecologist I saw for my symptoms when I was around 11/12.

I thought her being a woman she would understand, but she said if her med students could come to work on their periods then I had no reason to be missing school for mine.

She hadn't examined me or done any tests. Had asked minimal questions but was comfortable saying a child should handle the pain and blood loss better.

It took till I was 18 to get my endometriosis diagnosed, which was 9 years after my symptoms started. Teachers were hardly ever understanding about it. One woman teacher told me at 16 I should just get pregnant to ""fix"" them. 

Strangely enough it was a male chef tutor who was the best about it. I trained for 2 years and he actually knew what endo was and gave me permission to leave the kitchen or classroom without asking whenever I needed to do so. 

Too much focus in school goes on attendance instead of students health and the quality of the education they are getting. Because its logical that a kid coming to class distracted by pain or illness probably isn't taking everything in.",LJnosywritter
js8ho4,"So I had my first period in seventh grade middle school. It happened a few months shy of a year after my mom died and so I missed out on some much needed advice for my first ever menstrual cycle. Happened during gym class and a really sweet girl in my class saw something was wrong, asked me about it, and personally asked my male gym teacher if she could accompany me to the nurses office because I was too embarrassed to do anything.

She then took me to the office where the nurse gave me a huge pad and sent me to the bathroom with the simple instructions to just ‘clean myself off’. The girl came back with my backpack as I was pleading to call my dad and go home for the day.

So he left work (a big deal) and talked to me as I cried. Everyone wanted me to stay at school and attend my remaining two class periods, even my dad. But he must’ve seen how embarrassed and upset I was because he took me to our local publix and went inside, phone in hand with google’s advice on feminine hygiene products, as I calmed down in the car.

He bought me too big of pads and a tub of ice cream (which I didn’t ask for but he insisted it was required). We went home, I took a hot shower and went through three pads before figuring out the best position in my underwear, and my dad and I watched Marvel movies and ate ice cream until he had to leave to pick up my brother.

I’ll never forget how hard the faculty (women included) tried to get me to stay for TWO CLASSES when I had my first period. I really wish there was more sympathy for young girls struggling through their first. But I definitely would’ve had a worse experience if I hadn’t had my dad. I do miss him.",Cats_In_Coats

js8ho4,"They sometimes will if you get a note from your doctor and your parents. Probably easier to do now a days than when I was in highschool. I have had severe periods since I was 12 years old with both excessive bleeding and severe pains. 

Bleeding so bad that using both the largest tampon and largest pad together wasnt enough to contain it through a single class. On top of that I’d be in the nurses office every time to lay down without fail. First they tried just allowing the nurse to hold on to my pain meds, but when the laws changed on what kind of meds schools were allowed to keep on hand (even if you had a prescription) they could no longer keep mine on the premises as they were hard core narcotics. 

So then it got to the point that I’d have to go to school, check in for roll call, go to the nurse where she would have to call my parents and get permission for me to go home to take my medicine (remember these were narcotic pain meds) and then walk/ drive back to school after taking them. Every single month. Which was actually pretty dangerous. 

Finally they were just like get a note from your parents and a letter from your doctor regarding the severity of your period. After that if I got my period while at school I just let the office know and got to go home for the duration. Still had do all my work at home but I could do it in bed with a heating pad! 

The trick is the note from both your parents and your doctor. The school will call the doctor once after getting the notification to confirm most times. 

All this being said, your periods have to be pretty severe. I have endometriosis, dysmenorrhea, a tilted uterus and excessive bleeding to the point I become anemic each month and it often lasted up to 8 or 9 days when I was a teenager, so my case would have been considered special circumstances.

I’m in perimenopause now (middle aged) and it’s WONDERFUL. My period only last like 4 days now and I only have have one or two days of serious pain and bleeding. Can not wait for it to be done and over with. The hot flashes and mood swings are nothing compared to what my monthlies were like as a young woman.",None

People don’t learn as well as they can until their basic needs are met. For humans those basic needs are simultaneously physical and socio-emotional/mental. 

So really, our society and the institution of education as a whole is failing students,  teachers, and their families for not accounting for the totality of someone’s needs in state policy, district regulations, school guidelines, and grade specific curriculums.

This is problematic IMO. And it exemplifies the double standard, the misogyny that prevails in medicine and culture. 

The side effects of male birth control are comparable if not the same as the side effects women experience.  Furthermore, the industry never focused on increasing the efficacy of male birth control because of the prevailing misogyny.  Every pharmaceutical ad we see on birth control has to do with some new development about female birth control, not male.  Anti misogyny is often not good business. 

Obviously it’s an individual choice to take or not take anything.

But this idea that male birth control is out of reach bc men may feel uncomfortable is bullshit. 

What are the side effects to viagra? Or any other chemical that enhances “male masculinity” in any way? Men are just as willing to do through pain to have whatever it is they want. 

The expectation to preemptively taking precaution that may limit One of the “masculine” core principles of spreading your seed is what the issue is.

Modified school policy to accommodate boys and their inability to control themselves has historically places that burden on girls. Like the whole “are yoga pants appropriate school attire”thing.

So why not inform all people that male birth control is a viable option.",do-u-want-some-more

js8ho4,"I partially agree with you. 

I am talking about the space still needed in education that allows for each student and teacher to be treated as a whole person. For their needs to be considered in their education as a part of what they need to help them learn. 

Male female. Early childhood or higher education. We all need wellness days (physical or mental/emotional) and we shouldn’t be penalized for having our needs met. 

the patriarchy and misogyny negatively effect both males and females. And obviously disproportionately more so negatively impacts women and girls. 
So yes education is key for independence and self sufficiency for all people.  

But no one is ENCOURAGING girls to stay home during or bc of their periods.

The point is girls should not be PENALIZED for menstruating. They should not be penalized for taking a day WHEN THEY NEED IT because periods can be physically taxing especially if you have some undiagnosed medical condition that causes extreme pain, fevers among other things. But girls and women are expected to power through discomfort and implicitly taught to not listen to their body. It’s problematic and detrimental to everyone.

And don't feel like your pain isn't valid because others have worse pain. It sounds like it gives you a pretty rough time, can doctors help the side effects at all? 

I had an injection in my cervix as part of a medical procedure they do with you fully awake and it sucked. The whole process was awful and definitely has me not ever wanting to try an IUD. I could only really risk the copper one as my body decided a few years back to hate all medicine with hormones in.

Being on a regular oral contraceptive was partly responsible for me having a 6 month long bleed, which was when they did the procedure with the injection. 

Which thanks to a separate medical condition local anesthesia doesn't work well on me, I need a ton more than most doctors will give. So the injection that should have helped ease the pain of the camera going through my cervix didn't help at all.

> But it is normal for women with perfectly good health to have some pretty debilitating periods, speaking from my own experience and a lot of fellow women I know. No PCOS or endometriosis on my end, and I have had some catastrophic periods. 

Most women with no underlying conditions don't have debilitating periods. There's a crisis of underdiagnosis in gynecological disorders, especially endo, where it takes anywhere from 4 to 20(!!) years to get diagnosed, depending on the symptom(shortest for infertility, longest for chronic pelvic pain **DESPITE 70% of female CPP sufferers having endo**).

>Birth control methods like Paraguard can cause a horrific period too..

I have a copper IUD as well, have had it for over 4 years now. Day 2 of the period consists of 10-minutes waves of debilitating pain for about 8ish hours where I can't walk and need to curl up to see straight.

js8ho4,"I grew up and live in the east coast of USA. 

I disagree with you that American culture emphasizes women only be housewives. At least that perspective is outdated. That concept began to die well before women’s liberation and civil rights in the 1960’s and 70’s. Granted there are regional or religious sub cultures that do have a greater emphasis on “a women’s place is in the home to serve the husband and kids”. But mainstream culture for the most part expects girls to become independent women. 

Granted misogyny exists in a lot of ways but feminism and gender equality is a thing. The U.S. is very large and each state has its own laws and regulations. Some states criminalize abortion which infringes on the autonomy of female/women citizens. Then there are some states that better fund free medical care and sex Education for young people by having free clinics with birth control options attached to a public high school. 

It also depends on your own personal experiences, the way your were raised and how you see yourself in the world. 

Men and boys are capable and should be expected to value girls and women. That push will come from girls and women but the patriarchy will prevail if you discount the fact that boys and men need to change for them not to feel entitled to disempower women and girls to their benefit. Quality of life improves for everyone when girls and women are valued as whole people  

All the Men and boys, and girls and women in my life are for sure feminists even though American society is still oppressive in many ways our institutions uphold white supremacy/racism, the patriarchy/misogyny, and capitalism exploiting it all. 

That oppression is unwelcome more often than not when people become aware of how systemic oppression impacts their families and communities.

That being said semen saliva and lube can also trigger BV or thrush as these things can increase our vaginal pH also. 

Lastly being unwell or with certain illnesses or at a certain stage in life can also create an environment that triggers thrush or BV Eg taking antibiotics, being a diabetic, taking steroids, having a bad stomach, after giving birth, taking birth control, if your partner has asthma or if your partner is sleeping with other women.

g36lad,"Doctor here! Here is my hymen rant. 

A lot of people have misconceptions about what a hymen is. Most women have them, However, they are not what most people think. [For example, this is a typical ""intact"" hymen](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=36739136) is it what you expected? Probably not. 

It's literally just a small rim of stretchy tissue around the vagina. It starts out a bit thicker and blocking more of the entrance to the vagina in infants and children. It's possible it persists in infants as a way to prevent fecal bacteria from entering the baby's vagina (have you ever seen how close together those holes are?!) In children and young women, the hymen can be (but usually isn't) torn through activities such as gymnastics, bike riding, and horseback riding. In most women, it thins out and becomes very stretchy during adolescence, and is more difficult to tear from that point.

As a result, the hymen doesn't usually tear during sex. I will say that again *the hymen does not have to tear during sex*. [It wasn't until the 1990's](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1113684/) that this was commonly known among medical circles. In several studies done then, between 19% and 54% of sexually active women were found to have intact hymens with no signs of previous damage. 

If the hymen does tear during sex, it's likely due to one of the following things: the sex was rough, lubrication was missing or poor, the people involved were not properly aroused, or the people were inexperienced and the person with the hymen was not aware that pain or discomfort is not normal the first time, and should be addressed before tearing or other damage occurs. 

A very small amount of women will have hymen shapes that require tearing or [a quick surgical snip](http://www.gabrielledowney.co.uk/images/Hymenal-problems.jpg). Studies of infants and young children with these abnormalities put the percentage at less than 4%. HOWEVER, it's probably even smaller than that, because the hymen thins out during adolescence, and those hymens can normalize completely during this time. Hymens that completely block the entrance to the vagina must be surgically corrected, or menstrual  blood will back up after puberty and cause really bad problems. 

Don't feel bad if your hymen has torn. It happens, and it's not a big deal. Just about all women who give birth tend to have permanent hymen changes (one of two permanent changes that generally occur to the vaginal area after childbirth, contrary to the popular ""birth will stretch you out and make you into a hotdog in a hallway situation"" myth)

Another interesting tidbit: the hymen is vascular, but generally has no nerves. As a result, you may not feel it tear, but you may notice bleeding. Alternatively, if you do feel it tearing, that's likely because there is pulling on the vaginal wall with the tear, or because the tear went into the vaginal wall, which can be painful. (So slow down, use lube, and communicate!) 

Fun bonus facts: Elephants have hymens. Their hymens only tear after childbirth.

Edit: Another bonus fact: [Many people don't know this, but virginity testing is not even medically possible, especially not based on the shape of the hymen](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5437416/)",LatrodectusGeometric

g36lad,This is super insightful - I’m 28 and had no idea it served that purpose. The more you know lol thanks for sharing ☺️,minx888
g36lad,And that makes sense as to why you can break the hymen without having sex.,wildlingwest
g36lad,"Yep. It is not common to have an in tact hymen in your teens or 20s, that's for damn sure. Expecting there to be one to prove ""virginity"" is insanity. I don't believe in ""virginity"" at all as I don't differentiate people that have had penetrative sex from people who haven't. Sure, they have no experience but I don't believe in the word ""virgin"" and it doesn't represent anything to me.

I also think waiting until marriage is extremely risky as you'll have absolutely no idea if you're sexually compatible with that person, you won't know your own body or sexuality properly. Some guys just aren't compatible with me anatomically, everyone's a different shape, it's not all about big or small. 

I waited until marriage many moons ago and found out my ex husband took an hour to cum. Thst was really incompatible with me. His foreplay was also not what I wanted and his fantasies didn't align with mine. He couldn't seduce me, even though he was a sexual person and wanted to give oral sex and blahblah... I just didn't like his style, I didn't feel seduced and he didn't do it for me. Then the actual sex part sucked. But I didn't know any of that until I got with someone else after I divorced him. In my ex marriage, I just thought I was one of those people with a very average sex drive and that sex wasnt a big priority for me. I wanted it occasionally but it wasn't something that I thought about too much or got a whole lot out of even though I can orgasm really easily. But that wasn't just ""how I am"", it was how I was with THAT person and you just won't know who you are if your whole sexuality is based on one person. 

And to get back on track with the hymen... I got my period at age 10 and was embarrassed to wear pads with wings to school as someone might have seen them while I was on the playground or playing certain sports. There were no special bins for feminine hygiene products and pads were big, someone could have easily seen me put it in the bin and some of these kids didn't know what a period was, so I didn't want to be seen. Plus they just felt slimy and unpleasant to me. I decided at 11 that tampons would be better as my period wasn't very heavy and it would all be hidden for 6 hours. I practiced using them, I got one in after a few tries, it hurt a bit but only because my period wasn't very heavy so it wasn't lubricated enough. A semi dry tampon is still painful for me even in my 30s. I then wore it for a few hours and was told I should change it. I went to take it out but it felt kind of stuck. I had a look with a mirror and I realised I had some skin around it (was a hymen full of huge holes and hanging on by a thread), so I carefully took the tampon out of the biggest hole. I asked my mum and she said maybe you have a bit of hymen left, over time it will totally disappear. I thought screw that, I want to wear tampons NOW, so I went in the bathroom and got rid of what was left of it. It was more like just an extra edge of your vagina, definitely not a closed flap of skin or anything like that. The part I got rid of was just one string-like part that was getting in the way.

Of course the first time I had sex was not painful and did not involve bleeding. That's not normal to me. Girls and women should be encouraged to learn their anatomy and experiment with penetration themselves, before they involve another person. They should be taught how to do it in a clean/safe way and how it all works. Luckily people have the internet and forums to learn juicy details now, haha. Like clean an object thoroughly first, don't use deodorant bottles or anything with a lid because the lid could pop off/not seal well and you could end up with perfume in your vag... don't use electric toothbrushes because they're laden with bacteria... I dunno 😂 this is stuff I'd tell my kids, and they'd be like ""Omg mom, that is disgusting, stop!!!"", but they'd still take it in.",None

g36lad,"> In children and young women, the hymen can be (but usually isn't) torn through activities such as gymnastics, bike riding, and horseback riding

I'm just curious about something. For years now, I've been hearing from ""well-intentioned"" sources that an intact hymen that breaks during the first sexual encounter is not a marker for virginity, or that bleeding the first time also doesn't signify virginity. But the explanation these sources offer is that the hymen has usually been broken by those activities (gymnastics, bike riding, etc), and that is why it's normal to have a broken hymen, or to not bleed. Based on your rant, it seems this is inaccurate, so I'm wondering whether there's an explanation as to why then these myths exist. Even in sources who are well-intentioned, some sort of misinformation is still pervasive, which is just disappointing. 

That aside, thank you for the rant! I hope you don't mind that I will be saving it and using it during conversations with women who believe hymens are, as you put it above, a ""freshness seal""",Zanbakh

g36lad,"While some of your response is true, you still have a lot of false information. First, medical professionals do not use the term “intact” to describe a hymen. It does not start out thicker in infants and children, it only becomes thicker once it’s estrogenized which occurs at puberty. Then goes right back to being thin and friable post-menopause. You can only injure a hymen with penetrating injury. You can not injure your hymen with gymnastics or horseback riding unless there was an associated penetrating injury or in rare cases of straddle injury that causes such significant injury that it damages the hymen. Imperforate hymens are only found in approx 0.4% of the population, not 4%. The majority of women who give birth do not have permanent hymenal changes. The majority of hymenal injuries heal on their own and leave no signs of the injury (no scarring). While I appreciate you sharing your medical advice, I urge you to ensure accuracy of your posts when prefacing your message with “doctor here.”

g36lad,"The hymen can tear from tons of stuff. The hymen can also heal entirely from all sorts of things. It also frequently doesn’t tear at all. It’s pretty normal to have torn hymen (I don’t use the word “broken” because there really isn’t anything to break). But yes, most young women have not torn their hymen. These sorts of inaccuracies are passed down through families, shitty sex ed, out-of-date textbooks and physicians, religious figures, popular media and pop culture, and (of course) pornography.

Intact hymen is a lay term, and that’s why I used it in this setting, in quotes.

Infants and children do have a thick hymenal membrane.

Yes, straddle injuries are generally the associated hymenal injuries in gymnastics and horseback riding. I agree, most people in these sports go not experience hymenal injury. Some do.

Imperforate hymen are not the only hymen abnormalities. All told, unusual hymen shapes make up approximately 4% in some surveillance studies. I am not only talking about imperforate hymen here, and many of these hymenal shapes will change over time and most require no intervention.

Most women who give birth have hymenal tearing. Much of it will heal, but the majority of the time it will heal with notching, which is a permanent change.

I wasn't born with cribriform hymen (that's congenital and rarer), but I ended up with multiple holes by the age of 10/11. I needed to start using tampons and noticed I had 1 larger hole and a couple of smaller ones kind of attached to that. Once I snipped the connection of the larger one to create a proper opening, it all just was out of the way. I could get a tampon in but struggled to get it out once it was full because of the bits of the hymen that hadn't fully atrophied",None

8fr81f,"Holy shits-snacks!! Tht sounds mortifying, but I'm glad everything is fine! I've been using Diva Cup four about 4 years now and it's been AMAZING. Kind of a messy learning curve; not like a tampon where you can avoid touching your vagina, you get right up in there for a nice friendly greeting. Be sure to wash with cold water for less stains. I didn't need to boil mine very often, but it does help with discoloration. Mine didn't smell, but I did have to replace it last summer after our kittens got a hold of it during their ""everything is a toy"" phase. Also, if the DC doesn't work there are TONS of other cups out there for people of all cervix personalities! I'm so excited for you!!",grandmabrown
8fr81f,"OMG it is *painfully* embarrassing, but you're not alone. 

When I had just started having sex in high school, I was in the back of my car with my boyfriend. He had started to finger me and then stopped and asked if I had a tampon in. To which, I answered no because my period ended a whole day or two ago, why would I have a tampon in. He 'dug' a little bit, pulled out a (thankfully not very messy) tampon, and tossed in the woods out the car door. I was MORTIFIED, but that guy was a blessing and barely reacted. 

Obviously, I was glad that I didn't experience toxic shock and that was my wake up call to make sure I was changing my tampon - regardless of whether I needed a new one - every few hours/a couple times a day.",marymacmacmac
8fr81f,"This. Is fantastic. But also terrible and horrible and honey I'm so sorry you had to endure that!

To make you feel a little better: once upon a time I had a patient who came into the ER late at night. Mind you, I was just in undergrad and was basically a night clerk. I still got to hang out with the clinicians though since I was studying to be one and I was not annoying. 

I was working triage that night and remember trying to get her to tell us what happened. No luck. But there was definitely... A smell. She did finally admit she was worried something had gotten stuck in there, so into the stirrups she went. 

We had to shut down that entire side of the ER. The stench was overpowering. 

Her primary nurse came out with a face ten shades of white and green. We worked the trauma center on nights and weekends every week together. She had seen some shit. Mostly literally. But this... This was a whole new level. 

I asked her what the situation was, and she said they had fished out a week old tampon, a used condom that neither her nor her boyfriend could remember losing, and a couple of MAKEUP SPONGES. You know those little triangle foam things? Apparently she had run out of tampons and started sticking those up there. Then she couldn't get them out.

We called her Scary Poppins.",friedbunnies

pldl8n,"I saw that comment section and mentally went....oooh not gonna get on that train. Chlamydia is one of the curable ones,  but it can go years being asymptomatic. I worked with a nurse who lost her fertility because she was one of the ones that had it for years and never knew until it was too late. Her fallopian tubes were scarred beyond repair.  I also know of patients that found out they had it because a deceased partner she lost had it,  and they found there positive test on his post mortem exam and she was contacted by the health department. 

The thing that I always tell people is to test annually and make sure you know your status.  Sometimes finding the person who gave it to you will be hard to figure out,  especially if you've had multiple partners.  They're will be false positives because nothing is 100%. There always is a margin of error and sometimes it's just easier to take the antibiotics and retest a few weeks later, especially with the bacterial STDs and it's especially important with syphilis.",EzzieValentine

Plot twist I had a early yeast infection from being on antibiotics. 

It doesn’t seem right that they treat anyone like that especially if they question why or ask to be retested.",ayechiwaka
pldl8n,"As a RN, I can attest that lab errors can and do happen, although they are relatively rare. 

Testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia by NAAT is very accurate. However, at the end of the day, it is always possible that someone at the provider office mislabelled your specimen, or that your specimen got swapped with someone else’s at the lab. It doesn’t happen often, as there are safety checks to prevent this kind of mistake, but it can still happen.",alisonmg

pldl8n,I’m in a similar situation right now I tested positive for HSV 2 recently but I think I got a false positive because I recently had mono right when I got tested and before that I was clean but I did have unprotected sex 10 days before I got tested but I was clean after so it could be actually positive since it could’ve taken longer to show up but I’m praying it’s my mono because my gyno said that could’ve given me a false positive since it’s in the herpes family so now I’m in this horrible limbo and have to wait til November to be tested again and it’s been super anxiety inducing,artgirl7

pldl8n,"I'm not a doctor but I do have herpes and have been with my partner for almost a 10 years now, about 4 years ago I started showing some symptoms of herpes, short of a mild stinging/ burning in one spot, I couldn't see it so I just thought I had done something weird and ended up with a cut or like a friction burn so I ignored it thinking it would resolve itself. I ignored it until I couldn't anymore and took myself to the urgent care. They swabbed and I made a joke about it being herpes and the doctor told me ""It's herpes"". I was mortified, I was afraid my partner would leave me, not believe me when I said I didn't cheat. I got in the shower that night and sobbed uncontrollably until the water ran cold. We ended up talking a lot and he assured me he didn't cheat either,I believed him and I think he believed me. It always lingered in my mind how in the hell I got it and the only conclusions I came to were that he was lying, though he never showed any symptoms even now and he honestly isn't the type, or I contracted it when I was assaulted a few months before we even started dating. I thought it couldn't be possible to contact a STI and not show symptoms right? I started doing some research and found out that there are some STIs that can lie dormant, sometimes for your whole life and women particularly are less likely to show symptoms. Chlamydia, herpes, HIV and hep C Are among those. 
Moral of the story is you may have gotten it from someone else before you even met your fiance but most importantly if you don't trust each other your relationship isn't going to work out. I don't know if my partner has ever truly believed me but we have found a way to move past it and our relationship has lasted.

11zcysi,"THIS. I’ve been getting yeast, bv, or BOTH, every 2 weeks for the last 2 years. I’ve made every lifestyle change you can to prevent them but nothing works. 

Cotton underwear, no underwear, all natural detergent, washing my underwear separately with scolding hot water and vinegar, boric acid, different condoms, no condoms, all natural lube, got my bf tested just in case, switched to safe soap, tried no soap only water, lowered my sugar intake to almost nothing, grew out my pubes, no pubes, some pubes, got my water tested, take vaginal probiotics, started eating more yogurt, bf washed his hands before he touches me (which really gets me out of the mood), bf stopped eating me out for a while to see if that would fix anything, double doses of metronidazole and diflucan, toxin free period products, menstrual cups that i steam sterilize between every insertion, and the list goes on and on and on and on. Currently setting up an appt with my PC to test me for a myriad of possible GI conditions bc I recently read that GI health has a direct impact on vaginal health. 

ALSO, can we effing talk about the fact that every obgyn is giving DIFFERENT ANSWERS TO EVERYTHING??? I thought science was supposed to be fact based not bloody opinion based. The only good thing coming of this is being able to educate my bf first hand when it comes to this stuff and feeling validated when I see the wheels start turning in his head that there’s next to no proper female health care and next to no money has gone into funding research and better treatment options for women like there has been for men. He gets to walk into a doctors office, state his problem, and walk out with meds that he doesn’t have to doubt actually working. He’s genuinely appalled watching what I have to currently go through. 

I’ve probably spent $4000 after insurance in the last 2 years on Dr appts and medications. and that’s just for my yeast and bv. I have treatment resistant depression and CPTSD that I’m already spending a fortune on treatment for. I don’t have some rare health condition that nobody can figure out. I have YEAST AND BV. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD will somebody figure out how to treat me properly so I can stop dealing with this bs on a daily basis?? Also, I want a refund.",FloatOnBaybee

City water is routinely checked but they also use chemicals to purify it and if your body is generally sensitive like mine your body could be reacting to something a normal person wouldn’t. I recommend getting a water testing kit on Amazon. I had the water company come out to test as I figured they would be able to provide more accurate and comprehensive reports but they only ended up testing for 2 things along with the filter system to make sure it was working properly and were otherwise useless. Even if you aren’t drinking the water, people forget that your skin is your largest organ, anytime you bathe or do dishes or wash your hands, some water gets absorbed by your skin which is almost as bad as ingesting it if your water is contaminated",FloatOnBaybee

I heard you can get it prescribed by a doctor and that stuff is on another level. I do think boric acid is a last resort type thing tho. It really is like dropping a nuclear bomb on the bacterial level. Everything in there will die. I’ve noticed for me that sometimes that’s just gotta happen but if I don’t want the yeast to come back after that I’ve gotta use a lot of probiotic suppositories.

105ui3s,So far I have thrown up 2 times and blacked out on my period. I'm gonna be going to the doctors soon so I have to explain what's going on. My mom also said i'm probably going to have to take birth control as well.,I-ScreamSandwich
105ui3s,Couldn't have said it better myself. Thanks for this.,KekeKurves
105ui3s,"Yes! 

I'm just lucky in my workplace that I have days, and they typically don't question why I'm taking a day. Mine get real wonky, and even at 40, I don't know why. The last doctor I talked to about it says it's because I'm getting older and not to worry about it, and I was incredulous at her because in no way do I believe losing consciousness due to cramps is normal. 

Mine range from 1-4 days normally. If it's a one day period, I'm doubled over, vomiting, and can't keep changing products quickly enough. If one of those starts before my husband leaves, he does his best to stay. (He works in hospitals, and one day off around particular deadlines can mean the difference between releasing a ward or floor in time to be operational.) He says in a pale, shaky, crying mess during those. He literally stays home to care for me because that's all he knows to do for me. 

The 2+ days, I'm usually functional.",No_Feeling_6037

105ui3s,Oh really? Tell me how,spaimafemeilor
105ui3s,"Okay, well if we're talking about the States (as most of reddit seems to be from there), it is said that a woman earns 77-83 cents to every dollar a man makes (sources https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/03/what-is-the-gender-wage-gap-in-your-state.html and https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/economic-justice/wage-gap/ ). It is necessary to mention that a wage gap is valid when both sexes work in the same profession at the same level, yet are paid differently ONLY due to sex. Working less hours or at a less-paying job does not equate to a wage gap due to sex. 

When looking at the EU (more broad as it is multiple countries) we are looking at one of 17-13% *on average*. We can also see that Latvia has the biggest wage gap and Luxembourg the smallest (22.3% vs 0.7%). Sources (https://www.nwci.ie/download/pdf/gender_pay_gap_campaign_brochure.pdf , https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Gender_pay_gap_statistics and https://www.researchluxembourg.org/en/luxembourg-has-the-lowest-gender-pay-gap-in-the-eu/ ).

Most of these sources go as far back as 2020 and so obviously COVID impacted a lot, these studies don't often go into strict woman vs man pay, some of the women/men included may have been ill and so there is room for percentage error when considering these facts, hence why one source will say 17, another will say 13. 

What to take from it is that it is there with a simple few google searches and reading, and while you can't get an actual percentage just yet that's all the proof needed. It does exist, but IMO needs to be calculated more specifically.

Edit: Another key thing to note is that women tend to be less hired/promoted in male-dominated jobs that coincidentally pay more, while that isn't a wage gap related thing it is unfair. If a woman has the same education and skills, basing her value down to her genitals (thinking of maternity etc) is dehumanizing and makes it clear we are still far back in a society. 

This is not to say that every place in the States or EU will discriminate, but the fact that there is still discrimination SOMEWHERE in such developed areas is frightening. I personally feel put off by computer science, solely due to fear of being in a male-dominated field and being looked down upon despite me getting the same degree and working just as hard, if not harder (periods, as well as normal life troubles). Is this stopping me? No, but I am afraid. I shouldn't be.",Ok-Antelope8036
105ui3s,That doesn’t mention experience. Just because women chose shittier careers that’s not men fault,spaimafemeilor
105ui3s,"I highly doubt you went through anything of what I said or sent you in the 1 minute you replied. I clearly stated ""It is necessary to mention that a wage gap is valid when both sexes work in the same profession at the same level, yet are paid differently ONLY due to sex"". Yes, some wage gap statistics calculated it too vaguely and broadly, it would be unfair to compare an IT worker's pay to a teacher's. I have been careful with my sources though, you are free to look through.

kmmja1,"Yes! They never covered it in my sex ed, so for a couple years in middle school I thought I was incontinent and was too ashamed to tell my parents. When I finally did tell them, we went to a urologist, and it was only after THAT that my sister made an off handed comment about discharge, and that’s when I learned that I actually had nothing to be ashamed of. I was so embarrassed by what ended up being a normal bodily function, it still makes me mad that my sex ed teacher chose to spend our time telling us about how touching your face gives you pimples rather than, you know, sex ed.",aroha93

kmmja1,"yeah it’s so disappointing that as young girls were expecting to be taught actual important things about our bodies so we’re prepared when we start going through changes but most of us are almost always unprepared. at my school we didn’t even have a sex ed class... if we chose to take a medical related class then we would learn about the reproductive system and all of our reproductive organs but the only thing they focused on was men and male pleasure and pregnancy and a little bit on periods, but by that time i’m pretty sure most of us had our periods in 9th grade.",wwafawdwg8

kmmja1,"I switched liners. You can laugh, but Poise has very thin, breathable liners that are about half the price of the Always liners that feel too plasticky.

kmmja1,"From 5-8 grades we got 3 days a semester when boys and girls were separated for an hour of sex ed. In 8th grade, the vice principal spent one of those days talking about how gossiping is harmful to self esteem.

kmmja1,okay what.... my schools definitely failed me because we never got that hour of sex ed or anything.... i was literally clueless about everything lol. everything i know is basically from research in google and reddit randomly popping up as results. tbh i hated those anti-bullying type speeches because no one cared. the only people who cared were those getting bullied in some type of way or the ones having rumors spread about them. literally all the bullies and gossipers would just laugh. but i’m sure those boys didn’t get it and probably got to just chill and make jokes during that hour smh.,wwafawdwg8

kmmja1,"I mean, if it makes you feel better, most of those hour-long sessions were abstinence-based, so it was all looking at pictures of STDs and lectures about how terrible premarital sex is. It was more judgmental than educational.",aroha93
kmmja1,ohhh yeah that’s messed up. in 7th grade we had to listen to some person tell us about saving our virginity for marriage and they basically forced us to pledge that we would stay abstinent until marriage and made us sign something.... it was very weird but it was only once during a pe class lol,wwafawdwg8
kmmja1,Oh man you just reminded me that we had to sign a little abstinence index card in 7th or 8th grade.,aroha93
kmmja1,omg lol yeah those things were so dumb like no one took it seriously and instead of educating us on safe sex they just said no sex lol,wwafawdwg8
kmmja1,"Yeah, and maybe if they’d educated us on birth control, a girl wouldn’t have gotten pregnant in 8th grade. Oh, the joys of abstinence-only sex ed.",aroha93
